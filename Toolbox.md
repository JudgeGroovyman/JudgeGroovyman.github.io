    * I've got several AIs of my own but none of them really feel solid
    * I might have the enemy AI from the FPS Prefab
    * Probably I can come up with a super simple but solid AI that works well
    

### I've done these but they could use some work

* Portal

## Things to analyze to figure out what mechanics I know

# Game Structure

Mechanics aren't all about gameplay.  Sometimes what matters is how the game is structured and the framework which enables the gameplay to happen.

    * (advanced) Animated Title Screen
* Options Screen
    * Volume controls
* Pause menu
* Pause button (in game)
* High Score Table
    * Independent for each level
* Level Select
    * Simple grid based menu
    * Carousel menu
* In game level select
    * Drive to the left to go to previous level etc.

# Mechanics that I might like to learn

### Procedural Cave Generation
I've been through a portion of the official Unity tutorials on this.

### 3D Like on Facebook
I've got something about this in a bookmark or on facebook

### Making an RPG
The Games+James series is excellent.  Also Brackeys has a whole series on this.

### Making a dialogue system
Brackeys has a recent video on this

### Making an FPS
I have the FPS Prefab and know how to make it double jump.  


# Mechanics I dont know how to do or where to learn

### Making Shaders
One that makes everything sway or pulse bigger
Another that puts grass on the top of meshes but rounded over the edges



# To Re-create my coppercube game
I would like to be able to re-create the coppercube game that I made in its entirety.  I would like to make much more content for it.


* AI Character
    * Get a single simple AI character from the FPS Prefab working as its own prefab that I can just drop into a scene.
    * That shoots slow moving projectiles
    * With a cool looking enemy projectile with emission and small trail
* FPS Player
    * Get an FPS Prefab that can just be dropped into a scene.
    * With double jump
    * And with a standard weapon that shoots cool looking slow moving projectiles
* Enemies and Objects Explode into bits
    * With that exploding asset I bought
    * For some scenery add a little slim destructible layer that can be shot off
* Level Generator
    * Low Poly Rounded Cube
    * Generates a small field of rounded cubes
        * Varying sizes
        * Varying colors
        * Reminiscent to Level 1 of Super Mario 3
* Small constrained set of key materials (5-10) with normal maps
    * Grass
    * Bricks
    * Cement Bricks
    * Dirt
    * Red Meat
    * Metal Grids
    * Transparent Metal Grids
* I would like a set (5-10) of interesting normals to apply colors to
    * Geometric patterns
    * Bricks
    * Tile
    * Little Pyramids
    * Lego kind of thing
* Colors
    * Cull out my colors down to 16 colors + 64 patterns
