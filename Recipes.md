Update: Sep 23 2020
We didnt add liquid smoke we used smoked bacon pieces from Fiesta and they are already cut and perfect
A few days ago we figured out that 40 + 20 + 20 was about enough (we might have even done another round)
Today we tried 1:22 min (iow 82 min) with no keep warm.  That wasnt enough so we are adding another 30 min round no keep warm and letting it vent and it came out as a perfectly cooked bean soup.  Cook longer to get auto moosh - prob 20-30 moreminutes, or it will evolve that way in the fridge naturally.
