- 1tsp Garlic
- 4 Jalapenos

- Let it release pressure naturally


Update: Sep 23 2020
We didnt add liquid smoke we used smoked bacon pieces from Fiesta and they are already cut and perfect
A few days ago we figured out that 40 + 20 + 20 was about enough (we might have even done another round)
Today we tried 1:22 min (iow 82 min) with no keep warm.  That wasnt enough so we are adding another 30 min round no keep warm and letting it vent and it came out as a perfectly cooked bean soup.  Cook longer to get auto moosh - prob 20-30 moreminutes, or it will evolve that way in the fridge naturally.


# Chicken #
8 didnt work
Trying 18minutes.  When it was on keep warm and then after 11 min of keep warm I blew the lid and it was still bubbling and it was perfectly cooked thighs

put chicken in bucket
sprinkle with coopers spices
put 1.5c broth (for 1-3lbs)



# Rice #
x cups rice (rinsed until its not sending up a white starch cloud)
1.5x the amount of rice as liquid (for 2c rice use 3c liquid)

For liquid:
1. 1/2 broth 1/2 filtered water
2. all water but put it on simmer and drop in and stir up a buillion cube
3. all water if necessary

Push rice button on INstant pot
and Turn off keep warm 

When its done I'm not sure whether to let it sit there to depressurize or pull the plug to let the steam escape but i think pulling the plug is best
