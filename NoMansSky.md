# Tips #
- Hit T to turn on your 'torch' aka flashlight
- The higher above the planet you fly the faster you can go
- Fuel your launch Thrusters by collecting purple crystals (DiHydrogen), or the easy way, by collecting tritium from asteroids and refining it into DiHydrogen. 
- Fuel your pulse engines by using tritium from space OR Pyrite from rocks and mining
- Refine your extra Pyrite into Ferrite Dust to help make metal plating for your launch thruster fuel


# Life Changers #
* You can keep getting new slots by cycling space stations and upgrading exosuits and going to the technology or cargo menus
* You can use the mouse wheel to quickly change inventory quantities after youve picked it out of your inventory (this applies to inventory refiners too)
* You don't have to wait for galactic trade terminals to come up with their sell or buy buttons.  Just click where they should be and they'll show up
* One of the easiest ways to start a new base is to load one of your exocrafts with the gear you will need and just carry around enough gear to build the base computer and exocraft pad.
