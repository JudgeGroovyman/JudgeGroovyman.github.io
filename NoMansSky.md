- Hit T to turn on your 'torch' aka flashlight
- The higher above the planet you fly the faster you can go
- Fuel your launch Thrusters by collecting purple crystals (DiHydrogen), or the easy way, by collecting tritium from asteroids and refining it into DiHydrogen. 
- Fuel your pulse engines by using tritium from space OR Pyrite from rocks and mining
- Refine your extra Pyrite into Ferrite Dust to help make metal plating for your launch thruster fuel
