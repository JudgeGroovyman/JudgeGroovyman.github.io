## Setup ##

No matter what you buy or where budget for a setup.

1. Shipping: Even the best setup when its shipped will usually in my experience cause it to need to be adjusted again when it arrives.  This is due to pressure and temperature fluctuations and is perfectly normal.
2. Changing string gauges
3. Sometimes changing string brands
4. Leaving it out in the car (cold or hot)
5. Hint: If you buy it and it has really old strings on it then that probably means it has been a long time since it was setup

When I say "need to be setup" I don't mean that I expect you to go pay to have it setup for you to be able to play it, and indeed if you are happy with how it sounds and plays then there is no need to pay to have it setup at all.  Instead if those things above are not feeling or sounding perfect then a setup would probably help make it feel and sound perfect. Or if playing it is frustrating you at all, or if its harder to play than you expected or if it buzzes or if notes die or if the sustain isnt what you wanted, or if the notes sound just a bit 'off' for some reason, then a setup has a good chance of fixing those problems.

A setup should only be about $50 but I know thats not pocket change for just everyone so its worth budgeting in when you buy your guitar.

Some small local shops will change string gauges to whatever you want and do a full setup when you buy it from that store or if you play it off the shelf and it plays perfectly and has the strings you want then maybe you don't need a setup.

Some very small brands:
1. Crooked (like Ibanez)
2. Legator



### Semi-Boutique ###

Its hard to describe this range in fact I've never heard of anyone talk about it before but I would describe it as upper-mid level guitars without a big name brand and without being terribly fancy/expensive, but some incredible quality and value can be had here
1. [Haywire Custom Guitars](https://reverb.com/shop/haywire-custom-guitars)
2. Gordon Smith (a cool somewhat bare bones brand from the UK)
3. U.S. Masters (amazing quality and innovative features but I belive they aren't being made anymore)

Heres a video about great guitars like this [Great Non-Gibson Gibsons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aljGgg70Pg)



### Boutique Brands ###
1. Acacia (dubious history but they look amazing now)
2. Hartung
3. Gadow
4. Mayones
5. Maybach
6. Eastman
7. Knaggs
8. Solar
9. Warrior
10. Caparison
11. Suhr
12. Skervesen
13. Bailey
14. Kiesel

I don't know a lot about these in fact the only one I've played with my own hands is Warrior (I think!?!) but they are generally highly regarded and many of their guitars look and sound amazing!  I am unlikely to buy one of these personally unless I find a specific reason to.

Of course many Paul Reed Smith, Gibson, and Fender models could also be considered Boutique.  In fact most brands have a boutique range.  Some (ESP and Schecter for example) have high end Japanese ranges and Schecter even has a higher end USA custom shop.



### Name Brands ###
Name brands I think highly of:
1. Ernie Ball Music Man
2. Hamer USA (I don't think they make USA instruments anymore :( ) [Factory Tour with amazing carved top showing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wicSQKLVNs)
3. ESP (not LTD) (Standard or E-II Made in Japan)
4. Parker (I don't think they make guitars at all anymore :( )
5. Dean (Really cool high quality instruments)
6. G&L (not G&L Tribute) (Leo Fenders company) (Some less than $1000 NOS)
7. Peavey (Since the 1970s theyve been making all variety of reliable musical instruments.  At one point they were one of the only companies that sold everything a band would need to put on a show through the entire signal chain) The imports are fine but the USA models from the 70s-90s and early 2000s are high quality machine built instruments.
8. Ibanez (A fascinatingly important Japanese brand with MIJ at their top of line)
9. Washburn (A surprisingly underrated brand of quality musical instruments.  can often find for $5-600 for a USA les paul style guitar from their USA custom shop usually with duncans and buzz feiten tuning systems, and also nice neck comfortable joints.)




### Hugest Name Brands ###
1. Paul Reed Smith
1. Gibson
1. Fender


## Amazing Values ##

Heres an subjective enormous generalization of quality based on manufacturing location:
USA
Japan
Europe
Korea
Indonesia
China

In Japan one of the biggest guitar factories is Fujigen (aka FGN who also is a brand).  In Korea its probably Cort (who also have their own brand) or World Music International.

to find these use words like 
1. USA
2. American
3. Japanese
4. MIJ
5. Fujigen
6. MIK
7. World Music



### Korean Imports ###
1. Michael Kelly 
2. PRS SE
3. ESP LTD 400/401/256 series 
4. Schecter Diamond
5. Dean - Evo/Soltero/79

Many of the korean imports can be found used for $350 and they are excellent instruments.  The models from these brands that are less expensive aren't always so special but the korean ones are typically great.

P.S. Indonesia is apparently the new Korea when it comes to guitar building



### Specifics ###
My current favorite is the Cort G100 series (especially the ones with OP in the title).  The OP models have Open Pores which is a really beautiful stained finish.  They have single coils or humbuckers, are hardtails and are super cheap (often $125-150 shipped on reverb).   They are made of Paulownia and probably as a result they are incredibly lightweight.  

### Basic Guitars ###
1. Paul Reed Smith USA Mira/Starla/Vela
2. PRS S2
3. Gibson Tribute Series

Lots of these have satin finishes which cuts costs and is actually really nice feeling.  Often they dont have interesting tops but they can be fantastic guitars and new or used can be a great value.

### Upgraded Pickups ###
You can get an amazing value by looking for an affordable guitar with upgraded pickups since the upgrades typically command a premium that is less than their upgrade cost (especially in the case of affordable guitars).

1. EMGs
2. Seymour Duncans (Be on the lookout for Duncan Designed which are not worthwhile)
3. Dimarzios
4. Fishman (Fluence) (These are the new hotness)
5. Lace
6. Gibson
7. Fender Custom Shop

Boutique
1. Bareknuckle
2. Lollar
3. Fralin
4. WCR
5. Wolfetone
6. BG Pickups
7. Bill Lawrence
8. Suhr

Boutique that I barely know about (but probably should)
1. Ron Kirn
2. Danocaster
3. Hahn


### Premium Values ###
You'll often have to look for a while to find these deals.
1. ESP 1000 can be had for $500 ($400 if bidding on ebay)
2. ESP 400/401 can be had for $350-400
3. ESP 256 can be had for $250-300

5. Washburn USA Idol can be had for $500

## Lightweight ##

When I bought my most recent guitar (Nov 2017) I was in a bit of a pinch but was really satisfied with what I got.  In recent months I've thought about how heavy/light it is and felt like it was quite nice and light, although I might like one that is even lighter.

Last week when I ordered a new guitar online I decided to do some measurements and used my wifes postal scale and it measured to be 6lbs and 3oz and after looking around online I realized that is super light!  Its not common for guitars to be that light and I was really exciteds.  

Well this week when I got my new guitar I put it on the same scales and they didnt register it, so I tried my old guitar and they didnt register it either!?!  I guess that scale is broken for 5lb+ things (I tested some other things too).  I bought a new scale and unfortunately it says that my old guitar weighs more than I thought: 7lbs and 4oz or 7.25lbs!  Thats actually kind of shocking to me because of all of the guitars Ive been looking at online and mentally dismissing in the last week as "too heavy" and "way heavier than my current guitar so why bother".

### Woods ###
Some notably lightweight woods are paulownia and korina

Sometimes Swamp Ash or spruce or sitka-spruce

Any kind of wood can work when cut thin or chambered or the right size or just a lucky low density chunk of wood.

### Searching By Weight ###

#### Sweetwater ####
Only place i know to do this straight up is sweetwater.  Its only for their new guitars and only for the ones they have in stock right then.
https://www.sweetwater.com/c590--Solidbody_Guitars?sb=lightest

You can get to this by putting in a search term or clicking on electric guitars, and then solid body, and then in the filter at the top left of the list of guitars select 'Lightest Guitar'

#### eBay ####
Otherwise you can add the word 'lbs' to ebay and then in the search options click 'search in description'
#### Reverb ####
3. [Search reverb for 6lbs and then read carefully to find some](https://reverb.com/marketplace/electric-guitars?query=6lbs&sort=price%7Casc)  or you can [search for 5lbs instead](https://reverb.com/marketplace/electric-guitars?query=5lbs&sort=price%7Casc) neither of these solutions are perfect because the search doesnt only list guitars that are in the 5lb range but it does match some that you can read the titles to find some lightweight guitars


### Sellers which list the weight ###
Once you find a seller that lists the weight, in most cases all of the guitars they sell will also list the weight so you can bookmark that seller

PRS and Gibson Average Weights (from Sweetwater Listings) [OC]

Here are some average weights for PRS and Gibson solidbody electric guitars (not semi-hollow or hollowbody or acoustic).  All of the data is from Sweetwater.com who have weight listings for most of the solid body electric guitars they have photographed and in stock as of Feb 27 2020.

How did I get the data?  If you use sweet waters search filters for solid body electrics then you can sort by lightest guitar and then it puts all of the guitars they have weights for that meet your filter criteria at the top. 
like this: https://www.sweetwater.com/c590--Solidbody_Guitars?sb=lightest&pn=2

This only includes things from their solidbody listings so semi-hollow and hollowbody are not included in this data.

I did lots of clicking, lots of copying and pasting, a bit of spreadsheeting, and some extrapolation to get this data and its approximate and imperfect and of course representative of only one sample set of data.  Nevertheless it is interesting and helpful to me.  

What questions do you have for me?  Was this helpful to you too?

## Marketplaces ##
1. [eBay](www.ebay.com)
2. [Reverb](www.reverb.com)
3. [Craigslist](craigslist.org)
4. [Sweetwater](sweetwater.com)
5. [Guitar Center](guitarcenter.com)
6. [Sam Ash](samash.com)
6. [Music Go Round](musicgoround.com)

Some impressions: Reverb is excellent: theres a standard guarantee if misadvertised, fees are low for sellers (lower than ebay), its a good website, it doesn't have the advanced search tech that ebay has (like negative search terms or searching the description).  Ebay is excellent for different reasons: there is an expectation of a standard guarantee, you can use negative search terms and search descriptions as well as completed listings.  Sweetwater is the only one where you can search by weight (see below) and they seem to be a great store: they show pictures of the exact guitar you will receive and they set them all up before they sell. Guitar Center is just fine and has a lot of stores and therefore a lot of used inventory, for my money I would buy new from sweetwater instead though. Sam Ash is just like guitar center but they seem to have better used prices.  

Musicgoround has some good prices: some guitars are merely fair prices but others are much cheaper than you can get them elsewhere, the site itself has very little information about each instrument, but you can always call the store which has the guitar (they are all at musicgoround locations around the country) and try to get the information you need out of them.

## Cleaning ##

People online get into some seriously religious debates about cleaning guitars.  Woods, finishes, fretboards, strings, etc.  As a result there is no one answer to this stuff but lots of things to try.  

### Things to be aware of ###
Some chemicals and or oils can stain some fretboards. This can happen because you rub it on the board, or even just because its on your fingers when you play.  This can be a cool look but its worth knowing that its possible.

### Fretboards (non maple) ###
lemon oil
mineral oil (or baby oil)
coconut oil

Today I saw a bunch of dirt/buildup around the frets on my guitar and a microfiber with just a tiny dab of coconut oil and I pulled the strings apart and applied a bit of gentle elbow grease and it cleaned the board right up.  Took me about 20 minutes all told and it looks fantastic now.   One dab ended up doing about 1/3 of the board but I just rubbed until the cloth was totally dirty, then used the other side until I couldn't feel or smell the oil so much and then added another dab.  It took 3 dabs.  Id say if the oil were liquid then one of my dabs was roughly two drops.

### Strings ###
strings certainly have a tonal lifespan and undoubtedly start to sound dead after a while, and while its debateable whether cleaning strings would prolong their life, it certainly serves two valuable purposes: It prolongs the life of your frets, and makes it more pleasant for your fingers to glide around.  I had a guitar with dirty strings on it for a year (in my defense I was a kid and didn't know any better and also didnt want to restring my fucking floyd!) and it really wore the frets flat fast.  I used to use my dads 'Fast Fret' product but I never thought to rub any rags underneath the strings (naievely thinking it would magically clean under there as well.)

#### My Approach #### 
1. Clean them with just a dab of white vinegar or rubbing alcohol or naptha or mineral spirits on a microfiber and run it up and down the top and bottom of the strings to clean them and then
2. Smooth them with a dab of mineral oil, lemon oil, or coconut oil though on a different part of the cloth or a new one.
This worked very well for me and made the strings feel like joy.
