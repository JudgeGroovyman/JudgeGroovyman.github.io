Dont wait to get a new guitar to start making music.  Watch this video that says [The right gear is sitting right in front of you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRa4JHeLWLU) and then get started.  The work is making music.  New gear is perfect for someone who is doing the work.  Doing with crappy gear gives you the perfect opportunity to improve your workflow and productivity with new gear.  If there is already substantial work being done then by all means buy new gear and it could help inspire new directions or clear the path in the current direction and maybe you will get more or better work done.  HOWEVER
If you arent doing the work right now and making music right now its unlikely in my opinion that getting new gear will be the thing to get you to start making music and doing the work.  new gear can fan the flame and turn a campfire into a bonfire but it can't light the fire.

# Making Love to Guitar #
MLG = Making Love to Guitar


 Making Love to your guitar 
There is a subtle sickness in guitar communities (web and real world) that suggests that there are only three legitimate uses for guitar: Studio and Live.  Any other uses of the guitar seem to get lumped in with the pejorative 'practicing' (or worse 'noodling') at which noses are turned up and glasses are pushed down.  Practicing is important for technique but is considered a second class citizen only valuable for getting you to the point where you can use the guitar in one of its two 'real' and 'legitimate' settings: Studio or Live.

Playing on your own for your own purposes is not considered a first class thing to do. It is looked down upon and while theres nothing wrong with practicing or noodling if these things are not used as stepping stones to get to the studio or live environments, then they are even further marginalized as a 'hobby'.  But what if you want to play by yourself? What if you want to make your own live music just for you?  What if you want to play along with your favorite songs because its fun as hell?  What if you want to make new original live music by improvising with backing tracks because you love doing it?  What if strumming the same chord for 6 straight hours brings you joy?  What if you want to play on your own for any other reason?  What if you just want to be alone with your guitar?  What if you want to touch it and play with it and sort of make love to it?  

These are the things I call 'making love to your guitar'.  There is no reason why these things should not be a legitimate use of your instrument to create more joy in your world.  There is no reason why these things should not be a 'first class citizen' reason to play guitar.  

 In some sense some of these guitar activities could be considered a 'hobby' but calling anything a hobby makes it seem unimportant and in this case thats not accurate enough to be a valuable label.  Making love to your guitar is more than a hobby.  It is an investment in yourself and your connection with your instrument and your joy.

Who says that you are not important enough to attend a concert of one?  Who says that the VIP seats to the show you are putting on tonight shouldn't be reserved for YOU?
 
 The Un-used Making Love to Your Guitar Blog Intro

Does making love to your guitar strike a chord with you (guitar pun intended)?  Are you the sort of person that does any of the activities listed there?  Are you the sort of person who wants to?  Are you the sort of person who gets joy out of playing the guitar on your own?  If you answered yes to any of the above then this blog is specifically for you. Lots of products ( amps, pedals) and blogs, and youtube channels, focus on gear, tone, tech, and techniques, and this one will too but here we slice the problem against the grain.
 
This blog is primarily for people who want to play guitar at home.  More specifically this will focus on unusual solutions to the practical problems that normal people face when playing guitar by yourself for any reason and many of these practical issues arise due to having families, roommates, and neighbors, living rooms, apartments, condos, and are often related to volume.  Mad Science will be involved as often as possible.  Whether you want to make love to your guitar alone (see above) or practice or noodle or record at home this blog will help with all of those things.

NO: This blog isn't too terribly focused on playing live gigs (small or large).  Playing live isn't having an intimate love making moment alone with your guitar but instead we're all swinging.  In all seriousness theres nothing wrong with swinging or playing live this just isnt the place.  It wont be substantially covered here and the focus of this space will be on making things work at home.


 The need for tone 
I suspect that in some critical cases in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, the biggest difference between the person who got the record deal and the one who didnt is their learning environment:
1. Could they play all the time
2. Could they play loud
3. Could they play loud enough to get good tone
4. Could they play loud enough that their mistakes were evident
5. Were they encouraged and supported to play live shows (people taking them, helping pay for gear and travel, congratulating them, coming to shows, etc.)
6. Could they afford the gear that would get them good tone
7. Did they have access to information about what gear got good tone
8. Did they have access to information about what gear got the tones they wanted for their style (pedals, tube amps, guitar types)
9. Was their gear maintained well? (guitar setup, tubes maintained)
10. Was the first guitar they ever got setup well so it wasn't a battle just to play it?
11. If they needed to use headphones to play guitar were they decent headphones?

While an extremely motivated player could overcome most or all of these potential roadblocks, there are so many factors that could discourage a would-be guitar god and I bet there are hundreds of people who, if they had lucked into the right gear or the right level of support could have become important players and I bet there are a few great players of today who had they not lucked into the right gear early on or not gotten the support they needed, would have given up or not pushed forward as much and wouldn't be important today.  It could be as simple as their parents going to the music store and picking between two guitars where if they pick the strat on the right it happens to be easy to play and the pickups sound better, and if they happen to pick the one on the left its harder to play (becoming a struggle to get good sounds out of), and the pickups don't sound as good so its not as inherently motivating to play guitar.  Those are the kind of things which if they happen at a critical moment could make all the difference.  

If you were lucky enough to get a guitar amp in the 60s it was probably a decent tube amp by todays standards.  Sometime in the late 70s or 80s solid state started showing up and some of them killed peoples tones.  There are of course advantages which are just recently being truly realized for the most part since now a lot of solid state tech can sound wonderful and feel responsive.

I don't know a lot about most of these in fact the only one I've played with my own hands is Warrior (I think!?!) but they are generally highly regarded and many of their guitars look and sound amazing!  I am unlikely to buy one of these personally unless I find a specific reason to.

Of course many Paul Reed Smith, Gibson, and Fender models could also be considered Boutique.  In fact most brands have a boutique range.  Some (ESP and Schecter for example) have high end Japanese ranges and Schecter even has a higher end USA custom shop.

 Name Brands 
Name brands I think highly of:
1. Ernie Ball Music Man
2. Hamer USA (I don't think they make USA instruments anymore :( ) [Factory Tour with amazing carved top showing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wicSQKLVNs)
3. ESP (not LTD) (Standard or E-II Made or midrange Edwards all made in Japan)
4. Parker (I don't think they make guitars at all anymore :( )
5. Dean (Really cool high quality instruments)
6. G&L (not G&L Tribute) (Leo Fenders company) (Some less than $1000 NOS)
7. Peavey (Since the 1970s theyve been making all variety of reliable musical instruments.  At one point they were one of the only companies that sold everything a band would need to put on a show through the entire signal chain) The imports are fine but the USA models from the 70s-90s and early 2000s are high quality machine built instruments.
8. Ibanez (A fascinatingly important Japanese brand with MIJ at their top of line)
9. Washburn (A surprisingly underrated brand of quality musical instruments.  can often find for $5-600 for a USA les paul style guitar from their USA custom shop usually with duncans and buzz feiten tuning systems, and also nice neck comfortable joints.)



 Marketplaces 
1. [eBay](www.ebay.com)
2. [Reverb](www.reverb.com)
3. [Craigslist](craigslist.org)
4. [Sweetwater](sweetwater.com)
5. [Guitar Center](guitarcenter.com)
6. [Sam Ash](samash.com)
6. [Music Go Round](musicgoround.com)

Some impressions: Reverb is excellent: theres a standard guarantee if misadvertised, fees are low for sellers (lower than ebay), its a good website, it doesn't have the advanced search tech that ebay has (like negative search terms or searching the description).  Ebay is excellent for different reasons: there is an expectation of a standard guarantee, you can use negative search terms and search descriptions as well as completed listings.  Sweetwater is the only one where you can search by weight (see below) and they seem to be a great store: they show pictures of the exact guitar you will receive and they set them all up before they sell. Guitar Center is just fine and has a lot of stores and therefore a lot of used inventory, for my money I would buy new from sweetwater instead though. Sam Ash is just like guitar center but they seem to have better used prices.  

Musicgoround has some good prices: some guitars are merely fair prices but others are much cheaper than you can get them elsewhere, the site itself has very little information about each instrument, but you can always call the store which has the guitar (they are all at musicgoround locations around the country) and try to get the information you need out of them.



 Hugest Name Brands 
1. Paul Reed Smith
1. Gibson
1. Fender


 Amazing Values 

Heres an subjective enormous generalization of quality based on manufacturing location:
USA
Japan
Europe
Korea
Indonesia
China

In Japan one of the biggest guitar factories is Fujigen (aka FGN who also is a brand).  In Korea its probably Cort (who also have their own brand) or World Music International.

to find these use words like 
1. USA
2. American
3. Japanese
4. MIJ
5. Fujigen
6. MIK
7. World Music
(sometimes shipping is super expensive, but free shipping is available from certain us stores - search for mij free shipping)


 Korean Imports 
1. Michael Kelly 
2. PRS SE
3. ESP LTD 400/401/256 series 
4. Schecter Diamond
5. Dean - Evo/Soltero/79

Many of the korean imports can be found used for $350 and they are excellent instruments.  The models from these brands that are less expensive aren't always so special but the korean ones are typically great.

P.S. Indonesia is apparently the new Korea when it comes to guitar building



 Specifics 
My current favorite is the Cort G100 series (especially the ones with OP in the title).  The OP models have Open Pores which is a really beautiful stained finish.  They have single coils or humbuckers, are hardtails and are super cheap (often $125-150 shipped on reverb).   They are made of Paulownia and probably as a result they are incredibly lightweight.  

ESP Edwards guitars can be found for 5-600 used and are mij and amazing



 Basic Guitars 
1. Paul Reed Smith USA Mira/Starla/Vela
2. PRS S2
3. Gibson Tribute Series

Lots of these have satin finishes which cuts costs and is actually really nice feeling.  Often they dont have interesting tops but they can be fantastic guitars and new or used can be a great value.

 Upgraded Pickups 
You can get an amazing value by looking for an affordable guitar with upgraded pickups since the upgrades typically command a premium that is less than their upgrade cost (especially in the case of affordable guitars).

1. EMGs
2. Seymour Duncans (Be on the lookout for Duncan Designed which are not worthwhile)
3. Dimarzios
4. Fishman (Fluence) (These are the new hotness)
5. Lace
6. Gibson
7. Fender Custom Shop

10. Ares Swedish guitars for $1200



Boutique that I barely know about (but probably should)

 Quality 

 Something that really matters to long term quality (which might be the distinction between brands but its hard to tell): The Truss Rod
1. easy to adjust?  Well thats nice, but thats less of a long term discriminator thats just convenience
2. standard adjustment wrench? same its just a convenience
3. Will it hold up?
4. Is it oiled properly?
5. How much oil/maintenance does it require?  HOw could yyou possibly know this?
6. does it turn easily
7. Does it do its job booth ways
8. if in 15yrs its getting stuck and is accidentally cranked too hard, does it break? does iit detach?  does it permanently ruin the neck?   I dont knwo what is best or how to tell

My theory is that certain brands do it well because we have long term evidence that they do: fender gibson prs.  Other brands do it well because they do everything well: suhr, ebmm, prs, to a lesser extent: schecter/ltd, this seems like something that might be done better in a cheap guitar from fujigen japan than in other parts of the world and I believe fgn would do a great job of these

# Lightweight #

Backstory: In 1994 my parents bought a Peavey Detonator for me and it was awesome.  I wore the frets on that thing way down and eventually (because I didnt know how to maintain it or how string gauges and physics worked or how to take it to someone to get it really repaired properly) I got angry at it and in 2006 or so after years of being frustrated at myself that I wasnt good at guitar anymore I kind of put it away.  I thought that I needed a guitar with a "faster neck" in order to play fast and I thought I needed a guitar that "had more resonance" or "natural sustain" or something in order to play my favorite songs and sound great.    Turns out I was wrong and some combination of maintenance, repair, information, and practice would have been just fine/great but I didnt know that then and I was not satisfied.  It did lead me to attempt to repair it myself to save money (Should have just spent $150-250 for someone to fix it but alas) and probably ended up twisting the neck/truss rod too far (it creaked and might have popped idk) but It didnt play well anymore.  So I went on the search for the solution to all of my problems and found the Carvin DC127 and got an amazing deal on it (I think $240 shipped) and it was so beautifuland bad ass.  It played fast, it had low action, but after a few days I realized it had a problem: when I fingered a G chord my finger woudl slip off the g string because the fret was so rounded off.  That was annoying and I felt clumsy and felt like I should be able to worka round taht with my playing.  I tried to get that fixed at a guitar store to no avail but thats another story. A few months later I realized that it had another problem.  It was heavy as a ton of bricks.  I could play my peavey all night long standing up with a small strap on no problem, but the carvin after an hour it dug into my shoulder and after a few hours my back started to hurt.  It must have weighed 10 pounds (or so I thought) I looked for options to fix it and some people suggested getting nice straps which I did and that helped with the shoulder somewhat but not the back.  Other people said that heavy gutiars had better sustain so I should steel through the pain well that advice was crazy making and just made things worse and made it hard to accept myself as I was.  To be clear my back is not strong and I'm dealing with that even in 2021 but at the time I didnt know that and didnt realize that part of the reason I could play the peavey all night long and the carvin for just an hour or two was that I played the peavey all night long when I was 18 and the carvin when I was 28.  I didnt work out at all back then and sat at a desk all day long every day and it was catching up with me but I didnt realize it yet.  So I kept searching for a better perfect guitar never really admitting to myself that my back was not really ready to own and regularly play a 'heavy' guitar.  I read online about how les pauls were 13lbs but thats what made them sound great (I know its not as simple as that whatsoever now but I didnt know that at the time) and I kept struggling with finding a great guitar that was lightweight all the while thinking that the best guitars were only the heavy ones so that made me feel like I was going to have to compromise and I could never get the calculus of that compromise right for me and my needs in my particular physical situation.  I didnt understand what was necessary for good/great tone, or how to find it, and ignorantly believed myths and didnt have anyone to talk to about it face to face or bounce ideas off of.  So for years I would research for months and then find a great deal and buy a new guitar thinking this is going to be 'the one' but it never was and in hindsight there couldn't have possibly ever been a guitar that satisfied that itch.  I was not able at the time to figure out what was important to me and choose based on those values.  Then add into that that there were tons of guitars which were works of art or classic looks which got my blood pumping and I wanted all of those or replicas of them (although also in hindsight getting a replica would never have scratched the itch for the real thing).  and in the process I ended up getting some guitars which were heavier than that carvin and others which were lighter.  I eventually got a scale and to my eternal horror found out that the carvin is actually super average weight or below average.  IIRC the Peavey was 6.5-7lbs and the Carvin was a back breaking 1lb heavier than the Peavey.  What felt like an anvil to my brain based on what my back was telling it was actually only one pound of difference.  That blew my mind.  From some perspective one pound shouldnt make that much of a difference, and for some people it wont make any difference but for me it was a world of difference and mattered a lot.  It sitll does matter to me (more than ever now that I'm older even though fortunately I've started working out and my back is improving and strengthening over time) but now I know my values and what is important and what can be compromised and how to shop in a way that minimises the compromises and maximizes the benefits to my values and needs and it feels wonderful making decisions like this.  I didnt know how before but now I do.  Not to mention I also now know (mostly) how to maintain guitars on my own and also (mostly) when to take it into a professional and also (mostly) how to get what you really want out of that interaction with a professional.  actually ... that last part I dont know very well tbh ... yet.   Oh yeah and somewhere along the way I bought a 60lb tube amp and realized that weight really matters with amps too.  Had a funny experience with that too because I sold my carvin sx200 2x12 because it was so heavy and hard to transport.  Turns out it was like one of the lightest 2x12 cabinets you could possibly acquire lol it sounded great and was a great amp and I sold it for not nearly enough money.  Otoh I am proud of myself for downsizing even if not every decision was ideal and that was one of the worst and truly not that bad or that big of a deal.
When I bought my most recent guitar (Nov 2017) I was in a bit of a pinch but was really satisfied with what I got.  In recent months I've thought about how heavy/light it is and felt like it was quite nice and light, although I might like one that is even lighter.

Last week when I ordered a new guitar online I decided to do some measurements and used my wifes postal scale and it measured to be 6lbs and 3oz and after looking around online I realized that is super light!  Its not common for guitars to be that light and I was really exciteds.  

Well this week when I got my new guitar I put it on the same scales and they didnt register it, so I tried my old guitar and they didnt register it either!?!  I guess that scale is broken for 5lb+ things (I tested some other things too).  I bought a new scale and unfortunately it says that my old guitar weighs more than I thought: 7lbs and 4oz or 7.25lbs!  Thats actually kind of shocking to me because of all of the guitars Ive been looking at online and mentally dismissing in the last week as "too heavy" and "way heavier than my current guitar so why bother".





 Woods 
- Almost anyy guitar made of Paulownia is super lightweight:
- Basswood is often lightweight too but not as reliably as paulownia, empress wood is apparently lightweight too (probably empress IS paulownia)
- Some notably lightweight woods are paulownia and korina
- Sometimes Swamp Ash or spruce or sitka-spruce
- Any kind of wood can work when cut thin or chambered or the right size or just a lucky low density chunk of wood.
- [Material and wood densities](http://www.apsimplepsaltery.com/appendices/material_densities/)
- Korina is often light
- is Koa lightweight


 Searching By Weight 

 Sweetwater 
Only place i know to do this straight up is sweetwater.  Its only for their new guitars and only for the ones they have in stock right then.
https://www.sweetwater.com/c590--Solidbody_Guitars?sb=lightest

You can get to this by putting in a search term or clicking on electric guitars, and then solid body, and then in the filter at the top left of the list of guitars select 'Lightest Guitar'

Also check the 'in stock' to filter (it onlyy has weights for in stocks)


 eBay 
Otherwise you can add the word 'lbs' to ebay and then in the search options click 'search in description'
 Reverb 
3. [Search reverb for 6lbs and then read carefully to find some](https://reverb.com/marketplace/electric-guitars?query=6lbs&sort=price%7Casc)  or you can [search for 5lbs instead](https://reverb.com/marketplace/electric-guitars?query=5lbs&sort=price%7Casc) neither of these solutions are perfect because the search doesnt only list guitars that are in the 5lb range but it does match some that you can read the titles to find some lightweight guitars


 Sellers who list the weight 
Once you find a seller that lists the weight, in most cases all of the guitars they sell will also list the weight so you can bookmark that seller

"A heavier guitar isn't any kind of guarantee it will have better tone... I have a couple of hot rodded Squiers that have GFS lightweight Pawlonia bodies that have better tone than for example my 1977 Strat which has a fairly heavy natural ash body."

Douglas strat USA which is cut to be tiny and has huge slightly uglly weight relief and comfort cuts

The Leakesville factory was a dedicated guitar making facility located in Leakesville MS, about a two-hour drive south of Meridian.  To date your Leakesville Firenza, the best method is to remove the neck and look inside the neck heel. Most, but not all, Leakesville Firenzas will have the date of assembly written inside the neck heel in pencil." Some are ash and are 8lbs, others are basswood iirc.   Mira X might be made of Obeche.  I had a beautiful Dean Korina Czech V that was quite light too.

Phil answered my question about PRS and said that I could call PRS Warranty because it has something to do with the mix of the finish and may be separating. Mine was the last question! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UccHG4xTI-U


Apr 27

I feel like it would be awesome to have 3 strats: Alder, Mahogany, and Mahogany/Maple Top all with the exact same HH pickguards.  

I love teh look and features and colors of the Schecter C1 deluxe.  iTs probably a bit heavvy but probably a great beginners guitar


Cort g100 is beautiful and hardtail and thin body and made of lightweight meranti or paulownia open pore finish and comes in hh (probably the old model) and sss (probably the new meranti model.
Apparently the g110 is poplar and hss with a trem.  Also thin body.  Perfect beginners strat?  That or Pacifica probably


May 1

- Decided against the $695 Fender Lead I that I saw at the guitarshow with seymour duncan AND hsc.  then again its still tempting me.  Apparently theyy are super heavy.  When I picked it up it didnt surprise me.  It wasnt really heavier than I expected.  I should have weighed it with that scales.  That would have been the perfect time.  We got distracted by seeing our friends though.  That can't be re-sold for less than that so it is absolutely an investment and will only go up in value.  I dont know now.
- Loving the Jackson Dinky Minion one of them just over 5lb2oz and sexy HH shredders with tiny scale length.  Poplar so it will have an alder/ash-like tone
- Interesting how I feel about guitars and how those feelings change.  I feel like I want something until I have it and then my feelings about it often change.  It seems less than healthy but also I can accept that is how it is right now.
	- I wanted the most beautiful guitar in the world and I got it and now I dont need a beautiful guitar anymore (sort of dont even want one)
	- I wanted a legitimately top tier world class guitar I got it and now I dont need one anymore (dont really play it much)
	- I still love very much the working mans guitars that are built like a rock and for which I have no concern for their looks or dings or condition and which I know I can immediately sell for more than what I paid.  Thats true zero baggage.
	- I wanted a super lightweight guitar that was also super high quality and I got one.  Now I dont feel like I need a lightweight guitar anymore (and because I'm afraid to gouge it because the wood might be soft I'm kind of afraid of it)
	- I wanted a headless guitar but its kind of hard to fiddle with so theres baggage there.  Its so easy to sit in my lap though that I want all of my guitars to sit in my lap like that and its got no headstock to get caught on things so that makes me want all of my guitars to be headless (but with a simple locking tuning system that lets me easily undo the strings)
- I think I want alder poplar or ash, ideally 25"scale or smaller. 
	- Not basswood or paulownia for this tone.  Those are great tones but I want something else
	- My headless is ash
	- Jackson Dinky Minion
	- Ibanez Mikro
	- PGM Small one

May 3
- Cool Guitars Right Now
	- Epiphone Les Paul Special II Plus are quite beautiful tops and classy instruments with flat poplar bodies	
	- Jackson Dinky Minions are pretty much all less than 6lbs!  
		- They come in a bunch of colors including a beautiful blue to black blueburst which I love.  
		- Theres one that is 5lb2oz!!!
		- I would love a blueburst one but I also heard a 
	- Jackson RR V Minions are even smaller and probably even lighter!!!  also they will sit better on the legs
		- I kind of want all of the colors
		- And I want to either paint one of them or refinish one to look like Randy Rhoads
	
- Restring the Headless and set it up better
- Raise the nut on the green one just a tad
- Raise the nut on the blue one just a tad

# Playing #

Options for playing and learning and learning to shred
1. Play more often just for fun (jamming to backing tracks)
3. Play more rocksmith especially the guitar solos
4. Practice some of the solos I care about every day.  
	Study them and learn them by writing out the tab by hand 
	Write my own and rip and expand on them (this sounds best)
	Write my own based on some of my favorite solos that I cant play 
5. Play and write great leads with my computer on while looping
6. Play Rhythm and then stick a lead in the middle like Thomas Blug in his viideo about 
7. Make or get interesting Tool midi or beats and write new riffs and songs to them
8. Play with quinns app 
9. Write my own solos to my favorite songs
10. Write tab for your own exercises


Tips:
- Hollis at 7:59 pm Live from the Studio
	- "you just have to get good at finishing things"
	- "try something new, play the piano"
	- "This is the only thing I really like to do"
- Great video by Rober Baker "Whyy yoyu cant play faster and how to fix it" "For Speed you're not learning to play fast in enough different ways"
- [Learning to Improvise by Thomas Blug - How he taught himself ](https://youtu.be/ypRoV1nlCug?list=PLOdoSON10TXAQzSx6v67v-4VdENWWhqN1&t=4541)


- My Exercises
	- the simple lick in robert bakers play faster video with all three different pickings

I can write and learn to play fast by jamming to just a drum beat and recording it and then extraction and enhancing what I did and making it into a song and learning that song

In this [Paul Davids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qls1HQ-FaGM) he shows a cool arpeggiio that is now my favorite

----------------------------9---12-----------------------------------------
-------------------7---10--------------------------------------------------
----------7---10-----------------------------------------------------------

And Cory Wong says to do arpeggios based on the circle of fifths going counterclock which is a super fun exercise!



Training:
Paul Gilbert has an amazing site with hundreds of videos answering peoples questions
Tim Pierce has an amazing 100+hr course

See below in youtubers for more

Watch videos of Joe Satriani playing with no sound on like this
https://www.dimarzio.com/pickups/medium-power/mo-joe
or anyone else too

Constraints for learning
1. Remove Neck Pickup and only swap the bridge pickup
2. Do not use whammy (block it if possible or just dont have one)
3. Lower action (its a blanace ofc but sacrifice some sustain and some buzzing for ease of play)
4. Use 8s (if bending three half steps on 10s is easy to do over and over for your arms and hand muscles, then you are sufficiently strong so use whatever you want. I'm not that strong and lots of other people arent either and thats nothiing to be ashamed of just use lower gague strings - [see Rick Beato and rhett shulls video about string size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGXj_NQONYM))
5. Tune down 1/2step to eb.  
6. This one doesnt applyy if theres a good reason it isn't possible or good for your guitar: Get Locking tuners.  Its worth the investment almost every time.  If your guitar is neck heavy or will be there are some prs style locking tuners that dont weigh much.  But the regular lockinig tuners are someitmes heavier than normla tuners and could create some neck heaviness so beware.  Possibly do a test 

Tips:
1. Start small, I say start much much smaller than most people do .  Just pick up the guitar every day for starters.  Thne a week later plug it in every day and take it down every day.  or twice a day if you're really motivated
1. learn one of these licks to test out tones and guitars.  <insert 5 easy smooth flowing guitar licks> like a chord or three and then a lick in that key, and then you can test out guitars at the guitar store or at friends houses and always know something to playy that sounds cocol.  This is what to practice.  songs if you want too.  Yyou dont have to learn my stuff but you need ot know something you can play with some confidence and it has to be something fluid. starts and stops have to be intentional.  YOu can play it 1000 times and thats better than not having something to play, and you can learn new things as time goes on.  When it comes down to it even the best gear wont make you sound good if yyou dont have something to playy.

 Cleaning

People online get into some seriously religious debates about cleaning guitars.  Woods, finishes, fretboards, strings, etc.  As a result there is no one answer to this stuff but lots of things to try.  

[10 guitar hacks you need to know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lWMkADBlCw)

 Things to be aware of 
Some chemicals and or oils can stain some fretboards. This can happen because you rub it on the board, or even just because its on your fingers when you play.  This can be a cool look but its worth knowing that its possible.

 Fretboards (non maple) 
lemon oil
mineral oil (or baby oil)
coconut oil

Today I saw a bunch of dirt/buildup around the frets on my guitar and a microfiber with just a tiny dab of coconut oil and I pulled the strings apart and applied a bit of gentle elbow grease and it cleaned the board right up.  Took me about 20 minutes all told and it looks fantastic now.   One dab ended up doing about 1/3 of the board but I just rubbed until the cloth was totally dirty, then used the other side until I couldn't feel or smell the oil so much and then added another dab.  It took 3 dabs.  Id say if the oil were liquid then one of my dabs was roughly two drops.

 Strings 
strings certainly have a tonal lifespan and undoubtedly start to sound dead after a while, and while its debateable whether cleaning strings would prolong their life, it certainly serves two valuable purposes: It prolongs the life of your frets, and makes it more pleasant for your fingers to glide around.  I had a guitar with dirty strings on it for a year (in my defense I was a kid and didn't know any better and also didnt want to restring my fucking floyd!) and it really wore the frets flat fast.  I used to use my dads 'Fast Fret' product but I never thought to rub any rags underneath the strings (naievely thinking it would magically clean under there as well.)

 My Approach  
1. Clean them with just a dab of white vinegar or rubbing alcohol or naptha or mineral spirits on a microfiber and run it up and down the top and bottom of the strings to clean them and then
2. Smooth them with a dab of mineral oil, lemon oil, or coconut oil though on a different part of the cloth or a new one.
This worked very well for me and made the strings feel like joy.

Finishes
How to [apply guitar finishes in an apartment](https://www.tdpri.com/threads/advice-on-finishing-a-guitar-in-an-apartment.974673/) some say to just spray can in a parking lot or a public space, then you have to deal with wind but hey ...

Setup

No matter what you buy or where budget for a setup.

1. Shipping: Even the best setup when its shipped will usually in my experience cause it to need to be adjusted again when it arrives.  This is due to pressure and temperature fluctuations and is perfectly normal.
2. Changing string gauges
3. Sometimes changing string brands
4. Leaving it out in the car (cold or hot)
5. Hint: If you buy it and it has really old strings on it then that probably means it has been a long time since it was setup

When I say "need to be setup" I don't mean that I expect you to go pay to have it setup for you to be able to play it, and indeed if you are happy with how it sounds and plays then there is no need to pay to have it setup at all.  Instead if those things above are not feeling or sounding perfect then a setup would probably help make it feel and sound perfect. Or if playing it is frustrating you at all, or if its harder to play than you expected or if it buzzes or if notes die or if the sustain isnt what you wanted, or if the notes sound just a bit 'off' for some reason, then a setup has a good chance of fixing those problems.

A setup should only be about $50 but I know thats not pocket change for just everyone so its worth budgeting in when you buy your guitar.

Some small local shops will change string gauges to whatever you want and do a full setup when you buy it from that store or if you play it off the shelf and it plays perfectly and has the strings you want then maybe you don't need a setup.


At 19:52 on get the best plug-in tone by abel he says that a guitar with “light strings” 10-48 tuned to C# standard gets a massive tone

- Notes About Pickups:
- ------
- My vote will be for the SH5 but I have some thoughts. I have been where you are (although with a different guitar) and here’s what happened for me: I put the sh5 in a crappy guitar I had and was really happy with the tone but I thought I could get better tone from other pickups so I bought and sold guitars but just kept coming back to playing the cheap guitar because I could leave it out and never worry whether it got crushed or dinged.  That ended up being kind of my gold standard for all comparisons and then I was able to compare other guitars and tones to that one.   I honestly think that while there’s nothing ‘wrong’ with the stock omen pickups, any upgrade to duncans or dimarzio or bill Lawrence’s will bring new life to your guitar and you will be immsensely happy with any of them and will find none of them lacking, but will prefer some over others and that can only be discovered through first hand experience.  I don’t think you need sh5 to be that gold standard for you but I think when you get any upgrade to the Duncan/dimarzio level you will have a great sounding rig which can then be your gold standard for comparison where you can find your preferences from there.
- Schecter handwound superock - "They are some of the best pickups ever for all applications you mention. Powerful cleans which roll off beautifully and get into almost acoustic tones, even with dense solid body guitars. Tapped sounds are excellent as well but not fendery per se. they act more like what you hear on eminence front. The values are like 12k and 6-7k so your PAF sounds are available either full volume at tapped or rolled off some on full Monty. I use them for varying styles but mainly funky jazz slide rock and heavy blues rock with a power trio and also a jam band. 
They are very powerful but not muddy... they do jazz with the tone rolled off beautifully also..."
- "Duncan Designed JB/Jazz (HB-102) with logos removed. Here's a little tone secret: If you use 1 Meg pots or only 1 500k Volume (as I have here), it opens up the sound of Duncan Designed pickups to where they sound almost identical to an actual JB/Jazz. They're my go-to for my personal guitars."  from [How to make Duncan Designed sound fantastic](https://reverb.com/item/32645313-short-scale-guitar-w-warmoth-ebony-mustang-neck-fender-bridge-strat-grey-lomic)
- Warman is special.  Their comppany builds guitars and really knows what they are doing . They say they eliminate middlemen and make great pickups cheap.
- Entwistles website is unpleasantlyy slow
- [This guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLKv5atzLQ) says barenkuckle aftermath are the most fun to play or practice with and his favorite and then listen to that EMG57/66 set wow they sound awesomes and that the diimarzio fusion edges sound great, and that they apparntely come with some lower end ibanezes stock, 
- Wow every pickup company should have a 2d tone map of their pickups like rio grande does on their front page.  High output to low output on the y vintage to moderrn on the x
- I love the Fleors we just put in blue steel


 Pickup-Swapping-Guitars 

- Relish guitars have pickup swapping feature.  From $1299 (Sexy metallic blue with basswood body and open back for super easy pickup swaps) to $4500 for the guitar.  about $250 for a seymour duncan mounted in one of their special mounts.    That ultimately means we couldnt test cheap pickups in this on our own unless we figured out how to re-use their mounts and they are pretty expensive and not sold separately.  Thesee are sexy as hell though and I would like to be able to swap some of these pickups in thesee cages.  YOu can get a set of cheaper ones for $299 but can they be easily swapped IIN to the cages?  Could i setup a plug systme IN the cagese to swap them in?  I [really like these guitars though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nus7V9l_dHc)  I want to know how to add a new pickup to that rack.  Apparently thats not what they want you to do.  You send them the pickups and they mount them or buy them for $250 each from sweetwater.  Somnium is more expensive and doesnt look as cool but also doesnt pull that crap
	- Update: In [Darrell Brauns Pickup Comparison](https://youtu.be/EtFVRaCumBg?t=131) he shows how they are soldered in and its EASY you woudl just have to map which pin goes to which cable.  THEN after that you can probably figure out how to remove and replace the mount onto other humbuckers.  I could totally do this and it would be fun.  ALSO I could probably setup soem kind of solderless thing in that bracket too so it would be even easier.   Sweetwater says it voids the warrarnty on the bracket /pickup if you do that.  Of course it does.  i woudlnt expect them to honor that warranty at that time.  Theyy are $150 for crappy pickups ($300 for a set) which is cheaper than the Somniums
- Somnium has pickup blocks that let you swap them yourself.  USA Guitars  $2100 to $2800  The cartridges are $195 but each guitar comes with three of them.  
- ----
Reveho Slite (coming soon)  $1800 is an amazing COLLAPSIBLE guitar with apparently easily swappable pickups and beautiful wood and an amp built in!  it folds into a suitcase! OMG Less than 6.6lbs!!! USB C

 Mod: Pickup Swapping 
- GFS makes a plug for swapping pickups - OMG its only like $5-10 bucks per part!  
	- many parts are sold out but it looks like its a standard 2.5mm TRRS jack and if so I could probably get some splitter from ebay and just cut it and strip it, or use a 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter.  Note: It might already be 3.5mm
- Mojotone makes a solderless tele wiring harness foor $80
- Seymour Duncan Liberator is $30 for a solderless volume pot
- Obsidian makes a [solderless harness](https://obsidianwire.com/?aff=5) of really high quality (darrell braun affiliate link)
- Frog Dogs makes parts
- Hard Luck Kings makes prewired pickguards
- planet tone makes prewired pickguards
----- 
- Given a fully routed strat we could make a bunch of fully wired pickguards which [just had a plug to the input jack](https://www.tdpri.com/threads/rule-the-tones-many-guitars-in-one.630170/)
- "Even Cheap Harley Bentons kits have a solderless system...No that complicated !"
- Make My Own Relish 1: I like the idea of a large cavity strat but we put magnets in there and female plugs and then with some simple solderless make plug and magnets screwed into the pickup we can loosen the strings, unplug, pull out, plug drop in, tighte the strings.  OR MAYBE we could do all thtat with a trem bend?  That would just be lucky probably
- MMO Relish 2: route the back of a large cavity strat so I can drop the pickups ini from the back.  
- Some great workable pickup adding systems: 
	- [Female 2.5mm 4 wire tinned split](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZT7GH98/)  		   
	- [Male 2.5mm 4 wire split](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZT85PN7/)
	- [2.5mm breakout jack seems like what GFS uses](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sparkfun-electronics/BOB-11570/6006052)

	- [Cerrxian female 3.5mm 4 pole solderless TRRS](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BHBQ5YV/) 
	- [Cerrxian male 3.5mm 4 Pole Stereo Solderless TRRS](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06W2K9XMM/)  
	- [Poyiccot male 3.5mm solderless Speaker Wire Adapter short cable](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQTKMM7/)
	- -----
	- [3.5mm female Soldering terminal](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sparkfun-electronics/BOB-11570/6006052)
	
Could also use telephone connectors or something like those.  Also could use the connectors like the ones on motherboards for speaker and led lights, those are called [dupont connectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET1QTP1B7c&t=81s) which you use with a crimping tool, and there are kits with tons of these connectors for just a few dollars.  I believe thats what EMG uses for their quick connect and would work well.  Also related is 'pin headers'.  if I could get two female ones and use tiny male to male jumpers that would work but i cant find those jumpers, maybe I can pull them out of the pin headers or realign where the plastic is on those headers? Maybe the jumpers used in LED strip light connectors would work? 
Another possibility is using a bunch of male to female dupont wire jumpers and cutting them (you can get 90 for $10) apparently 8mm from pin 1 to pin 4.   some LED Connectors come with the jumpers that look compatible (unconfirmed though)
Other keywords:  bullet connectors, bullet crimp connectors, heat shrink spade connectors, Apparently white is the color code for connectors for the size of wire for guitars,
guitars use awg22 or 26,27,28 probably right out of the pickups its 28 and then 22 for most of the rest of teh wiring.   
Also 4pin fan or GPU fan or motherboard fan adapters or extension cables might work.  
Also low voltage wire connectors, brightfour quick solderless wire splice, quick connector, quick disconnector, screw terminal connector, spring wire connector, [Wago lever compact connectors](https://www.amazon.com/gp/cart/view.html?ref_=nav_cart),  universal compact wire terminals
Theres also solderless heat shrink butt connectors some are crimped and some have solder in there so you heat them up and the solder flows to make the connection between the wires.  If you did this right you could cut at the point of solder and then ppull it all off of the wire somehow.  
Also molex
Also EMG have a quick connect disconnect system as well as GFS and as well as gibson and epiphone and others.

 Mod: Installing an Active Acoustic EQ into an electric guitar 
- OMG I so want to route out and install an acoustic guitar active EQ unit with 9v battery compartment into one of my guitars!!!  THIS Is a BIG DEAL and I think would be a game changer for most people and so damn cool.  I wonder if I could even do a different one for each of the two pickups?  I wonder if the tone knob could be replaced with a more interesting EQ circuit and then I could have one per pickup?  I wonder if I could mount one of these it into the pickguard of a strat without routing out all that much more wood?

 Mod: Tone Controls 
- Another option is affecting the capacitor on the tone control.  Apparently that makes a big difference  THeres a Black Ice battery free overdriivve.  I wonder if there is a circuit with several capacitors and maybe a push pull that gives you tons of tone options?  3300pF cap is [a favorite of premier guitar](https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/27869-mod-garage-swap-that-tone-knob-for-a-warmth-control) and that article also has other options like 6800pF sounds interesting too
- I wonder if you could add a push pull to the volume knob to get a 20% passive volume boost for solos?  Maybe with the active EQ I could lower the volume in the standard position volume pot, increase it back to normal with the active EQ, and then boost by puttting the regular vvolume back to normal in the push pull setting?
- TIP: You can also set tone control to standard of 6 and then set your amps EQ accordingly to get some of the tone back.  and then hit the tone to 10 for a treble boost.  I dont think this is smart though because it seems like the ccut from the tone pot removes the frequencies and you cant merely add them back if they arent there in the signal to the amp..   I think this idea shows some promise though.
- Similarly mounting a headphone amp inside a guitar would be clever like a fender mustang headphone amp INSIDE the fender pickguard so the controls were sticking out and so you could plug into the cables would be so cool.  Kind of like the kay synth guitar
- "I prefer the acoustic sounds with my Wilde "Q-Filter" over the Piezo sound, and that guitar would benefit from the mid-dip sounds it offers."  Bill lawrence wilde q filter is awesome and is like unwinding your pickup with the tone knob rather than doing a coil split.
- Installing a Boost with Bartoliniis the chip https://bartolini.net/product/tc/
- orange drop .0223uf/100v cap 
- Instead of cts pots (too expensive but nice)Bourns audio for half price
- Instead of sprague orange drops get Vishay orange drops for a fifth
- [using a desoldering gun is awesome](https://youtu.be/mLJC11rF0c8?t=879)
- [JayLeonardJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKWhoPPOrEE) wires his strat to be super awesome
- Another option is to repurpose the tone pot location for a volume pot: 1 500k volume pot and one 1M volume pot, and you can wire the pickups to to either one in the back


 Mod: Make a V out of a strat 
Want to have some guitar where I pull abunch of wood out of the bottom where the strapp button is so I can play it like a V and so it relievves some weight.  And see what difference it makes to the tone

 Mod: Sustainer 
Also I want to have a Sustainiac on my guitar built in, could it run off the same 9v battery compartment provided by the acoustic EQ? 
Ebow
(also Acoufiend is a $79 plugin that does this)

 Mod: Piezo 
Also I want to have a piezo installed somehow with maybe a switch to that mode or a built in blend or soemthing?


 Mod: Trem King 
I want one of these so bad
Also really want a guitar with a trem king actually two of them.  Ideally with 25” necks


 Mod Locking Tuners 
Removing Tuner Compression rings: if [phil mckniights trick](https://youtu.be/NDM9lugiRCg?t=111) doesnt work instantly then [use this wiggle method](https://youtu.be/P_JOFOlmWaw)

Specifically for my PRS Mira X.  Probablyy the holes are similar to the holes on a USA PRS or similar to the holes on a SE or S2 but I dont know.  I will have to take one off and measure.  Further I dont want them to be anyy heavier than the current tuners if possible.  If they are going to be heavier then I need to test to see if it will have neck divve then with a few cleverlyyplaced weights

I just pulled one of the tuners out of the green guitar and took pictures of the holes:
.025*14 = .336 inches or 11.3/32 = .353125 so the hole is between .336" and .353" in diameter.  Thats between 8.53mm and 8.97mm 

Apparentlyy most guitars are either 13/32"(10mm) or 11/32"(8.5mm) but some vintage are 21/64 in front and 16/64 in back ..guessing that was mine?  lets find out.

Mine is 11.5/32 front and back.  The inner size of the hole is ... 1/4" or 8/32"
The weight of the tuners is 0lb0.8oz or 0lb0.9oz with the compression ring

Total weight is 5.4oz with compression rings.

1. $15+HipShot GriipLock open guitar tuning machines.    These should work great are probably prettyy light and can even swap the keys themselves for tiny little circles or plastics 
	- $90 [Heres a kit](https://hipshotproducts.com/collections/guitar-tuning-machines/products/vintage-guitar-tuner-upgrade-kits-3-3-headstocks)
	- They have $2-5ea [different button options](https://hipshotproducts.com/collections/guitar-tuning-machines/products/guitar-tuner-buttons?variant=43354478984) and a chart with their dimensions and weights.
		- Delta Amber is .07oz, Butter Bean Pearl are .04oz, Big Butter Bean .08oz, Industrial Metal is .13oz, 
		- Possibly Tulip Pearl is .1oz and Half Moon Mini pearl&amber is .05oz but I emailed to check on that.
		- THey also have a kit so you dont even have to drill new holes
		- The closed ones are 1.2oz per tuner
		- Weight of the vintage open ones is 1.2oz as well with mounting hardware
		- These would all be 1.8oz more
2. $27 Kaish Vintage styyle guitar locking tuners
2. $37 [Guyker locking machine heads](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08D2ZLG5H) they are rumored to be not machined as well so strings break and also they dont have replaceable buttons but they might work just fine
3. $75 [Gotoh Locking Tuners](https://www.amazon.com/Gotoh-Locking-Tuners-Magnun-Nickel/dp/B074N94N4G/) made in Japan and probably really nice.
	- This says even these locking vintage tuners are only 25.7g/pc 0.91oz which is just 0.06oz more than my set total
3. $75 There are some others that screw in from the tip
3. There are sevveral PRS and Mannmade ones too
3. These gotoh locking vintage 6 in line arent what I need because they arer 6 in lne BUT
	1. THey actually weigh the right amount: 5.65oz total ((my current one I calculate to be 5.4 so negligable diference))
3. $55 [Gotoh Locking](https://www.amazon.com/Gotoh-Locking-Tuners-Nickel-side/dp/B00EB11N46/) have good reviews, confirm the dimensions, and seem to match up with the weight of mine based on teh other data I've got.  They are also one day shipping.  [How to tune these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQbFbO03WsA)



Mod: Fretboard inlay Stickers 
https://fretlook.com/en/oaktree/

Mod: External Controls:
- Busuyi Bass has two pickups two sets of controls and two jacks.
- What if the guitar jack was stereo?  Plug in a mono cable get the bridge pickup.  Plug in a stereo cable get bridge l and neck r.  Then you can split them out and do whatever with them.  
- They could possibly have the coil split inside the guitar (an on off toggle) as well as a kill switch for volume convenience (also on off toggle)


Mod: Cool customizations already

# Youtubers #
And other players.

Theres a funny thing about most of these youtubers: They're so good at playing and dialing in tones that they can make even the crappiest gear sound good :) "I don't trust your review, you can plug into a potato and make it sound good."  It doesn't mean they arent trustworthy, they are trustworthy, but just get over the idea that if you get that gear you will sound like what you heard because while that is certainly true to a degree its just not that simple.  

About setting expectations:  on the one hand most of these players are so good they could make a potato sound good, otoh there are a lot of good reasons why they have gear that you wont have and dont need.  You do not need to buy the gear that all of them have to get the tones you want at first.  Getting lots of gear is fun but its an endgame quest, for now your job is three steps: 1.  Get the gear you need to get a good enough playyability and tone and feel and features to express your music in the venues you have access to (home apartment studio? friends basement? profeessional studio?  Small clubs?  Pizza restaurants?  Pupppet shows?) hint: you probably already have most of this 2. after you are makinig music and have found the things that you really need, then your job is find the gear that gets you to 90% of the tone and playability and feel and features that you want and need and then 3. as yyou make money over time and as you find gear that gets yyou 1% closer to the tones you want and need you can buy and integrate those things.

They wiill have gear that you dont have, they will have pre and post fx that you dont, they will have a nicer interface to their computer which in itself has better preamps, but thtey will be transparent about it and tell yyou that

One big thing to know is that for many/most amps, high gain amps or low gain amps, regardless of how high the gain is or how much natural drive or distortion the amps get, you need a tubescreamer (or somethign like it) to make it sound like most youtubers sound or like your faovrite records.  Sometimes the drivve will be on zero but its still valuable for tightening things up.  The point here is that its not optional if you want to get the most interesting tones out of your amp that sound like your favorite videos and recordings.  Even high gain amps like peavey 5150 and mesa boogie triple rectifier need a tubescreamer.  To be clear they dont need a tube screamer to be playyed and get great sounds, they just need a tube screamer to get their most popular signature sounds that you expect from them.  Sometimes the drive dial is on 0 on the tubescreamer but it still works.  Thinking more about this it evven applies to tiny ppractice amps.  THey can be brought to life by a pedal like this.  The point I'm making is less about what is possible with amps and more about what to expect.  If yyyou expecct that no matter what amp you buy you wiill need a tubescreamer to make it sound like it is 'supposed' to sound then you will be a happier player.  Consider it optional and you are likely to be repeatedly disappointed

Are you opposed to getting him involved in the choice in some way?  
Is there any way you can reveal it to him and ask him which one he wants?  If so I can get together some photos and then you can order the one he wants
I could say "Thinking of getting Cristi a new bass ... which one do you think is sexiest?"
Does he have a bass right now?

 Oct 2020 
I've been thinking more and more about evertune and it seems like a really good idea.
Ive also been thinking about the Dean Zelinsky guitars


* Ovation 
	* AND I just found a crazy awesome funky styled vintage Ovation electric guitar [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvkZ5-HWW6s).  There are some awesome SG style ones from the 70s but especially Breadwinner or ... The Eastwood Breadwinner is a clone of the funky one!  Viper Preacher ultra GT look awesome too!
	* PLUS the vintage 70s ones are just $600 or so!  Some are more like $1500.  Some of the Ultra GP or GT have carved maple tops like a Les Paul!  It looks like teh Eastwoods are licensed or something.  
	* The Small SG Jr looking blonde ash one is 8.8lbs though :(  
	* Some have Ebony Fretboards!  
	* The 2007 models are made in USA sell for $800 used have piezos and SD59s spruce top and mahogany back (belly carve too) and neck and look great


They just became one of my favorite guitar brands!
Off the top of my head:
Ovation
Dean Zelinsky
PRS X and S2 line
Dean Professional
US Masters EP RK
US Masters all
Reverend 


 March 2021 




Do I want to keep this PRS S2?
1. Sell the PRS and the PRS SE, keep the S2
1.5 Upgrade the pickups in the s2?  If so to what?
2. Get the eart guitar?  
3. Get a Dean Zelinsky guitar 
4. and get a PRS X
5. and something super solid with just wood finish (that NK guitar fits the bill) or the s2 singlecut satin or a satin gibson sg or the s2 vela satin (HOT!)
6. Also another guitar with an evertune bridge
7. and get one that has a super solid strong maple neck.
8. Also An S2 Mira or Starla taht weighs under 6lbs the s2 mccarty is frost blue and sometimes 6.5lbs
9. I love the idea of a super light telecaster.  Youcan't break that.



Other possible options for now sort of
1000. -----
3. $109 Lyxpro telecaster (Paulownia Weight not actually listed.  Guessing very low but thats a risk.  Super curious and would love for this to be a miracle and its so low risk but ... I dont really need it at all ... )
1. $1400 Fender Brad Paisley Worn Telecaster (reliably under 6lbs) (5lb8oz, "just over 5lb") "Light Tele?  You can't break that!"
2. $400 Steinberger $400 and probably super light (Update: Steinberger.com says they weigh 7lbs!?!  wtf!?!), Theres frost blue at zzsounds for $400, used synapse has a recessed plug,



Lightweight Options for Right Now
4. (BOUGHT) $310 Eart Blue beauty headless on Amazon
6. $1350 4.5lb PRS Mira X Bright Green. (DEFINITELY if the interaction messages feel and sound right)  
5. $1429 5.4lb PRS S2 Vela Green Metallic.  Cool seller confirmed the weight.  (yes but after or instead of the bright green one)



Mar 19 2021
As much as I want a beautiful impeccable gorgeous museum piece, thats legitimately NOT what I want.  I Would probably still want one if I hadn't already had one for a long time now (my Blue PRS!)
Instead I like the idea of those finishes, but then I have some concerns about scratching or denting them.  I dont want that baggage. If it hsas a nice top then I want it to have a big gash or defect in it already.  Otoh I like the idea of having just one body wood, natural satin finish.  I like the idea of having a T-60 like body wood and finish, or an EP-RK like that or a satin mahogany like some PRS or Gibsons or a satin finish alder or ash.  Most important is just that there are so damn many finishes that I want to have and look at that I cant possibly pick just one so that needs to be mostly out of the consideration it just has to be one I like the looks of and for that reason sometimes the more classic the better.
Want: Lightweight, LowBaggage, High Quality.   5.5lbs(5lbs8.0oz) or less, Obviously used or worn, Easy to sell, Easy to replace)
Ideally: Beautiful Growly tone, sings when strummed, 24.75" or 25", 1 Bridge Humbucker, Plug and clip system for swapping pickups

Bought the Eart and also bought the Boss GT001 from Sweetwater too.  This is feeling really right

- Somewhere in this video the beard talks about his friend calling him and saying that they just had a 5.5lb McCarty 594 come through the shop https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UccHG4xTI-U



























Sexy Guitars:
1. Amazing looking Ash blue black open grain look tele TE-90FLT Blue Blast
	2. 	Same look in a zemaitis V
1. PRS S2 McCarty.  This is right up my alley.  I feel great desire for this.  Probably with a high end pickup swap this would be even BETTER than a core for me personally.  I love the look and all of the features and it even has a SHORTER than Gibson scale length!!!
1. PRS CE "Those are total rock machines"
1. Sterling axis blue is beautiful and evh

"Remember: You can always add bass in post without adding significant noise. But any time you add treble EQ to anything, it will add noticeable hiss. Therefore, we are always better off with a quiet pickup that has the inherent high-end frequencies. You can add as much bass as you need with the amps' tone knobs or the mixer's EQ. You can always reduce treble without adding noise." B00RJIE944

On the clarity of 50s wiring in a Les Paul
- From [This youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd0nMtcwJS0&lc=UgyYDw8SyM9XFdjsnIJ4AaABAg)
"The thing that these humbucker guitars sound like a fat single coil is freaking amazing" "50s wiring. You can do it to your guitar and it will sound close to this regarding the openness/airiness."  "@André Borges  You really think that?"  "I’ve a 2007 R8  that sounded a bit muffled, so I swapped the Burstbuckers for a PAF replica and it did sound better. Afterwards it came to me the info about the 50sW and I tried it. It was a revelation. Even the resonance point, which allow the guitars to be controllably microphonic, have improved. I now have my dream guitar, which I pitted against a real 1957 Goldtop and it left nothing to be had tonewise... It really helps to bring those upper-mids/treble sparkle to life."  "A consequence of finally supplying the demand for genuine PAF clarity. Pickups made to the original specs plus pots that likely read in the 525K range if not higher (like many of the old Centralab pots used in the 1950s). The 50s wiring helps preserve treble when you roll down the volume pots too."

On wiring a strat like a tele
- From [This video from JayLeonardJ](https://youtu.be/AKWhoPPOrEE?t=262) he wires his strats with the middle position as a tele in between position!  Its brilliant!  It makes me want a lightweight HSS Strat, and 5 way switch: 1. Bridge Humbucker, 2 Bridge Single Coil, 3 Bridge Single and Middle, 4 Bridge and Neck, 5 Neck, maybe not though but at least this:  A lightweight HSS Strat, Interesting switches (maybe the blend from the video above), Trem King vibrato, A chunk out of the bottom for my knee, a 25"scale conversion neck, ...

Plotting out Pickups:
All of them can be easily swapped out for reviews:
1. Limelight came with bare black and should have Purple or Chrome (Purple is bad ass but the chrome really makes me happy) 
	1. purple super distortion with the purple neck its a pretty good combo
	1. Perhaps its too bright with the duncans?  Or maybe its just right and unique?
	1. If its too bright than the ToneZone/PAFPro that Paul Gilbert used would be great
	1. Also the breed set would be bad ass to have a guitar with just that or to have the set to pass around.   Actually its great but its for 25.5 Trem guitars 
	2. Maybe the Andy Timmons pickups?  or maybe the Steve Vai Evolution?
2. Mr Brownstone has bare black and it seems to me it should stay bare black.  Chrome would totally work but white wouldn't
	1. It seems like he might be a perfect match for the JB 59.
3. Billy Ocean came with chrome USA PRS pickups and will probably never NEED to be changed
	1. It would still be fun to try tons of pickups in there.
	1. I would want to remove the current wiring and replace it ... maybe even with a super simple wiring?  
	1. Maybe I would want to wire up a harness with full capability?  
	1. Maybe with the existing harness I could use it as it is by running some simple wires?
4. Blue Steel had chrome and now has white.  White or chrome would work just fine.  Black would work but would also be a bit washed out.

- Trembucker in regular guitar
- Amplitube amp models I could review them all and if I don’t get one once I can come back and test it out 6wks later or make a new account on another computer with another email or something
- Cheap lightweight update
