Made in Coppercube which is an interesting engine but ultimately not maintainable.  

It did provide some things that other engines dont (AI Characters, built in starting resources, great first party FPS tutorial), but it lacked some key features like any way to copy and paste between scenes at the time I felt like 

The biggest disadvantage is there is no community to speak of to go to for assistance or to see the solutions they have come up with.

I had fun making it and even playing it and have thought about re-creating it in a more maintainable engine.

* Alien 3 is a great game.  See my review in the amiga section but a game like this with unlimited ammo and lots of exploration in tight corridors even overhead view I think would be a ton of fun.

The creation of this game was originally inspired by a tutorial on noobtuts.com​​ which while fantastic, did not work with modern versions of unity (but I tried it this week and it works perfectly in Unity 5.0.0f4 which is still available for download) so while I licensed different art and made my own map I couldn't use the code from that tutorial for this game.  The development approach for the core gameplay is identical however.
