## Electric Solid Body Guitars ##
I'm not a player of electric hollow body guitars or acoustic guitars (not that I dont think they're cool or play them sometimes) so most of the following guitar deals are for electric solid body guitars.  Dont give me grief if theres a thinline tele in there from time to time.

1. $1100 [Kiesel Aries A6H 2018 Sunburst Satin](https://reverb.com/item/31882874-kiesel-kiesel-aries-a6h-2018-sunburst) So beautiful and classy.
2. $450 [Godin Detour](https://reverb.com/item/31216299-godin-detour) these are awesome solid-as-a-rock (I've played them) with a special super solid neck joint, canadian built, simple and straightforward, hardtail, Gibson scale, dual humbucker small strat style guitar at a great price.  Godins are special since they are budget guitars with top quality and solidity made in North America
3. $355 [Godin SD](https://reverb.com/item/25411812-used-godin-sd-solid-body-electric-guitar-blue-w-gig-bag-98146373) This is a cool canadian made guitar in decent condition, blue, gibson scale, solid neck joint, looks like nice birdseye maple neck, with an HSS Strat configuration but in a short scale.  Here's [another one](https://reverb.com/item/31685461-godin-sd-with-sperzel-locking-tuners-and-original-gig-bag) with a similar price.

Made in Canada.  Here's a [$430 black one with Duncans](https://reverb.com/item/32130873-godin-lg-black-w-seymour-duncan-pickups-and-case) and then here's a [$300 natural mahogany humbucker model](https://reverb.com/item/32278458-godin-lg-humbucker-2007-natural) and then this [$430 black humbucker model](https://reverb.com/item/32130873-godin-lg-black-w-seymour-duncan-pickups-and-case)

6. FGN Boundary Odyssey [$700 Transparent Blue Sunburst](https://reverb.com/item/32130873-godin-lg-black-w-seymour-duncan-pickups-and-case) This is a cool Hardtail HSS Strat made in Japan.

Heres an [$1185 CMG Ashlee that is a beautiful yellow flame](https://reverb.com/item/23462117-cmg-ashlee-2019-amber-high-flame) 
8. Reverend Sensai HB FM [$710 blueburst](https://reverb.com/item/31194992-reverend-sensei-hb-fm-electric-guitar-blue) This is an SG style guitar with some Les Paul aesthetics.
9. PRS SE Pauls Guitar [$1000 Aqua Beautiful](https://reverb.com/item/30267014-prs-pauls-guitar-aqua-blue) or [This one Aqua Beautiful for $1000](https://reverb.com/item/30245862-paul-reed-smith-se-paul-s-guitar-2019-aqua-blue) These are made in Korea or Indonesia and are fantastic and beautiful professional level instruments.  I love how the back and cutaway on this is black although I prefer the natural binding I still love this. I love how clean the pickups look and I love hardtails and wraparound bridges
10. PRS SE Custom 24 [$550 blue flame top](https://reverb.com/item/18356587-2013-paul-reed-smith-se-custom-24-electric-guitar-w-gig-bag) or this [$385 possibly santana not custom](https://reverb.com/item/32268047-paul-reed-smith-se-custom-24-early-2000-s-santana-model) or this [$445 Standard 24](https://reverb.com/item/30141317-paul-reed-smith-se-standard-24-2018) These are really beautiful guitars with a maple top and flame veneer.  More recent models have some different appointments.  They're often listed as Standard 24 or are very similar.
11. PRS SE Zach Myers [$525 Zach Myers Flame Blue](https://reverb.com/item/25988432-paul-reed-smith-se-zach-myers-2010-2012-royal-blue) This is a 3 humbucker single cut hardtail wraparound bridge guitar with four knobs and a pickup switch.  Its pretty and pretty cool.  This one is beautiful [$691 but so beautiful royal blue](https://reverb.com/item/21754403-prs-se-signature-zach-myers-royal-blue 
12. PRS SE 245 Singlecut [$550 beautiful blue](https://reverb.com/item/32059314-paul-reed-smith-se-245-whale-blue) masked binding around most of it, older models [like this $540](https://reverb.com/item/31374773-paul-reed-smith-se-245-2018-2019) dont have the masked binding. or [$388 Black SE Singlecut with EMG81/85 Zakk Wylde Set](https://reverb.com/item/32353672-paul-reed-smith-se-singlecut-upgraded-with-emg-81-85)
14. PRS SE Custom 22 Blue [$789 new Sapphire Blue](https://reverb.com/item/29702085-prs-se-custom-22-sapphire-w-bag) these have a trem and are so beautiful with masked binding made in Indonesia.  I love this [$879 new Custom 22 Burl Blue top](https://reverb.com/item/29478782-prs-se-custom-22-special-run-electric-guitar-burl-top-roasted-maple-neck-whale-blue-t14566) the masked binding is amazing on this being able to see all the way through the maple top and into the mahogany back.  I love the look plus the burl top is lovely. 
15. PRS S2 Series [$850 S2 Standard 22](https://reverb.com/item/32612529-paul-reed-smith-s2-standard-22-2017-frost-blue-metallic) These are high quality USA made instruments with some cost cutting from the Paul Reed Smith Core models.  I have a Mira from this series and its fantastic.  I love the metallic blue and PRS Tremolos are great.    [Heres a $1070 metallic blue S2 Mira](https://reverb.com/item/26537591-paul-reed-smith-s2-mira-2018-metallic-blue)  [$775 for a beautiful Satin Walnut finish Singlecut](https://reverb.com/item/32383926-paul-reed-smith-s2-singlecut-standard-satin-walnut-2016-2019) I love this finish so much.  I love how the grain shows and feels through the finish.  This is simple and solid and classy as hell imho. [$825 for a classic white singlecut with some dings](https://reverb.com/item/32361239-paul-reed-smith-s2-singlecut-standard-w-bird-inlays-2015-vintage-white) it is a bit weird that the serial number isnt on this one or is painted over or rubbed off so I can't wholeheartedly recommend this but for an educated buyer it might be perfect.  [$800 for singlecut in seafoam green or turquoise with Seymour Duncan pickup upgrades and a few dings and chips](https://reverb.com/item/18510479-prs-s2-singlecut-standard-2014-sea-foam-green) the pickups in these are great as is and are dynamic and not problematic, with that said duncans (JB/Jazz) are great too and the original pickups are included.  I love the classy looks of this guitar.  
16. PRS Core Series [$1350 Powder Blue Core Series Mira](https://reverb.com/item/26244397-paul-reed-smith-mira-in-powder-blue-2008) The quality on these is top notch and they are rumored to be super lightweight.  Some similarities to the SG design but with their own classy classic style.
17. Vintage V100 [$355 Tobacco Sunburst with an unconcerning chip at the bottom](https://reverb.com/item/31885451-vintage-v100mrtsb-icon-series-single-cut-distressed-tobacco-sunburst) These are amazing instruments and an amazing value.  Theyre highly regarded with great hardware (Wilkinson brand) and it would be hard to get an Epiphone with this quality.  
18. Vintage V6 [$399 Cream Strat V6](https://reverb.com/item/28914283-demo-vintage-reissued-series-v6-vintage-white-w-vintage-gig-bag)  These are amazing instruments and an amazing value.  Theyre highly regarded with great hardware (Wilkinson brand) and it would be hard to get an Squier with this quality.
19. ESP EC 1000 [$460 Black EC-1000 with EMGs and chips and scratches](https://reverb.com/item/30564565-ltd-ec-1000-deluxe) The ESP 1000 series are amazing instruments which are average weight but the appointments here are premium.  Tuners (Sperzel locking I believe), Premium pickups (EMGs or Seymour Duncans), They have beautiful bindings and aesthetics. Its not too hard to find these for $550-600 which is a good price. 
20. Hamer USA Series - This wasn't a series per se, but Hamer used to [handmake their guitars in the USA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wicSQKLVNs) Finding these for under $1000 is a great value on a legit top of the line no compromises professional axe.  [$950 for a Red flat top all mahogany P-90 LP DC Jr style axe with lots of little dings](https://reverb.com/item/29119780-hamer-usa-special-1993-red-with-p90-s) or you could get this [$1169 beautiful blue carved flame maple top with one ding](https://reverb.com/item/29764461-hamer-usa-studio-electric-guitar-1996-kool-blue-w-hard-case) I love when you can see the figured texture of the maple top through the binding on the side and in this case you can even if its the same color as the top.  I had one somewhat like this. [$990 for a red carved top studio with some chips](https://reverb.com/item/32601509-1996-hamer-studio-ohsc-usa) Great USA Hamers can be had for $1000-$1200 and are still a deal at this price as well and they are a great axe at almost any price.  I like their carved top (les paul double cut) style guitars more than their funky superstrat shapes, but those are also highly regarded.
21. Vintage VS6 (SG Style) [$336 black with some chips](https://reverb.com/item/31232372-vintage-vs6-2000s-gloss-black) or [$290 cherry with a bit of buckle rash](https://reverb.com/item/32359989-vintage-vs6-sg-copy) rumored to have graphite nuts too. $450 for these is a good typical price, so getting them for less is a bargain. 
22. Michael Kelly Strat Style (either 1960s series or burl 60 series) I love the 1960s Blue Jean Wash or the [$525 Blue Burl 60](https://reverb.com/item/23260727-michael-kelly-burl-60-ultra-electric-guitar-blue-burl-used-mint)  The burl 60s have a korina body which is rumored to be lightweight.  [$445 for a natural burl 60](https://reverb.com/item/23260728-michael-kelly-burl-60-ultra-electric-guitar-natural-burl-used-mint) or this [$388 for Blue flame 1960s with some cosmetic blems](https://reverb.com/item/7366796-michael-kelly-1960s-series-1963-guitar-flame-maple-blue-jean-wash-tremolo-blem) If a line on the front with slightly different shade and some nicks and a dot on the back (see description and photos) are ok with you then this is a serious bargain.  The 1960s models have a swamp ash body.  
23. Michael Kelly Patriot is a great and super underrated and undervalued Les Paul style guitar with high quality korean manufacturing.  [$239 Glossy Black](https://reverb.com/item/22156016-michael-kelly-patriot-standard-black) or this [$250 Grey flame](https://reverb.com/item/31795829-michael-kelly-patriot-standard) or this [$310 all grey with black binding](https://reverb.com/item/29270058-michael-kelly-patriot-magnum-metallic-grey)  or this [$338 Flame Orange](https://reverb.com/item/31971747-michael-kelly-patriot-flame-orange) or this [$385 beautiful blue denim with minor blems](https://reverb.com/item/7701998-michael-kelly-patriot-decree-electric-guitar-new-coral-blue-set-neck-blem)   
24. Michael Kelly Tele (aka 1950s series aka Burl 50 series aka 53db aka 1955) [$415 for a beautiful blue jean 1950s series with HSC](https://reverb.com/item/30355313-michael-kelly-1950-s-tele-2019-blue-jean-wash) or [$363 for a burl 50 blemish](https://reverb.com/item/23260724-michael-kelly-burl-50-ultra-electric-guitar-blue-burl-blemish-restock-used-mint) it says its a blemish restock and doesnt say what that means.  You could try to contact the seller or take a chance and count on their return policy (which seems flexible). Some of these are Ash and the burl 50 series are korina.  Or [$340 Beautiful Partial Eclipse finish](https://reverb.com/item/31900520-michael-kelly-53db-hh-telecaster-2019-partial-eclipse-w-gig-bag) this one is reportedly made of alder. or this [$338 Beautiful Partial Eclipse model](https://reverb.com/item/32623715-michael-kelly-guitars-53db-electric-guitar-pau-ferro-board-partial-eclipse) or this [$319 53DB flame tobacco burst aka Tigers eye](https://reverb.com/item/31602962-michael-kelly-53db-electric-guitar) some of these have dual humbuckers.  or this [$325 Dark Tigers Eye](https://reverb.com/item/18485559-michael-kelly-53db-electric-guitar-dark-tiger-s-eye-ebony-fingerboard-used-mint) 
25. Dean 79 series like [This 79 Cherry V MIK with Bill Lawrence and Seymour Duncan Pickup Upgrades](https://reverb.com/item/31845819-dean-v-79-with-upgrades-flame-maple-2002-cherry-sunburst)
26. US Masters [$560 for this US Masters Vector beautiful hardtail strat with finish wear](https://reverb.com/item/21224919-us-masters-vector-transparent-blue) these have amazing features.  A really comfortable special neck shape, special tight neck joint, us quality.  These often go for $1000 but can sometimes be found for less than 700 which is a bargain on a top quality USA guitar.
27. ESP 256/400/401 series [$315 Viper 256 with EMG-HZs and Hardshell case](https://reverb.com/item/27526518-esp-ltd-viper-256-with-emg-pick-ups-and-electronics-and-esp-case) or [$311 EC-400 Red beat up with EMG 81s](https://reverb.com/item/32233858-esp-ec-400-red) or [$360 for Goldtop with Seymour Duncancs, some finish cracks, and a hardshell case](https://reverb.com/item/32613307-esp-ltd-ec-400ac-gold) or [$369 for nice condition tobaccoburst](https://reverb.com/item/32627841-esp-ltd-ec-400-vf) or [$360 for Flame Top Tobaccoburst with duncans](https://reverb.com/item/32618674-esp-ltd-ec-400-vf)
