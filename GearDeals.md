## Electric Solid Body Guitars ##
I'm not a player of electric hollow body guitars or acoustic guitars (not that I dont think they're cool or play them sometimes) so most of the following guitar deals are for electric solid body guitars.  Dont give me grief if theres a thinline tele in there from time to time.

1. $1100 [Kiesel Aries A6H 2018 Sunburst Satin](https://reverb.com/item/31882874-kiesel-kiesel-aries-a6h-2018-sunburst) So beautiful and classy.
2. $450 [Godin Detour](https://reverb.com/item/31216299-godin-detour) these are awesome solid-as-a-rock (I've played them) with a special super solid neck joint, canadian built, simple and straightforward, hardtail, Gibson scale, dual humbucker small strat style guitar at a great price.  Godins are special since they are budget guitars with top quality and solidity made in North America
3. $355 [Godin SD](https://reverb.com/item/25411812-used-godin-sd-solid-body-electric-guitar-blue-w-gig-bag-98146373) This is a cool canadian made guitar in decent condition, blue, gibson scale, solid neck joint, looks like nice birdseye maple neck, with an HSS Strat configuration but in a short scale.
