### Single Button on Amiga ###
I feel kind of sad for fighting games on the Amiga.  I have found virtually no good ones.  Many people say IK+ and Barbarian and I can see that.  Others say Body Blows, but someone is going to have to show me why that one is even ok.  I had it on PC and enjoyed it for what it was worth.  Capital punishment horrible, SF2, ok, I watched a video that suggested that one of the SF2 games was pretty amazing, alpha maybe?  MK ok, MK2 ok, but without multiple buttons I dont know how to control any of them and its honestly sad for me.  I think multiple buttons is one of two things that held the amiga back from being modern past 1991 (when SNES made 6 (or at least many more than 2) buttons somewhat standard).  It doesnt seem at first like that big of a deal but when theres so much functionally that a dev wants to do with a game but the user has no discrete clear simple and reliable (works instantly every time) way of executing those commands ... #gametheory.


### Warren Robinett on Game Theory ###
There is a natural progression in the emergence of a new art form. Often there is an enabling technology that must first be invented and made to work. In the case of cinema, for example, this was the motion-picture camera, projector, and film. Then come the first works exploring the new medium. The pioneers are often clueless, from the point of view of later practitioners, about what you can do with the medium, and a great deal of experimentation occurs, with a few successes, and with some bizarre and interesting relics that soon disappear. If the public likes what they see, they continue to buy, and the medium has a chance to develop. The ideas that work give rise to genres, and all too quickly, the youthful efflorescence is over (Alas, that Spring should vanish with the Rose/ That Youth's Sweet-Scented Manuscript should close.) and the genres harden. Critics arise when there are enough works that the public needs help sorting out the good from the bad. And trying to analyze what separates the good from the bad naturally leads to a theory, or theories, about the medium. Throughout the progression outlined here, in a healthy and developing medium, there is a continuous competition among the practitioners making new works. The critics and theorists cannot get started without a body of works to winnow and analyze, and their work is meaningless without a stream of new works being created, presumably being informed (somewhat) by their efforts. The wolf keeps the caribou strong. The players, the designers, the critics, and the theorists are natural members of a healthy ecosystem.
This homespun theory of art-form emergence is based on what I have observed in the field of video games. (For a homespun art theory, there are no doubt theorists waiting, vulture-like, to claw out its eyes and pick its bones. But hey, vultures, I was there and you weren’t.) The enabling technology (computers and computer graphics) became cheap enough to reach consumers in the 1970s. A great many video games were created in the first ten years, and genres came to be recognized (shooters, racing games, sports sims, side-scrollers, etc.). Critics were born when the game magazines began rating various games (C+, A-, etc.). As far as I know, this book is the first to focus exclusively on the theory of video games. There is a set of questions that fall to the theorists to address, but before trotting out the Big Questions, let’s return briefly to the early days of the medium.

This is a book about video-game theory, and I think a reasonable person might well wonder why a theory is needed for video games. I’ll give my answer here. In the video-game ecosystem I described earlier, the ecological niches were player, designer, critic, and theorist. The roles of designers and players seem obvious -- designers design games and players play them -- but what are the jobs of the critics and theorists? I believe that the critic’s job is to ask “Which are the good games?” and the theorist’s job is to ask “Why?” From those basic questions, many new ones spring up:
What makes a good game? What are the desirable qualities? Fun? Realistic? Playable? Winnable? Responsive?
What are the elements of video games? By “elements” I mean such things as the game world, objects, autonomous creatures (“AI”s), other human players, goals, obstacles, weapons, tools, user-interfaces, controllers, and sounds. For comparison, some elements from which novels are built are: plot, character, description, and dialogue; and for poems: alliteration, meter, and rhyme. Some elements from which music is built are melody, harmony, rhythm, repetition, tempo, dynamics, and phrasing. Can we identify the essential and fundamental elements of video games?
What are the genres of video games? People seem to naturally want to group works into classes according to their similarities. What are those classes? These would be analogous to the genres we
find in music (classical, rock, jazz, country) and among novels (detective novels, romance novels, historical novels).

### What do little boys like ###
And little boys haven’t changed. (Not even the ones who are now 30 or 40.) They still like to blow up bad guys, fight scary monsters, and drive noisy, powerful vehicles.


# My Philosophy on Difficulty #
* Games that were fun in the eighties were partially fun because of the difficulty
	* Which creates a consequent reward and satisfaction and fulfillment in the process of improving your skill and eventually getting good at and possibly beating them or even ‘mastering’ them
	* And this difficulty evolved more or less directly from the video arcades which generally made more money if the game had just the right difficulty
	* It made its way into home games and difficult became the norm and the standard
	* And there was certainly some value to that since for a dedicated player a difficult game provided more play time for a dedicated player since they would have to play it many times to master it and make progress
	* Not to mention the satisfaction mentioned above
* But it didn’t have to be this way
	* For home games and conversions they did not have to be so difficult.  You had already paid the $40.  
	* I don’t mean that every game creator that made their game difficult in the eighties was wrong to do so, far from it since that also provided a perceived value for money that some players and reviewers required for credibility
	* I do believe most games would have benefited from a legitimate easy mode which had unlimited lives or continues or something like that
	* For many gamers given the amount of time or skill or entertainment-patience they had me included most games were unfortunately out of reach for them which meant that you would buy it and play it for a while and the difficulty was so high even on easy mode that it provided a barrier to entry that was too much to overcome
	* Especially if many of the tricks were used such as restarting the game after you died too many times.  
	* This stuff always boggled my mind and I felt it was a waste and a shame and I still do
* For these reasons I like the idea of games that provide much of the joy of the core gameplay of those games without the same difficulty level.
	* Games with fair difficulty meet a need I have had since the 80s
	* I’ve always wanted to experience the fun core gameplay of pac man but with a chance to make real progress through a story or scenario and get immersed the way I did with Super Mario Bro’s. 
	* I always wanted to be able to play Smash TV and Robotron without cheap deaths
	* Fundamentally I always wanted to be able to put unlimited quarters into the games I bought for my home
	* And I always wanted for them to be easy enough that I knew that with a just little reasonable amount of patience and practice and retries I could make legitimate progress
	* And I always wanted for my progress to be saved between play sessions somehow 
	* And I always wanted for me to be able to play games with confidence knowing that I wouldn’t get stuck on something impossible for me and making the game somewhat of a waste
	* And I always wanted to play games that I could see all of the content if I just gave it enough time
* What is my kind of hard
	* Having to retry to learn things about the game is great
	* Learning new things about how the enemies re act or how the bosses attack or how the levels are laid out is fine and great and fun
	* Learning and developing strategies for getting past groups of enemies is fun and rewarding 
	* Sometimes even learning where traps are located and what to do to avoid them (even the hard way) is ok if it doesn’t punish you by putting you too far back
* What’s too hard
	* Expecting you to upgrade your skills to progress in the game is too much
	* Punishing you by putting you far back is cheap
* Some of this can’t be Known or balanced 
	* True that there are infinite skill sets so you can’t hit it right for everyone 
	* I’m aiming at gamers who have experience playing games for a while but who haven’t beat a lot of games because they were too hard
	* And some games I’m aiming at gamers who have no experience
* Not for hardcore competitive gamers and that’s ok
	* This may mean that to beat it competitively you have to beat it under a certain time or with a certain accuracy
	* Or it may mean that competitive players won’t find much to keep them occupied 
	* It also may mean that for some people the games are not very interesting
