# Roguelikes #
What I want

Possible Games

not that excited about
* ClaDun (use PSP Emulator)
* Elona +
* Maybe I just want an RPG with Procedural Dungeons (like Diablo but thats a bit played out for me, Id love something in Middle Earth)
* Diablo 3 might just work actually

roguelikes
* Quickband is just to get to level 12 to kill saruman it can be beat in just a few hours.  This might be great for me regardless of whether it scratches the itch above.
* UMoria might work well.  Angband is too complicated.  both are much more hack and slash compared to nethack (thats a good thing) 

Other Possible Options
* I could make my own game that meets my particular needs using the TE4 engine here: https://te4.org/wiki/T4_Modules_Howto_Guide/Getting_Started It immediately lets you use your own custom module and character, I dont know if the custom module will let you use the same seed every time, or if it will let you keep inventory like resurrect the character or something ... maybe when the character dies they just go to the top of the dungeon?
* Someone at angband says "sharing the randart file has exactly the same effect" does that mean I can just replace the randart file every time?  
- I guess I could save scum from the beginning of the map?  sure and that might be fun but I would like to be able to go back up to the top to do some business at the store and then go back down into the dungeons.  This is not really what I want.
- Apparently pre 2018 there was a "use same randart set as last game" but it was removed.
- sometimes they call it permalevels
- Someone was saying they want an angband creator mode so they can make maps for competitions.

# Game Jams #

## Ludum Dare 47  ##

My Game
https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/populatio
Jims Game
https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/escape-velokitty


 Ludum Dare 47 Notable Games and notes:
* [Populatio](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/populatio) my game!  really proud.  This was inspired and didnt take that long.  I forgot to mention in the notes is that my git repo is in the zip with the game so they can walk through the whole history of its development.  
* [Mels Bells](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/mels-bells) This is an awesome rhythm game and with a few tweaks I think I would love it.  As is I beat it but it was super hard and I never felt any level of ownership of the skills required to beat the boss.  #inspiration
* [Energy Loop](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/energy-loop) there are loads of other puzzlescript games with source probably in each of the game jams.  This isnt inspiration but I would be interested to see how they made this.
* [Mousehard](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/mouseherd) really cool like the dreamcast game chu chu rocket about cats made in lšve and I might enjoy looking at this source.
* [Dante Slumbers](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/dante-slumbers) Totally pro.  This is nearly as polished as like an NES game and it looks and plays amazing.  the menus are great and its got a TON of character.  Code is on Github.  This person really knows their shit and are jam pros!  Also they have their own engine port or something on github called GLOV.js Examples: 
* [Magical Marissas Trouble through Time](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/magical-marissas-troubles-with-time) a fun ball tilter pinball type thing with clunky (but possibly fixable) physics and colliders and stuff)
* [DeedsLoop](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/deedzloop) made with catsoft game creator.  This had a really fun 3rd person controller with a cute player character.  unlimited doublejump and fun bouncy primatives and a colorful plasticy look and Id love to play a longer game in a fall guys like deal.
* [Infinite Rails](https://catinthedark.itch.io/infinite-rails) looks like C64 made in TIC80. No sound in Safari.  Only in chrome.   I won!  It was a clever first person rail puzzle that could have many levels if it wanted to be a bigger game.  I wonder how the levels were defined in lua?  Now It should have had keypresses instead of clicks or the clicks should have been better captured because it didnt always respond and for this game its frustrating to go around the track again because of that.
* [Murder Loop](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/murder-loop) this requires chrome on mac and has a funny quirk:  It starts with a screen of controls and I read them and they all make perfect sense so Id ont worry about them but then I start to move around and the mouse wont move so I cant aim or look and I look at the controls to see how to look and it says to move the mouse, so I spent 3 minutes looking into it pressing buttons and wandering around and then for no reason it starts working but then later I find out that the first line in teh controls is middle mouse to unlock the cursor, which blows my mind that it started off as LOCKED>  So weird :) not a big deal though.
	There are some wonderful game play innovations here: enemy heads turn into points which combine and then you kick that point block around and then it is what unlocks doors for different amounts of points.   The graphics are great.  The shooting is pretty good, its pretty bloody for a voxel game the blocks drip blood.  
* [Loopsed in space](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/loopsed-in-space) One really cool mechanic I like from this is that you have to buy even the most basic features like shooting a gun from your ship.  Check back on this one because I might have gotten trolled haha
* [Solar Edge](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/solar-edge) Java jar I tried opening it with terminal but then I just right click->open->open and it worked. I love the style of the tutorial "I know youre the boss but if it was on me I would build a metal refinery first"  Well my colony died.  I think its cool how theres a strategy or like survival game in here and I love the art style all around.
* [Ball Of Duty](https://lando.systems/games/ld45-ballofduty/)  Special Drops from a year ago or so wow this looks so damn good.  So much epic presentation here.
* [Phone Tree of Despair](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/phone-tree-of-despair) This one you have to actually call a US phone number and then you get stuck in a loop.  They actually have to pay per call haha (not laughing at them laughing at the audacity and awesomeness)
* [Square Time](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/square-time) a ghost of your movements follows you around a maze (far behind) and you have to collect certain things without getting hit by your ghost. 
* [Loop To learn](https://esbenkc.itch.io/loop-to-learn) Best retro aesthetic so far #underrated and its about AI Training but unfortunately it is pretty broken after the first level.  Heres to hoping the author fixes it. #underrated
* [Abide the Loop](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/abide-the-loop)  Its a rhythm game so I really want to like it.  I cant figure out how to start it though. I press the button and theres no count in or anything and you just die after 3 beats.  Also its got the problem with the spacebar moving the screen.  
* [Oddpum](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/oddpum) Whoa this is a good game Jim beat this on his youtube video and its really cool.  It scared me and stressed me out though because I thought what if I make a mistake on a previous player that I cant fix without restarting.  Turns out you can travel between loops from teh escape menu which would partially solve that!       
* [Stuck In A Tutorial](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/stuck-in-a-tutorial) Wow this is cool you are in a tutorial loop but there might be a way out of it you'll have to figure that out
* [Get Process and Feed Food](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/get-process-and-feed-food-bad-buttons-game) a buttons game where you click buttons and move your button around :)  This isnt great and I couldnt figure it out.
* [loop-loop-loop](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/loop-loop-loop) This one is a cool VVVVVV like platformer with the whole world in a big segmented sphere.  Its a perfect jam game and since Death transition is a bit jarring, just a few tweaks and the fleshing out of more levels (other world shapes, more gradual difficulty transition) its a super solid full game title! 
* [Asteroid Loop](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/asteroid-loop) this is a wonderful asteroids clone but with a twist of being stuck to an expandable loop in the middle which I think actually fits the theme perfectly and better than others because you are legitimately stuck and disadvantaged by this loop.  The scripts are up but the whole project isnt yet but I wonder if he or she could be persuaded?
* [Giraffe Roller](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/giraffe-roller) holy shit they made a timelapse of the whole development process!!!
* [Word Garden](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/word-garden) timelapse!  Also apparently a huge memory leak.  I never got it working though anyway
* [Hyper Loop Runner](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/hyper-loop-runner) This has great graphics kind of like Fzero super fx chip scaling!  the windows java jar runs perfectly on Mac (well the opening sccreen text is a bit funny).  I loved teh controls.  Its such a cool concept you have to hit the blue side of the rift.
* [Orb Chamber](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/orb-chamber-delta) wow this was so good it was metroid vania in a big room and i won!  I got a screenshot
* [Quotes](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/quotes) I really liked this only wish they moved faster.
* [Bullet of Sysiphus](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/the-bullet-of-sisyphus) IN this game you battle a beast who is far too powerful for you but every time he kills you the battle starts over and his life recharges and you go again but this time your ghost does the same damage it did before plus you get to do as much damage as you can.  After a while with enough combined firepower he goes down.

Mechanics:
The Way Back had a great mechanic but Id like to expand upon it: You get 60 seconds to make progress and from every checkpoint progress can be made to get to the next checkpoint.  kind of like VVVVVV but it can be a big set of screens as long as you can do the job in 60s.
In Station 8 every time you die you keep everything youve collected on the level so you still have to find everything and get to it once but you dont have to do it all over and over, but you do have to do the hard parts over and over to beat it and you have to understand the map well enough to find everything and you will be trying to get to each piece several times and you will die a lot (even running out of ammo kills you) so you will have to do sections several times and this is a nice advantage.
In Eternal Run it gave me the idea to only allow ammo refills for weapon a when weapon b is equipped and only allow life refills when no weapon is equipped
Paradox Planet inspired me to the idea of a certain number of enemies which respawn after a certain time but makign them unique and hte best strategy is killing them intentionally so they dont all attack at once because if they do you die.  so kill one then run for a bit before you kill the next or when they all wake up they will be awake all at once
IN quotes you assemble quotes by going in the right order and then going back to your lander if you get the order wrong then you try again.  I really liked this
In Bullet of Sysiphus every time you die the fight starts over with the enemy doing the same attack patterns but this time yoru ghost is doing their damage too.

 Most interesting to build upon
* [Infinite Pinball](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/infinite-pinball) The code for this game Unity Project) is [on github](https://github.com/nickbarrash/ld47-infinite-pinball) This is the closest Ive felt to rollerball since rollerball and I loved the feeling.  #inspiration
* [Track Day](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/track-day) an amazing racing game with a super fun control mechanic.  #inspiration.  Unity Project Code is available. I ended up loading this in Unity and the unity project is actually super clear and has some great tricks.  I learned a ton in just 30min or so and helped the dev get skidmarks working on mac.
* [Loop Invader](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/loop-invader-1) WOW Top Notch Vector graphics shooting mechanics and responsiveness and everything about the shooting is something I want in my games.  What a winner!  Probably made in Haxe which makes it even more interesting.
* [Quetzalcoatl](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/aztec-ride) Super immersive into the art style of the pixel-aztecs.  The gameplay is fun and the sprite and level rotation is out of this world.  For a Jam game this is an 11.  First I got a 1009.  Someone said this could be a mobile game as is and I totally agree.  change virtually nothing.  2280.  The code is on github.  Wow it looks like its a Unity game!?!  The sound is immersive but also funny when the lemmings pop out
* [Vibe Rider](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/vibe-rider) The visual Aesthetic here is top notch low poly I love it so much. I dont know how the gameplay sticks to that track.  it so cool! 
* [Breakaway](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/breakaway) This is like gauntlet or something.  I love the level goals. I love the clever gameplay mechanic.  I love the scale and fighting speed.  It looks like Safari Mac has no sound which is true for about half of HTML5 games I've been playing.   Feedback: 1. Show some graphical idnication of damage (like little element particles fly off) when the loop is getting hit by its vulnerable element and show an indication of not being damaged otherwise (like a shiny shine).  2. Show on the HUD what weapon beats what somehow (or at least for the one you have equipped) 3. Show which weapon you have equipped on the hud.  4. Show an indication of when you can switch to that weapon like a little blip with a shaded circle radius around the base.   Wow I couldnt stop playing and I beat it.  What a blast.  I got through all four layers of the loop that I was stuck in.    #underrated.  
* [Round Out](https://github.com/foolmoron/RoundOut) A cool unity game that works perfectly on Mobile (better than on desktop actually) and has a cool looping mechanic to make points I got 101.59s and 9842 score with 900 top star.  Next time i got 15467 in 25.6s with 1150 top star!  Its got a great 2D Glowy   80s look that i love.
* [Press The Buttons](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/press-the-buttons) a great puzzle with boxes and switches and doors and keypads that would make a really cool simple VR escape the room game.
* [Super Loop Racer](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/super-loop-racer) I cant believe how good this whole game looks its like its right out of TRON or the 80s even with reflections.  the gameplay stinks bad, but it looks freaking incredible.
* [Cursed Temple](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/cursed-temple) Looks modern like hollow knight but with a time loop mechanic.  With a shallow difficulty curve I could play hours and hours of htis.  I dont want it to be too hard but just a little bit hard for a long time, bosses can be hard thats ok!  Maybe I could make the game I long for here?
* [Dank Dungeon](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/dank-dungeon) Wow I LOVE The controls here!  wasd to move and cursors to attack in that cardinal.  Its perfect and makes you have to use strategy you cant just hold that direction but have to time it right too.  Animation and Sound are betw Atari and C64 and work great.  Its really fun and I would love to see a full adventure RPG like this  Collision is a bit off like I dont think it should include the players head.  This could be made into a deep dungeon crawler roguelike like I've been thinking about and I would possibly have loads of fun doing it!  Update: this is a java game in just 405Kb thats incredible!  I tried it again and had way more fun and got to the second level!
* [The Way Back Platform Game](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/the-way-back) this is really cool 
* [Endless Night](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/endless-night) this could be a dual stick shooter almost as is I love the graphics style and lighting and everything
* [Station 8](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/station-8) I loved the trees and graphics here, and it has all of the basics of a simple low poly fps tank game.  I really liked its simplicity
* [Eternal Run](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/eternal-run-1) this had a great mechanic of on one awesome level getting through as many loops as you can with more enemies on the level every time.  pretty awesome.  The graphics and controls in this are PERFECT FPS its amazing
* [Schlooper](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/shlooper) Cool looking platform shooter in Unity

How did they do this?
* [Loop Room](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/loop-room) Unity source available for this something like robotron single screen but loopign on edges experience.
* [Aeternum](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/aeternum) I might like to see how they pulled off an endless runner like this in Unity
* [Super Loop Racer](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/super-loop-racer) want to see how they did this in Unity
* [Circuitus Infinitus](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/circuitus-infinitus) This is like an amazing level editor that I wonder if the same thing could be used in the future for other games?
* [Mortal Coil](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/the-mortal-coil) Godot engine really nice pixel art with lots of UI
* [Upventure](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/upventure) a platformer rotating around a building
* [While True](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/whiletrue) used Wave Function Collapse to generate the levels!

 Big winners
* [Beyond Death](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/beyond-death) Jam not Compo.  goddamnit (that is my anger when comparing my art skills to this team).  Just look at those screenshots.  Oh damnit the game is fun too and super clever and with tons of character.  damnit!!  :)  Its got this really funny puzzle mechanic that you have to experience it to believe it.  Amazing lighting and camera movement and presentation too.  Feedback: Could use a smoother camera follow up and down stairs.  Character animation is fantastic. voxel environment maybe the coolest adn most detailed pixel-art-like I've seen.  No source unfortunately for me.  OMG after a lot fo deaths the music changes to be more grim and theres blood everywhere lol.  The 3D is amazing for HTML5.  Totally console like with only tiny framerate lag.  I wonder what happens if you beat it without dying ... nvm I dont think thats possible.  no really :)
* [The Sysiphean Man](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/the-clockwork-men) this one is a masterpiece of presentation with cute pixely old guy sprite and a great time loop recording mechanic.  I wonder if the music really fits in this compo though.
* [Cursed Temple](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/cursed-temple) Looks modern like hollow knight but with a time loop mechanic.  With a shallow difficulty curve I could play hours and hours of htis.  I dont want it to be too hard but just a little bit hard for a long time, bosses can be hard thats ok!
* [Loopin](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/loopin-a-c64-action-puzzle-game) this is an actual C64 game made in C64 studio with c64 studio source code!
* [Afterimage](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/afterimage) This contains one of the coolest mechanics Ive ever heard of.  You try to beat a simple platforming level, but to do that you will end up accidentally hitting a trap and dying, when you come back then you can double jump but when you do that the trap falls in wait for another player. And it keeps track of who left what trap where!  Made in Lšve!
* [Robot Fight](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/robot-fight) super hard to believe this is a one man job (I have no actual doubts its just totally amazing).  Its a whole robot programming sim with cute pixel graphics and narrators and a story and huge human characters and lore.  wow.  Runs great in safari on the mac.  Really cool sort of chiptune NES or TG16 music going on too.  OMG There are even upgrades and unlockable robot technologies OMG.  And then you get to retry every level until you beat it (perfect) , plus its not just programming like "here are your commands" but actually "here are some of your commands and they are constantly changing and you have to pick them up at the right times"  and omg its got a sense of humor: "Wow congratulations on making so far in this unrigged competition" lol  #underrated  I beat the first two and moved on but boy is it good.  
* [Repeater](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/repeater) my mouth is hanging open.  this is one of the coolest smoothest experiences I've had in the compo and one that most perfectly captures the theme and is super fun to play and thrilling when you figure out what to do because its so damn mysterious.  YOu dont know why and it doesnt matter but you are filled with awe and wonder since now you dont know around what corner will be another inexplicable mystery.  Plus the aesthetic is so appealing and its just fun to run and jump like this.  could this ever be a full game and then some.  I imagine like metroid many different tileset environments and each level is like this whole game where it starts out seeming pretty straightforward but loops, and then you finally find an exit, but perhaps you have to go through the loop a number of times for some lighting to change and then certain other triggers happen.  Wow I love the style here.  Also gamepads work on this game even in html 5!  (well they are advertised to ... lets find out! yup it sure does (at least on windows))  Note: On mac this doesnt run in Safari (it doesnt finish loading - usually that means theres a compression problem and I think if you search for that you'll find several solutions).  For feedback I'd say some tweaking to make the player more like metroid, and make the enemies knock back when hit (they just kept coming which meant you had to use a retreating strategy of sorts) Tips: use a gamepad if possible. Keep enemies just off the edge of the screen. first stand and shoot fast, if you dont see sparks (which indicates youre hitting something) jump and shoot. When going up dont try to shoot them lure them to the side and juke to the other side. When going up dont jump out of the hole (you'll get hit lots) without jumping as high as you can on the side to see whats up there and lure them down. keep trying and look for things to change and you'll win eventually!  About the spoiler: My spoiler is so vague that you will have to try it several times to even see what it means but if you have figured out the core mechanic and you are stuck then this might help and you'll probably understand what I'm talking about here.  SPOILER ALERT If anyone wants a hint heres a real vague hint: right left (change) right (change), up left up, right (a bit) left (change) right and down
* [Snaketroidvania](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/snaketroidvania) hey this has a timelapse too!  Holy crap this is a 5 star game.  Presentaiton is #1 Concept is #1 controls are #1 I love how fluid the added controls are like pushing forward to pause is perfect.  For feedback ideally there should be a separate button to switch directions since in this case its backwards which ever way the front of your snake is going and that means theres never a button for that function theres always a calculation in the brain which is confusing.
* [Mobius Station](https:/./ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/mobius-station) It sso cool that you walk one way and it flips upside down.  One amazing thing about Pico8 is it recognized my gamepad after it started up!  ITs such a great concept of moving things around in advance and then speed moving things when you press the button.  It means its kind of chill but hten thrilling.  I love that mechanic.  I got a really high score over 200 deliveries and had a blast and almost finished hte last one too!
* [Electron The Electrical Engineer](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/electron-the-electrical-engineer) This is one of the best clearest and most innovative puzzle games Ive seen.  Its wonderful.  Its not too intense and its devilshly difficult - I couldnt even get past level 5!  I'm goign to try again though.  Wow it even remembers your progress game to game!!  Its so good!!!  I got to level 13 now!  I feel like the teleporter mechanic changes the logic of the game and while it def adds difficulty it removes all of the 2d planning I was doing and makes it harder not in a comfortable logical way.  I was just getting comfortable.  Its not wrong but I would have preferred a mode and some legs and longevity without any teleporter and maybe the teleporter is just for hard mode levels or something.  #highjamgameexpectations  You know what else is great about this game?  How to make the maps.  ALl the author has to do is draw one out that works including obstacles and then erase the path and leave a few of the path pieces intact ...

 Now that the jam is over which could I learn something from the code
* [Circline](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/circleline) a beautiful looking super clean low poly train game in Unity, and [Fort Loop](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/fort-loop) looks like its got some platforming and combat mechanics in Heaps and Haxe by the person who made lED, and [Ribbon](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/ribbon) which is a beautiful game which takes place entirely on the side of a ribbon and I have no idea how they did that but made in unity and [Recursive Arena](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/recurcive-arena) where the graphics are simple but the loop based arena platformer is awesome and super clever made in unity and amazing presentation and tutorial.

Mac Catalina is picky so on almost every mac game I've played today I've had to:
1. Type `chmod +x <gamename>.app/Contents/MacOS/*` 
2. then do the standard gatekeeper workaround: Right click->Open->Cancel->RightCLick->Open->Open




# Dont own but might want to #
1. Red Faction: Guerrilla - "Bringing destructibility and absolute fun"  "Being able to put explosives in one part of a building and watch it crumble because of your expert placement is more fun than you know"  does that guy have an ostrich?  
2. Uncharted 2 through 4 - I'm pretty sure I would love these to death.  I sure loved the first one.  


# Doom #
to play GZDoom with wads:
Or apparently you can drag and drop if the doom2.wad and doom.wad are in the same folder as the gzdoom


### Options ###
1. Right click gzdoom.exe and create shortcut
2. Right click the shortcut and hit properties
3. in the target field add: `-iwad DOOM2.wad -file Valiant.wad -savedir Valiant`

* Or make a .bat file with the same command
* Optionally add +logfile ValiantLog.txt
* If you dont have doom.wad or doom2.wad then use [FreeDoom](https://freedoom.github.io/)

### In game console commands ###
1. noclip nomonsters notarget on off
2. maplist
3. map map01
4. fly
5. give ammo
6. regenhealth on

### Configuring GZDoom ###
I had to do some substantial configuration to get my DS4 controller which works with every game on mac wirelessly to work even wired with GZDoom.  It didnt work wirelessly at all.  I had to set all of the button settings in the config to figure out what buttons were what but then some I had to set manually (specifically the fire button) in the gzdoom.ini file because strangely they didnt all reflect in the in game configuration GUI.  In the configure controller I had to set axis 1 to strafing, axis 2 to moving forward, axis 3 to turning, and axis 4 to looking up down and set the overall sensitivity on that one to 0. and invert it.  


## Doom Wads ##
1. Valiant - wow this is wonderful.  The level design is great and had many moments of scary stuff jumping out at me when I entered a new room or flipped a switch.  The enemies they throw at you are hard but not too hard (I'm playing on difficulty 3/5) and the level was really interestingly laid out with lots of secrets that made me feel clever for finding them.  I just beat level one and it took me about 15 minutes doing it leisurely but I'm sure it actually took more due to save states. Update 10/29/2019
 I just beat level 7 The Manchubian Candidate and all of the levels were really good.  It ended with some cool text exposition and then just kind of puts you in the menu which I think means I should start the next campaign in this wad.  They're all really good the way I play which is to be a bit careful and use lots of save states but I feel like I would have to be a lot better at the game to get anywhere on my first life.  Wow level 2.2 probably took me 2h (the game said 45 min but I had to start over many many times).  It is a puzzle just to try to survive the hordes and its very fun all along.  Level 2.3 took me 1:53 according to the game. In real world time looking at svae states ... 3h15m wow.  I'm proud of myself though.  I am having some doubts that I will be able to beat later levels at all if they get harder (which given that I'm only 1/4 through they surely will get harder).   Finished Level 9: Implosion.  really cool level.

## Marathon ##
- A competitor for Mac was Marathon [modern version recently updated](https://alephone.lhowon.org/) by Bungie and I would probably have a blast playing it 

# Crossplay VR #

6. Trackmania Turbo - this sounds like too much fun!!!
1. No Mans Sky comes out on VR for all platforms cross-play this Wednesday.  Its an enormous space sim where you can explore a whole galaxy. https://www.roadtovr.com/no-mans-sky-vr-psvr-announcement/ but its probably super complicated
2. Star Trek Bridge Crew (I own this now but have only played it once and didnt get anywhere
3. Rec Room, remember that time we played a quest or mission or whatever?  I can't say my performance held any water but it was a cool adventure and I would totally do that again.  Plus we could rock the battle royale feature that all the teenagers are playing these days.  They will totally snipe us from 200 miles the first few times we play but we might be able to figure out ways to hadoken the hell out of them.
4. Eve Valkyrie - Cross Platform Space Battle Sim
5. Sports Bar VR - Like Rec Room but more realistic looking
8. VRChat (Is this PSVR?)
9. Eagle Flight
10. Werewolves Within


## Other Multiplayer ##
1. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes
I think with Big Screen sharing enabled this might work.  Probably thats too much for the computer to handle though.

In other news I bought Skyrim VR (haven't played yet) and I just beat a game called Bloodstained Something or other of the Night which was made by the same guy who made Castlevania Symphony of the Night and it was really cool and I might play it again.

# Notes from around Christmas 2018 and January 2019
- Strider (NES) Jan 6 2019 - finished in under 15min using this speed run approach:
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HU3H_N4C14
	- It was really fun to do it this way and it made me feel good.


- Zelda II - The Adventure of Link - In 1990 when I was 12 I rented an NES for the first time in Park City Utah with two games: This and Mario 2. I got somewhere in Mario 2, but in this game I really didn't get that far.  I rented it later on too and got further because some of my friends had given me clues in the intervening months.  I remember getting to the horse head boss probably once maybe twice (I might have done that on someone else save file tbh) I got through the southwest cavern without the candle once or twice (it was very hard).  I would have got the candle but was so confused and overwhelmed I couldn't for the life of me figure out how!?!  I remember getting the jump but I don't think I could even figure out how to use it without help from friends (even with the manual!). Maybe I did figure that out but I remember it being very hard.  I also remember getting to the high wall and not knowing "am I going the right way and just don't have the right skills, or is there another way that I could go right now that I have all the skills???)  I also didnt understand the RPG elements at all so I was never powerful whatsoever even though I remember powering up a bit. I didnt understand that those elements were continued between games.  I remember seeing "I am Error" and legitimately thinking that my copy of the game was broken and had a serious programming or hardware glitch and thats why I couldn't get any further!  That made me feel better about not being able to get anywhere (for a while at least)  I remember thinking the little cave in the northeast with one enemy was really hard!?! 

	-  To be fair to John 1990 this was all very new to me.  We had an Atari so I had played some of that, but I was never that kid who sat in front of it for hours playing over and over, and we didn't really have many games you could do that with anyway ( I had never heard of adventure, and I my parents had bought Mario bros for Atari (not super) and I was real proud but I never got to spend all that much time with it because someone had stolen it out of my pencil box soon after).  I also had an interesting attitude about arcade style games: It seemed like if I had played pac man for a while then that was good enough because there weren't any new skills to learn  (that I could identify with my 12yo mind)  or levels or worlds to see just move around and dodge things.     I got pretty into Midnight Magic pinball though.  We had a C64 but the games on that were really different and I hadn't really dug deeply into them.  I hadn't played many arcade games either.  And regardless of all this gaming experience: all of my gaming had been with a n Atari joystick.  

	- Fundamentally there were a few things that were genuinely new to me: 1. Using a flat controller to try to deftly maneuver the character around the screen:  I didn't have an NES until probably Christmas 1992 and didn't buy this game until I was an adult.  At friends houses I had played Mario and duck hunt and elevator action, ghosts and goblins, wizards and warriors, and maybe one or two other games on NES that I don't remember (My friend Byron DID have ROB the robot but I remember he didn't want to set it up so I saw it and touched it but never got to see it in action), but if you counted up the controller time I had had by this point across all of those games (all at other peoples houses) it probably totaled to around 1 hour.  2 would have been pushing it. Probably the closest I had come to the platforming in Zelda 2 that I had spent any time with was Pitfall (and at the time I found maneuvering to the eyeballs of the alligators so hard it was scary to even try to do it!) and the precision, dexterity, multitasking, button manipulation, etc. required in Zelda 2 is light years beyond pitfall so my basic controller/platforming skills were vastly out of their depth.  2. I had never really been so over my head before.  At anything.  It was frustrating and confusing, and I didn't have enough information about what I was supposed to be doing for me to figure it out and probably my biggest problem was I really had no coping skills for dealing with my frustration.  I didnt know when to give up and say I wasn't good enough at it or that I couldn't figure it out, or when to keep going back to the same places over and over to see if I could find the one little thing I was missing.  I didnt know how much backtracking might be required (I wasn't familiar with backtracking at all really so I thought it must be the wrong way).  I had heard about some games requiring you to make maps, but even to my 12 year old mind that seemed like ancient technology that shouldn't be required in this modern era.  I couldn't fathom having to take notes or make a map for myself on paper (even though that would have solved most of my problems) and because of this misunderstanding about what kind of involvement was required and what should be handed to me on a silver platter even later when I went to play some old text adventures I hesitated making maps and suffered as a result) As a result of all this I didnt spend enough time with it to get good at it or to figure out what to do.  I had no one to talk about it with. I could talk to my friends days or weeks later around the lunch table and ask around.  I didnt understand that magazines were in many cases so important, and I didn't know which one to get anyway, not to mention I always felt like even if I got some magazine there would be something key missing that was in a previous issue but I wouldn't know that and the fear of that made me mostly ignore those magazines for tips and tricks (I loved magazines but mostly to get me excited about getting other new games!).  I played with my sister as much as I could but she was 3 years younger and I couldn't figure out any of it so we were both in the dark. 
	- 	 If I had an NES and the game, had more time to beat my head against a wall, and had friends with whom I could talk about where the candle was and what secrets we had all found, or if I had Nintendo power, I might have been ok.  Or if I had eased in with some other games that were more similar, or if I had better platforming skills, ... I have no idea how I could have gotten to horsehaead and I wonder if I just invented that or saw it in a magazine (I did have a magazine with a walkthrough but I was so young and dumb that I didnt put it all together and use it to play the game!  I also had some kind of snobby attitude about it like I *should* be able to beat it without any hints from any magazine.  Little did I know...  I know I made it to that palace and I spent many hours trying to beat it but I never did.    When I rented it back then it was back in the day when they rented out the manual with the game.  I remember poring over that manual so long I might have spent more time with it than I did with the game (since I was pretty frustrated since I couldn't get anywhere with it!)   
	- Now none of this mattered to my heart because even though I had very little time with the controller and sucked big time at friends houses I was drawn deep into the game worlds and so heavily hooked from the first time I played Super Mario. So when I finally got to rent my OWN NES I was so excited that its impossible to describe or even feel some magic like that anymore.

	- In 1999 when I went back to Utah for the summer I started playing it again believing I could beat it on my own.  I got further than I ever did as a kid: I beat the first palace but thats about it.  I don think I got the hammer without tips from my friend.  I played the first part on my own, the second part with tips, and the rest I played it with Charles Orians who when I complained about how impossible it is encouraged me and thought I could beat it.  I did but for much of it (especially the end) I used the Game Genie and I still didn't know what was going on, he helped me solve all of the puzzles and figure out where to go and what to do (since even at that point as an adult I would have had no idea nor would have been able to figure it out on my own).  I had beaten all of the 2d Mario games by that point so I had some platforming chops but the intricate combat was still difficult for me and he beat some of the hardest parts.    It was really nice of him to play it with me and walk me through it and super fun to play with him.  

	- This time around I have a digital map with labels on it for where everything is, I have Mike Matei's stream recording plus several speed runs on youtube, and most importantly I have almost 30 years of experience programmed into my hands of playing platform games on a controller and now its really fun!  Having seen some people do it all pretty quickly and seen the moves they make and the paths they take and I feel much more of a command over the game. I bet its taken me 8 hours so far but I feel like I could play this all again in half the time.  I remember in 1999 getting completely lost in the palaces and now even though I haven't looked at maps, they aren't too bad.  I guess my brain is better at doing the job of mapping these things now for some reason.


- Rygar (NES) Dec 5 2018 - This is simply a fantastic game.   - play more

- Strider (Genesis) Nov 15 2018 - This was fun.  Short when you play it with rewind.  It took me maybe 90 min on and off.collision was weird in parts but generally pretty good.  The freedom of movement in this game was unmatched at the time I remember it well.  It was so much fun just jumping and swinging and launching and flipping.  With that said the levels sometimes (a handful of times) required you to know just what to do or when to jump or you would fall into ap it and die.  Theres not complete control mid air so you have to make sideways jumps just right.  Very fun though with cool enemies and bosses (my favorite is the sickle snake)

- TMNT The Hyperstone Heist (Genesis) Nov 15 2018 - This is a great fun game! I played with rewind but didnt' have to use it THAT much and I believe I could beat it in a few hours without.  I played the SNES game Turtles in Time and while I can see that it is a hair 'better' I enjoyed this game better!  I have nothing against the SNES game.  This one feels more like I want it to feel though, namely: Like TMNT The Arcade Game.  The SNES one doesn't feel authentic because of the story and the characters.   It doesn't feel canon imho.  It never did to me which is probably why I never fell in love with it even in the arcade.  It felt fake, cheap, like a stretch.  As a game I can see its qualities but as a TMNT game I preferred this one and had more fun with it.  One thing really bugged me about this: Collision Detection on some of the traps.  The sharp bamboo that came out of the floor had an enormous surrounding box (probably a huge rectangle for simplicity) that made it difficult and unreasonable to avoid and the huge balls that come bouncing around didnt bounce high enough to have a good way to clear them (you could time it and run under them though).  Otherwise all of the enemies even the bosses were pretty good.  I think they should have had fewer of the white foot clan who block constantly because they just slowed the action down too much. Then again maybe theres an easy way to beat them super quick that I didnt figure out.  Overall I loved it.  Most of all I LOVED the music.  Especially the song at the end when you win!  Its Pizza Power from the Out of our Shells tour!!! So cool!!! Would play again a thousand times!  In fact this is the game I would have loved to have on the Genesis back in the day. If I were buying one then for myself I would get this and Strider.  It makes me want to get one now and those two games!  It took me 59:18 sec according to the game clock.


- Wolfchild (Sega Master System) (Oct 11 2018) - This is a slow paced game but its fair and pretty fun.  
- Wolfchild (Genesis) (Oct 11 2018) - Compared to the Master System this has rudimentary cutscenes, Parallax scrolling, same levels, enemies are more sophisticated and fun, the whole game feels alive in comparison, the boss took way too many hits imho.  Its fun!  I tried level 1 again without rewind with easy mode and 6 lives options and I beat it easily on two lives.  now its cool because when you die on the boss you start right before the boss.  its also interesting that shooting as the wolfchild seems to be way worse (because its slow) on the bosses than punching reallhy fast from up close.  
	- Oh weired it doesnt refill your life when you start level 2!?!  When you get the wolf powerup you get full life so its ok.  
	- This is a way better game than Sega Master System
	- (SG17) Beat the game on Nov 5



- Rastan (Sega Master System) (Oct 11 2018) - This isn't very good tbh.  I thought I would like it but its totally stale and stiff, the controls are ok, but the enemies are totally cheap which makes it not fun.  I played a level or two and beat a boss (which was lifeless and uninspired) and you cant beat anything without taking hits.  Makes it not fun.

- The Addams Family (TurboCD Oct 10 2018) - This is a shitty game. The controls are slippery stiff and slow, the enemy AI is almost non existant, the game structure is illogical and confusing, the whole premise of being the familys lawyer is absurd, the voice acting is probably just one or two actors, theres virtually nothing related to the movie, virtually none of the game could be beat without taking damage.  No continues.  I beat it with just TONS of rewind.  

- Batman Returns (Game Gear) - Really cool game but sticky rope controls.  The branching paths on every level make for a ton of replay value though!
- Super Return of the Jedi (Game Gear) Sep 23 - Amazing on this platform!!!  Will come back and beat this.  Its not stupid hard like the SNES one and you continue from the stage you left off on unlimited continues  - play more - The Speeder chase kind of sucks.  How collision works is not clear at all for you or the enemies making it really difficult.  Its not that fun with rewind and I would have hated to play this without rewind.  Enemies and trees pop up out of nowhere from the front and the back.  Ok when you get used to it its not horrible just clumsy.  I beat that level in about 10 min.  
	- Its cool that you get to play as Wicket!  On these levels do not try to kill everything.  hit detection is bad and enemies take tons of damage.  just move forward generally up and to the right.  the boss is way too much life and therefore way too difficult
	- I'm playing a Han Solo level now and its cool and I'm having fun.  Most levels you can choose your player which increases replay value.  HOWEVER:  This is a game I would despise and just not play if it werent for rewind.  Even with save states I wouldn't play it because it would be too unforgiving to be fun.  The boss here was hard but fortunately nothing like the last  boss!  
	- On the next level its Luke time and theres a long tunnel where you can't possibly avoid getting hit over and over.  You also have to make your way back out too.  The only value of goign down the tunnel is an extra life but you will certainly use a life to get that life.  grr.  THen theres a platform that is partially hidden and you can barely see, and there is an enemy right at the bottom that you cant kill without getting hurt and the platform lowers down to get to just where you can just barely land on it but only if you jump really high and at the perfect time.  the lowest part of its arc is the highest point you can jump so you've got to be perfect.  
	- Oct 4 Beat it!  Especially the last few levels were too hard.  THe flying level I would have died so much.  thats probably true for the whole game tbh.

- Journey From Darkness: Strider Returns (Game Gear) - Clumsy and not worth playing although impressive for what it is.

- Vampire: Master of Darkness: (Game Gear) The most amazing castlevania like game.  It is its own game but takes cues from Castlevania and is a bit of a masterpiece! - play more
- Columns 3 (Genesis) - Cool that its got a single player mode but it really didnt pull me in but if I had been looking for a puzzle game back then it probably would have!
- Rastan Saga II (Genesis) - Not saying it looks LIKE Altered beast and it doesn't have the same character upgrade stuff, but it feels stiff in the same way and has big characters and a related enemy atmosphere and I feel like someone who liked that would like this too.  I like this more.  The background is awesome! Its hard not to get hit though but you can get wolverine claws!  - play more
- Castlevania (NES):  You know one thing in particular that I like about this game:  On this one level, if. you stand on a platform for longerr than you usually would (mabye 6 sec) a glowing treasure chest appears behind you near the edge of the screen.  you might never even see it if you dont know to look for it and you wouldnt normally stand there so its not everyone that is ever going to get that secret. It raises out of the ground like magic! I love that secret!  
- Super Bubble Bobble (Genesis) - Well they slightly changed the notes in the fun music and gave it a less bubbly chiptune instrument so its not quite as good.   They varied up the levels which is nice so I think its a good sequel but I want to play the original tbh and wont be playing this one again.   Oh and apparently there are bosses after certain levels in this game!
- SuperBoy 4 (Sega Master System) - Very Impressive!  they got the large sprites from Super Mario World on the Super Nintendo to animate and fly around on a Sega Master System!  I am impressed!  When I mean large sprites from Super Mario World I mean they literally copied them infringement style.  I dont know who made this but I know the SMS was big in South America especially into the 90s so I suspect it is from there.  If I were a kid who didnt have an NES or SNES and just had the SMS and I wanted a game like mario then I would have been pleased with this game!  Otherwise theres nothing noteworthy in the few levels I played and the jump control is workable but shitty.  I wont be playing it again.
- Ninja Five-O -  AMAZING game.  I played on easy and when you beat it it says "Try normal mode.  To Be Continued..."  I dont know if "To Be Continued" means that I have to beat it on normal mode to see the real ending but I suspect that it does.  
- Alien Syndrome (SMS) - This is a good version.  The story sets it as a sequel but it works exactly liek the first one did.  Not compelling enough for me right and no nostalgia so I wont play this again.
- Kung Fu Kid (Sega Master System) - The "kung fu" gameplay in this is extremely shallow.  Its more interesting in Alex Kidd.  Ok thats an exaggeration but regardless the controls and moves are lifeless and uninteresting.  The enemies constantly respawn and the levels are laid out and enemy placements lead to simple encounters that while somewhat frantic are ultimately boring.  With that said the collision detection and control are just good enough that it isn't too frustrating to kick your way through hordes of enemies and if it looks like fun to you then it probably will be.  There aren't any showstopping gameplay flaws its just clumsy and relatively unpolished.  Some positives are your jump is pretty explosive and the height is kind of exciting.  The arc of the jump isnt great but the velocity is fun.  There are unfortunatley no continues so its 3 lives and thats it, but you've got a power bar so you dont lose your life instantly.
- (most of the above was on 9/23 and 9/24 2018)
- Zool2 (Amiga 9-28-18) - Cool game!  Slippery controls but very fast scrolling.  Stopping from a jump is tricky but you get the hang of it enough.  fortunatley they dont expect lots of pixel perfect small platform jumps in this game (at least so far).  I'm on level 3 Tooting Common.  Continue Structure:  This would be shit without the codes I found on the internet.  It gives you like 4 lives and no continues.  Codes let you get 10 or 20 lives and start from any level (3 stages per level).  I've beat level 1 with 10 lives and level 2 with 20 (but I really only used 8-10).  I've been playing 2 player which means it switches between players when you die.  one nice thing is when you get to the boss it doesn teven make you leave the room you just use up all of your lives on that one boss and his health doesn treset or anything.  Thats really nice.  Its got real quirky stuff in it like trampolines that are made of over easy eggs!?!  you jump on the yolk and it propels you way up into the air.  One other cool and quirky thing is that in each level the paths are slightly different for the two cahracters in the game.  This took me a while to figure out and I was frustrated at first because I was watching a walkthrough and Zool jumped through a ceiling wall and Zooz just couldnt do it!?!   
	- Turns out she can break through the ground and he can't and vice versa.  That means that theres a spot in each level where you have to break through the ceiling but if you are Zooz you have to go find the (typically nearby) spot that lets you break through the floor and go a totally different route to ultimately wind up at teh same place.  I think thats actually a completely bad ass mechanic to add a lot to replay value!
	- Theres no life bar which is a bit strange and it means you have to keep track of your life in your head, but thats harder because its hardly noticable when you get hit.  Fortunaley you dont get knocked back at all but theres just a little scrape sound when you get hit and you go invincible for a few seconds.  I've figured out that you get 5 hearts but thats just because I was paying a lot of attention.   You can defenitley get more hearts from enemies but I've found that its so dangerous to try to attack them taht trying to heart farm has always been a net loss!  
	- I got super stuck on level 3 and when I watched a longplay I saw them doing two things that werent possible for me.  One was they were constantly spin jumping.  Well I just couldn't do that and I felt like maybe I was doing something wrong.  The other was they were sliding around poles and I couldn't do that either even though in the manual it said I could by pressing over and the fire button.  Well when I experimented with keyboard mappings I found out that the spac ebar is NOT the fire button it was just working A LITTLE BIT as the fire button. The control button is ACTUALLY the fire button. Once I swapped them I can spin jump way easier, shoot faster, and easily slide around poles!  I guess the nature of the timing of the space bar was screwing all of that stuff up or something!?!  I also found out you can do some kind of parkour wall-climb flip jump wiht the new fire button!  
	- Ok I just beat it!  (its now Oct 1 2019 so 3 days later) Levels 3 4 and 5 arent too bad in their own ways even if they require a lot of trial and error to figure out where to go and lots of deaths along the way.  only a few of them have lots of checkpoints.  The final level is brutal. There are no checkpoints and theres a lot of work that you have to do to get to the end.  Fortunately there are several 1ups hidden around (at least 3 on that level).  I noticed an interesting side effect of playing 2 players: The levels completely respawn.  If you are playing just one player then if you break some blocks on the last level they will be broken again when you go through the level a second time.  This applies to 1 ups too!  If you play 2 players then all of the blocks get reset to their original positions every time you die.  this also means all of the 1ups are available to be picked up every time you die.  I spent probably an hour farming 1 ups to beat the level since 2 of them can usually be retrieved within 90 seconds or so.  I only noticed all this when I beat it because then it became a 1 player game again and the level stopped resetting!
- Gimmick (Famicom Oct 4) - Beat it!  It was way too hard but great at the same time.  I used rewind constantly and it was tons of fun with rewind.  All of the bosses were hard but some of the bosses were amazing and some were way too hard.  Lots of cool touches as mentioned in Pats video.



 Evergreen games for me:
- Alex Kidd in Miracle World
- Wonder Boy III The Dragons Trap
- Ninja Five-O
- All Mario Bros Games
- Strider 2 on PSX

 --------------------
- James Pond II Codename Robocod (SMS) - Wow!  Content of this game aside they NAILED the technology.  I dont think there is a smoother playing platformer on the SMS!  If there is lets see it its certainly not sonic or wonderboy (nothing against those but the mechanics here are just so smooth!). The animation is lively and the scrolling is super smooth and very fast (faster and smoother than sonic on SMS See SG2).  The physics are excellent. The sense of momentum and the slide is great.  IT looks and feels like a 16bit game.  The jumps are perfectly arced and controlled.  The sprites are big, the colors are amazing the controls are perfect the sound is perfect the bouncing on enemies is near perfect the extending your torso is perfect. the platform collision detection is pixel perfect and overall the platforming in general is just fantastic.  Now I'm not even saying I'm havign as much fun as I do with Wonderboy 3.  I'm not.  This game seems to be quite shallow.  Its just incredible execution is all i'm saying.  I wish tehy had given this engine to other developers to make more interesting and varied games out of it!
	- This game is just a bunch of levels to explore and fiddle around in to try to find the exit all strung together with an overwoeld ccastle and all using these fun platforming mechanics.  Theres literally zero story and no sense of world building in this game which gives it an empty and shallow feeling.  I can't get into the 'shoes' or fins of this character.  The enemies and levels are really weird things that don't belong together in any way.  Candies and evil teddy bears and playing card butterflies and caterpillars, and party hats and records.  Theres no correlation and no setting in which these things would all be together as an antagonistic entity.  THe boss battles are cool but similarly disembodied like the first one is a teddy bear.  (SG1 below) Why are there spikes?  (SG1) WHy is this platform made of chocolate? 
	- (SG3) I've played this level 4 times now and keep getting sent back to the beginning so I must be doing something wrong!?! AHH the level design rolled me into a trick exit where I was supposed to jump on the pointy object immediately above it that looks like its going to poke my ass but is actually an elevator!
	- (SG4) Angel Wings! They're awesome!  I've decided the control is a slight bit too slippery for my tastes, but that doesnt take away from teh achievement of this physics engine it just means I woudl have preferred a little adjustment, or at least I THINK I would prefer it.  I wouldnt really know unless I tried it.
	- (SG5) The bouncey platform is great too!
	- THe music sucks.  It hasnt stopped the whole time and its really repetitive and not very interesting like a nursery rhyme.  
	- (SG6) OK there is some slowdown in parts.  This part doesnt seem like htere should be slowdown since its just some train enemies but ...  
	- (SG7) Second Boss is an anthropormorphic car with eyeballs and teeth.   Easy once you get the pattern down.
	- (SG7) The camera is not smooth when going up stairs like to teh left.  THat could be improved somewhat if I'm being picky.
	- (SG8)  the next level you take a bath and the bathtub floats around the screen and you pick up candy and pigs in a blanket and slugs with faces!
	- (SG8) Here you run around on Toothbrushes picking up dozens of rotary dial telephones!
	- (SG9) (Push to the left) Take that SONIC!  Blast Processing my ass!
	- (SG10) (push to the left) I dont like that spike pits are completely unforgiving in this game.  You fall in one and bounce and the next tiem you bounce you tak ea nother hit so a few seconds without being able to jump out and you are dead.  Fortunately you can still jump from teh floor pretty high to get out you just have ot make sure to land on something solid when you do.
	- (SG11) Here you get to fly an airplane!  Pretty cute and fun! 
	- (SG12) this is the queen of hearts boss and shes actually really tough.  Its fair enough but I wish there was a bigger hit box on her head.  it wouls still be hard.
	- (SG13) Jingle Bells music???
	- (SG14) Here while it plays chrismas music I can choose one of two exits I dont know which is best but one is less obvious and therefore possibly more 'secret' shhh
	- (SG15) Now I've got a car!
	- (SG17) The one thing that can kill you outright: THe dreaded platform!
	- (SG18) LArge Marge Boss!
	- (SG19) Final Boss!
	- (SG20) Ending Screens
	- (SG21) Here I backed up to see what happens when you lose all of your lives.  It loosk like there are only two continues.  thats dumb.  How far back does it put you though? looks like it puts you at the beginning of the stage you were on inside the stage (not outside by the door). however I found a cheat and its a cool one.  it works on genesis as well (and my guess is that it works on all the platforms!) "At the sports level, spell out the word ''lives'' by picking up these items in this order: lips, ice cream, violin, Earth, snowman."  thats the first level of the game so just do that there and you've got unlimited lives!  This guy agrees that its silly to think you could complete it without a cheat: https://youtu.be/Kqu-hosFXIM?t=1m49s
	- So I fiddled with the genesis version too just to see what was different.  For one thing the backgrounds were way better (as expected) with parallax scrolling for all.  They were also more detailed of course.  I have to say the sprites dont look vastly different which is surprising.  I'm sure if we looked closely we would be able to find substantial differences, but it just speaks to the quality of the SMS version that they both look really good.  Theres lots more detail in the little pickups and stuff.  The music is the same but the instruments are higher quality and in this case it sounds better as a result.  The gameplay is virtually identical.  Strangely the SMS version feels better to me but that might just be because I just got done beating it.  However one legit difference is you can't jump on things as much with the genesis version.  You have to do the down stomp or it hits you.  For example the ghosts that pop up out of pits on SMS you can kill them by jumping on them but on Genesis you cant kill them at all.
	-  (SG24 on SMS and SG2 on the genesis version) If you want to see the difference check out the first boss on the genesis version.  After playing the SMS then the Genesis version then going back to the SMS version the graphics distinctions are clearer but the cool thing is that they are never to the point that there is any substantial disadvantage.  Its better on the genesis without question and in every way ... its just that the gameplay is so solid and the graphics so fantastic on the SMS that the difference in quality ... well ... doesnt matter. 
 ----------------------

- Ax Battler (Game Gear) - In the Golden Axe universe this is a cross between dragon warrior, Zelda 2, and Legendary Axe (not Golden Axe).  The combat and dungeons are 2d sidescroller fighting sections while the rest looks just like Dragon Warrior ( well better but ...).  I dont like the combat.  Its not fun.  Its pickier and harder than Zelda 2. That part isnt like Golden axe at all but if it were this would be a game for the ages!  Like if they had just mixed in parts of the actual golden axe game (edit that togethers o it looks like that) from the SMS this would have been legendary!  (SG2) In this game you actually throw a bomb at a MOUNTAIN.  And it WORKS!!!  Ok the combat isnt as bad once you get the high jump in the city since I have retreat options now.  But its still bad when you get to the peninsula tower.  There are a bunch of enemies which are really difficult even with REWIND!  Also its one of those games like when you get the crystal you dont know what to do with it.  This chicken leg told me to get it but I didnt know I was supposed to bring it back to HIM!?! When i use it I go on the back of the turtle (SG5) and the combat here like in the cave is frustrating because the camera doesnt let you see whats coming up so you get hit all the time by enemies coming in from the right.  Here you can kill dragons with one hit even though skeletons took 4 and were really brutal to you.  In a desert you encounter more chicken legs and they can apparently (SG7) whip you from 4 of their body lengths away!?!  I really like how you train to get new powers.  (load SG8 and then show off the upswing and the high jump and the jump swing and the new one which is super swing)  
	- So I already beat this pyramid in the desert but I didnt get anythign from it.  Turns out youre supposed to jump OVER the pyramid and then you get a key!?! WTF!?!  How would I have known to do that.  The path the game is leading me down goes THROUGH the pyramid.  Its a secret room at the top and critical items should never be secrets!?!  If this was a long game I wouldn't play anymore but its apparently pretty short and I'm like halfway through (which is how I LIKE games like this) so I think I will continue.
	-  (SG11) The random battles are way too common
	-  (SG12) Chapter 7 https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gamegear/586640-ax-battler-a-legend-of-golden-axe/faqs/10373
	-  	Just got the compass and the tackle power (Show the tackle power)

	-  (SG15) Chapter 8 Mountain
	-  (SG16) Glitch! I got stuck in a mountain!  Duck and im safe!
	-  (SG17) About to be picked up by an eagle!  Also the music here is exactly like Zelda 2 Castle Music
	-  (SG18) Chapter 9 
	-  (SG19) Just got the downward thrust
	-  (SG20) here you get a magic stone in a swap square when you search.  There was NO CLUE telling you to do that, just that a guy lost his magic stone.  Its just from the level design and that square sticking out a bit visually that you would even know that was worth searching in.  
	-  (SG21) Chapter 10
	-  (SG23) Shitty Arrow part.  THen "Where do I go now?  Oh a random floating loofah flies down to fetch me?  Right.  What the fuck?  HOw do I avoid these arrows?  Fuck.  Now I made it to the top now what?  Oh sure a random mirror appears out of the floor?  Right!"
	-  (SG24) Here I'm stuck at the end of the game.  Theres no where to go!!!  I looked everywhere for one of the damn mirrors.  It turns out its on this platform.  Not here on the platform.  Not in the center of the platofrm but if you stand on the right side of the platform (of course) and then ride it all the way to the top ...  DAMN!  and ... theres no final boss!  Thats good because I was almost dead!  but finally the deed is done!!
 
--------------------------------------
- Amagon (NES) - 
	- Zone 1-1: I remember this so fondly from rentals as a kid.  
	- I guess it was the box and something about the fantasy of the skinny boy becoming really strong and powerful that I loved (Show cover art).  I remember renting it and spending hours with it and not getting very far and feeling like a failure.  Only now in hindsight do I know that is because it was a shitty game and it was not my fault.  I am not a failure!  (I'm just saying that to make myself feel better!).  The graphics are pretty shitty even for an NES game.  Mostly that is.  
	- Level 1:
	- (SG28) Your characters sprite isnt bad (even if hes cartoony) and its cute how he ducks and becomes a little flat ball of flesh or like coils up like a snake or something!  
	- (SG25) Whats actually beautiful for an NES game is the reflections on the water. Thats amazing!  Theres no fancy scrolling or anything so the backgrounds just look cheap to me.  
	- (SG26) The mountain isnt too bad but its not colorful.  
	- (SG27) There arent many colors though adn theres a lack of shading on some mountains but not others.  There is shading on the rocks and trees and the top of the grass.  
	- (SG29) I also like how he jumps by pulling his knees up under his chin!  
	- 
	- Ok now THATS the powerup or as its known in the manual the Mega-key.  I remember in 1990 getting the powerup in the game and not knowing what to do with it to activate it!  That was always frustrating to me.   I did eventually figure out back then how to activate the powerup because at first when you rented the NES game it came with the manual in the little clear case.  It is easy in hindsight (its just pressing select) but I do remember for a long time thinking I was doing something wrong and thinking I needed to do something else ot powerup.  I couldn't fathom that it wouldnt activate automatically at first.   
	- Oh and now he has a life bar!  
	- I like how his uppercut takes out any enemy!  
	- Its funny how his face scrunches down when hes Megagon!  
	- 
	- Points and life
	- (SG32) If you activate the Mega-Key with just a small number of points you only get a small amount of life.  5000 is the minimum and 70000 is the max but to get 70000 you usually have to have to gone through some enemies and died and gone through them again.  Typically on level one you will collect about 20000 points and which gets you about this much life which is plenty to make it to and through the boss as long as you spam the uppercut button :)
	- 
	- How about a little background here
	-   Hey look in the first screen of the game you can see your escape ship!
	- 
	- 
	- When the level is complete and your guy looks at you he looks ... mildly satisfied with his triumphant victory over the deadly werewolf beast! 
	- (SG31) Level 2: Fuck those bees!  You cant hit those tiny things with that shitty gun and this control.  The control isnt bad but it isnt contra either.  Ok theres a part on level 2 where there are two tree platforms and a grass platform in the middle all on the water.  Theres a mushroom in the middle and there is NO WAY you could figure out what to do the first time through.  You have to jump onto the platform just right (controls arent perfect remember) and then jump BACK on to the tree because even if you jump  on to the platform just right he tears off and jumps back and forth and doesnt stay on his own side of the bed but jumps onto your side too!  In the next part birds are attacking like a barrage of bullets adn you have to creep forward very slowly to be able to aim and hit them.  Also the jumping parts when there are birds coming at you at every level suck.  Ok the bosses are ok because as long as you come in with more than 3 health you can take them out by spamming your uppercut.  Lets see what happens if I die?     Continues please???  Wait what is this on level 3?   An elephant man with man-boobs???  Ok wait theres something fucked up here.  Theres limited ammo per level.  Thats ok as far as it goes (stupid but whatever) but I started level 3 with only 14 bullets!  I emptied thim into this elephant fatass and that didn ttake him out so then it just goes to this weakling trying to beat your enemies with his empty rifle!  So two problems: One: Limited ammo Two: Limited ammo for the WHOLE GAME?  It doesnt reload your ammo at the beginning of the stage?  I dont get more ammo from the enemies I am killing?  What is going on!?!  Elephant man comes at you relentlessly and you can jump over him ok but then when he turns around he RUNS RELALY FAST!  Fortunately theres nothing you can accidentally bump into right?  NOO BEES!!!!  NO AMMO!!! SHIT!!!  Also remember.  One hit kills with this weakling.  Funny: When he runs out of ammo his posture is epic!  Thats one hell of a case of anterior pelvic tilt!  Hes on his tippytoes!!!      For added fun the elephant man lays eggs, and they are not formed in his uterus they are formed in the region of his head and he squirts them out of his elephant trunk right at your face at high velocity when you least expect it.  THey are eggs of death so they will kill you if they touch you so if anterior pelvic tilt boy is trying to get up close enough to hit him with the butt of his rifle you'd better pray youve timed your attack between the trunk based eggsplosion or you're DEAD MEAT!  NO CONTINUES!?!  Ok I learned that once you beat level 4 there will be a level select option. I wish I had known this when I was a kid because I would have been more motivated to struggle through to that level.  I'm quite sure I never even beat level 2 as a kid though so that would have been very tough and possibly impossible for my childhood non upgraded nintendo hands.  So on level 3 if you can shoot the elephant man enough you get the powerup to amagon.  Now I only have like 4 life ... why?  Does this carryover from last time too?  Is it related to my score at the time?  How do you increase your life?  After a while I have to jump on the back of a monochrome depressed turtle with a constant flame coming out of its asshole like a pilot light.  This jet ass-engine apparently gives him the capability to hover in mid air.  Does he have F-35 style thrust vectoring in his asshole?  WIth the not too precise jumping and the tutrles shell not providing a very stable platform to land on and with the spiders falling and bees shooting projectiles it seems virtually impossible to me for someone to beat this section without taking hits.  At the end of level 3 (probably level 2-2) right when its a bout to send me into a boss battle, it chickens out and makes me small and sends me to the next level.  Why?  Couldn't come up with another boss sprite?  It even plays the exciting boss battle music!  Well its acually good because I only had 2-3 life left at the time.  I think its cool how his uppercut can kill things even down by his feet like he crouches to the ground and back up in less than a frame of animation so we cant even see it!   Part way through level 4 there is a Crocodile man or Dinosaur or some shit.  They are like the fat elephant man and they take 15 shots from your gun.  THey shoot snot bubbles at you so you have to duck to hit them. Well this is the first time I've seen these guys and they dont put you on a platofrm with a lot of room so its relaly hard to get past this part.  Land on platform, see new guy, wonder what he does, try to dodge snot bubble, shoot once which should take him down.  What it doesnt?  Shoot many more times!  Oh oh that took too long.  Die and try again (remember one hit kills).  Well next time you get there you know what to do.  Duck and shoot like mad.  ANd that works, except hes got backup.  Thats right its the first time youve ever seen this guy and there are TWO of them!?!  THeres BARELY enough time if you know they are there and start shooting before they actually get on screen to kill them both.  
	-  (11:08:02) A little later theres one in the water down at the bottom of the screen.  Hes just tooting along and you figure that hes too low so he will not be a threat atm.  Well if you dont go EXtREMELEY carefully you will die because he jumps so quick and remember one hit kills?  Even if you are super careful he jumps onto the platform and by that point you have very little space to retreat so if you can super quickly run to the left, turn around, duck, and shoot like mad then you MIGHT be able to take him out just before he hits you as hes creeping near on his crocodile man-legs.   If you let him come to you you stand a better chance of beating him.
	-   (11:18:39) At the end of level 3-1 (which I've mistakenly been calling level 4) The boss battle is so bad ass.  There are two of those crocodile men.  reasonalby spaced out.  Lots of room to jump their projectiles.  They dont attack at once.  Wait did I say bad ass?  Its shit.  Its far easier than the other three encounters with the crocodile men earlier in the level.  
	-   (11:26:37) At least zone 3-2 gives you a useful tip. Get as many bullets as possible.  You're telling me that now?  That would have been a good tip for the beginning of the game!?! Instead what about at the beginning of the game:  No Bullet Refills: Collect as many as possible. 
	-   (11:32:54) This is the final Hippo Boss for stage 3.  Its not hard and I think its actually pretty cool but the hard part is just getting to this boss.  Just imagine tryiing to make it through these 6 levels without dying 3-4 times!?!  And then getting to this boss because theres so much platform jumping here that its not too hard to not get hit by the boss but accidentally jumping into the pond and dying thats EASY.
	-   (11:36:15) Imagine getting to zone 4 without dying.  According to the codes I read about thats your safe zone becasue you can now continue!  Whew. I've only got one life left so that makes me feel better.  Continue. Hell yeah!  Continue from Zone 4!!! 
	-   Wait why does it say zone 2?  none of the arrow keys change the selection!?! Oh wait maybe it sthe select button?  Whew!  Ok zone 3 and zone 4 .. wait ... what ... (cycles through) no zone 4???  I have to start at the beginning of zone 3!?! What the actual fuck!?!  So when i read the code again it says if you get to zone 4 then you will get a continue screen and can continue at the beginning of any zones you've already beaten.  not at the end of them?  Not where i left off?  What kind of continue is that!?! You know what theres something worse.  Watch this.  (selects zone 3). (dies 4 times).  Game OVer?  No Continue? So this just pissed me off and the shit of it is that once you get to level 4 you unlock the continue feature which only lets you continue from stages you have beaten, but theres a catch!  if you die on any of the stages prior to level 4 its game fucking over.  Game over!  So I've been trying all this time to get to level 4 to unlock the continue feature thinking I wouldnt have to go back to the earlier levels again but you do.  Basically it just helps a little.  You have to get to level 4 with no continues and when you do you have to then beat three AND four and make sure you beat three with no continues.  Then once you've beat 4 hopefully you can level select form there on properly.  GEEZ!!!
	-   (11:48:47) Watdch out for "skelton" monster?
	-   (11:53:07) Beat level 4 onto level 5 something about clouds???  Look at this I'm jus trealizing how strange the jump is: If you let up on the button he drops liek a rock!  But ok on this level I should be able to continue if I die right?? WRONG!  You always have to start out one level early and beat through that level and the next.  There are only 6 zones total.  So you have to get through the first half of the entire game on one continue then from then on you have to get through one third of the game on one continue to progress and oh I dont know if I made this clear.  If you get to level 4 and you die then as we talked about you have to start on level 3 and you have one continue to beat level 4 or you have to start back on level 3 again, but whats MUCH WORSE is if you use your continue on level 3 beofre you even get to level 4, even after youve been to level 4 before you are GAME OVER.  In some sense that means its the hardest stupidest part of the game.  
	-   (12:22:34) Zone 6-1. on this shitty level they introduce aliens, crabs are humping the trees, and you dont get amagon until the final screen of the boss fight!?!  what the fuck?
	-   (12:28:10) Zone 6-2 Final Level!!!
	-   (12:32:23) Final Boss! then you get some quick cutscene showing an escape from the idsland and some pretty good tunes and "You survived your mission  The end ..."
	-   Lets go back and see if I can beat each zone with just one continue with no cheats.
	-   (12:39:30) Starting Zone 1 - Good news: There are at least invisible checkpoints!  Ok Didnt make it on my first try.  It took me about 10 minutes to beat the whole first level (1-1) once.  But to beat the whole first level consistently enough that I could get to the second level with enough lives and then beat the whole second level (1-2) in one go well I never did it!  I spent 45 minutes attempting it.  I was really fed up after 30 minutes.  Now I know that logically and statistically I could do it.  If I stopped now my brain would take in some of what I learned today and tomorrow I would be better at both levels.  If I did that every day I could get through level 1-2 in a few days I believe and at that point what would I have achieved?  A great triumph?  well sort of yeah.  But not really because I'm not even close to being done.  I have to get through zone 2 and zone 3 before I even have a chance to continue.  That means I need to get through zones 1-1 and 1-2 so consistently that I can do them perfect every time because Imma need my lives on zones 2 and 3 and really I'm going to have to do the same thing of getting consistently good on zone 2 because I remember zone 3 being a bitch.    Meanwhile I cant play zone 2 unless I beat zone 1 every single game so getting practice on zone 2 is exponentially harder to get than zone 1.  This is not FUN guys its NOT FUN!!!  The game is fun one level at a time.  If there were continues by zone I would say this is a pretty good fun game if simple and a bit rough around the edges, but it has some fun gameplay at its core, but in its untouched state I can't say this is a fun game!  In the 45 minutes I 
	-   died dozens of times, 
	-   Got game over onlevel 1-1 9 times
	-   times
	-   Fought the level 1 boss 13
	-   times
	-   reached level 1-2 4
	-   times
	-   Got game over on level 1-2 4
	-   time
	-   At one point in my game I started getting lots of one up pickups!?!  I wonder why???
	-   
	-   THen I decided to cheat and practice level 1-2 to get good at it first.  When I did I figured out some fucked up shit.  You really can't afford to die because your ammo doesnt reset even after death.  It doesnt start you at the checkpoint with the ammo you had at that checkpoint.  it starts you with the ammo you had when you died.  This means if you blow through an area using ammo and die you will never get that ammo back.  you can't afford to be low on ammo when you get to the second zone so if you die after the wrong area (any heavy ammo use area) you are fucked.  Finally after trying it dozens of times for 20 minutes straight my brain is burned out and I give up.  It feels futile and although I'm sure there are people out there who have done it and although I'm sure that better players than me could do it with less trouble, the continue structure of this game makes it a beating and steals the fun away from what otherwise would be a cool little game and somewhat of a simple classic that people woudl com eback to from time to time.  As it is if you were lucky/unlucky ennough to play this back in the day then you either quickly dismissed it for what it is (unfair and not fun enough to overcome the unfairness) or you like me didnt know any better and thought you just sucked at it.  Well Im glad to shed light on the reality of it for all of you and for the child in me who is relieved to know that it wasnt just that little guys fault.  it just sucked!
	-   
	-   Update: What if I tried to beat it with the infinite lives game genie code?  That might be the right balance between the lopsided replay/continue-based-difficulty and making it too easy with like invincibility or something.   Clearly since they thought of adding a continue at level four they did TRY to get their continue structure balanced and thats what they wanted, they just royally fucked it up!  Then if I die I go back to the designated checkpoint but I don't ever have to start the whole game over again!  I just have to beat every checkpoint section of the game legitimately without rewind.  This sounds like a fun challenge and one which I would like to try.  I have a feeling there will be some levels in the middle that have such stupid enemy arrangements that it is going to be extremely difficult even with unlimited lives but its worth a shot!

 --------------------------------
- Risky Woods (Genesis) - I wish I had bought this for the Amiga back in the day because I knew a lot about this and wanted it but never ended up really going for it and if I had paid full price for it I would have valued it even more and its a fair enough game I would have had tons of fun with it!  then again I bet the controls werent as good with up to jump on the Amiga.  sad face.  I bet the Amiga music is better but this version is great.  The graphics are awesome and the gameplay is cool. I fucking love the boomerang!  The boomerang is one of the best weapons in any game ever made! I like the level progression which has you collect things and then play a simple simon game to pass a gate.  I finished level one but it said I didnt save all of the souls and started me over.  Turns out I had to break another statue like the one at the end that Elvis comes out of and then flies into the heavens.  It kind of blended into the background the first time through and was on an apparently alternate path.  You keep your weapons when you die and start in the same place you died!  You die a lot from things that dont make sense like things in a treasure chest.  Also its weird that you have to duck to pick up items (even coins!?!).  It doesnt restore your life when you beat a stage!?!  Does it let you continue from that stage?  Theres a weapon on level 2 that it wont even let you get!?!  you beat the simon game and it throws the weapon onto a windowsill which you cant jump up to at all!  I want to see what that weapon is like but I cant at this point.  Thats ok I have the boomerang!  Hes weaaring like a toga or something!?!   Sometimes the apples poison you adn sometimes they give you points.  Why do the powerups and pickups kill you?  The boomerang sucks for getting enemies that are about to jump up stairs to you or are flying just beneath you.  One of the powerups warps you back to the beginning of the level!?!  TH scrolling is great.  Update: Its fatal flaw is revealed.  Its really tough and there are no continues.  Update: If you use EOA for your high score name you can do level select!  The Amiga version looks a bit choppier actually.  The guy looks way more bad ass though.  Sometimes the Elvis statues are decoys that just flame on and burn your little tiny feetsies!  Whoa in the Amiga version tehre is a shop between levels! Oh I see that was replaced by the simon game and the getting weapons from the eye key.  Whenever you go indoors it uses a cool technique to make it seem darker than when it was outside.  But its too dark to see whats going on!?!  The sickle and flame circle are awesome weapons as well!  I'm pretty sure on this cave boss theres no physical way to beat him without getting hit.  I think for a game with limited continues thats cheap and not good game design.  I figured out a trick with the boomerang for the boss in the cave: Shoot backwards!  You never get hit!  well ... WHAT?  To beat the cave level you commit hari-kari???? My heart will go on ... OMG on the Amiga verison (in fact every version but the genesis afaik) theres no way to continue!?!  WTF.  Never mind I am so gald I did not buy this back then It would have been super fun for an hour or two but then ultimately made me feel like really bad at computer games.  I'm pretty sure the one up in the chest is a little motherfucker that can't be got!  What/. Falling down pits doesnt kill you it just takes some life away? I guess thats fair but doesnt make much sense and doesnt help much if there are no continues!?!  Nope on level 4 theres literally no way to tell the two statues apart!  THe axe weapon is awesome!  unless you want to get coins out of a purse that is right in front of you!?!  If its not in front ofyou then they will disappear before you collect them!?!  THe spikey cephalopod bats on level 4 are cheap as hell.  Almost as cheap as the shitty fireball demons on level 1.  Beginning of level 5 is a good example.   There is apparently a minimum hit distance that if the enemy is closer than that you cant hit them so If they get up in your face you cant hit them and they just hit you over and over and just slightly bounce off of you so close they can hit you again quickly but not far enough that you either a. have a chance to escape or b. can hit them from that short distance.  
- Shit there are time outs in this game too!?!  Ok there are two continues.  THats not nearly enough!?!  Update: Good news I found a cheat on the Amiga.  If you type 'rip' then you can push f1 for more money f2 for more life and f3 for level skip!  Now I take it back and with that information I would have fucking LOVED this game as a kid!  OTOH I don't know how I would have obtained that information.  I just imagine spending $40 or $50 for this game waiting a week for it to get shipped to my local computer store (Where I bought games) playing it for a few hours.  Getting extremely frustrated.  And giving up.  I would have then later thought: Hmm maybe there is a way to get more continues or something.  But where would I look?  scour my old amiga magazines.  Yeah I would have done that but it would have been dumb luck if I had happened to find the amiga magazine that published that code! And amiga magazines werent like NP with a secrets section in every issue.  I would have more chance of figuring out the code myself! Well ok thats not true but ... what else would I have done?  I wouldn't know for sure there was a code and I would probably ask lots of people adn they would say "well I dont know of one." and then someone would say "yeah I don tthink theres a code for that game.  sorry" and I would believe them and give up. Then 25 years later I would be playing this game in 2018 and fin dthe code on the internet and say FUUUCKKK!!!  When you do this cheat on the genesis and then select your level in the options menu when you use it you actually play as a different characgter with a face helmet and hairy limbs!  I think its an ape man but they don't want to tell you that!  Hes also semi-invincible which is a nice bonus feature!  I say semi because at one point he degraded back to the old character and I was losing health again.  One thing I like is that when you get to the key and if you don thave part of the key it transports you right back to where the key was!  This happens on level 4 at least.  That means they really thought of a lot of things (even if they didnt give enough damn continues!?!). Alright! Stage 4 complete!  Stage 5 is pretty fucked up since I think the only way to get the first key eye is to get to the door adn take damage to have it transport you back!?!  wtf!?!  Also when you are standing on platforms on stage 5 after the second door the dudes can just jump a little bit from the bottom platform and you take a hit!   Thats from dudes where there is literally no way to hit them naturally!  Stage 5 completed!  Ugh!?! Stage 6 boss is stupid.    Even with my boomerang trick I don't think there could possibly be a way to beat that guy without losing several lives in the process!?! I wonder if one of the other weapons would be powerful against him megaman-style???  Stage 7 music is fine but its so happy!?! Its totally incongruous with the death and destruction and golden demonic-lizard statues and bloodstains on the walls!   It would fit in pretty well in Donkey Kong Country (insert some DKC footage with that soundtrack)   The third lock on stage seven sends half of your weapon options into the pit and I dont think they ever playtested that!  When you go a little too far to the right it locks you off from going left again.  This means the only way to go back to get the key-eyes is when you get to the lock and it teleports you back (and takes half your health!?!). Also on stage 8 the first statue you see is on an upper deck but you dont know that until you've gone too far to get back to the platform that gets you to the upper deck!?!  I think they designed it in this way! I know this because when I get to the first lock i dont have all of the key-eyes so it teleports me back to a key-eye that wasnt there before!?!  I lost life when they did that!?! only then can I get to the statue again.   There is DEFINITELY no way to kill the statues without getting hit.    Oh and throughout there is a time limit to make sure that if you have any trouble durin gthe level with any of teh puzzles or enemies that you will die and it iwll be by definition far along in the level and probably right before you get to the end of the level and be taken all the way back to the beginning of the level with all of your level progress cleared out.  fuck.  It doesnt do this to you if you die once or twice but only if you run out of time.  Stage 8 is a good example of an easy place to run out of time.  And whats this bullshit on level 8 when there are TWO of the statues double teaming you!?!  Its not like in some of the classic platformers where they put these beasties on levels in certain places so you would ahve to figure out a good strategy to get through it unharmed or minimally harmed.  In those games (castlevania was pretty good about this) if you're really skilled and experienced you can get through it unharmed, but if you're not you'll take your licks before you find a strategy and attack that gest you through.  In this part of this game theres no strategy that could possibly hit these guys.    no one of any skill would be able to get through this unscathed.  Thats shit. Near the end of stage 8 theres a statue which you have to destroy.  not because it has an elvis (thank you very much) in it oh no!  Because it has a key-eye in it but that means since it doesnt have an elvis in it it will damage you.  SO to beat this level you HAVE to have that much damage available.  bullshit.  There are definitely some ghosts and goblins similarities with this game.  Stage 9 boss is slightly more fair since if you make a pixel perfect jump you can jum pthe fireballs at least.  What? His head dies but his body is till moving like a chicken with it shead cut off!?!   This game violates a fundamental rule of good game design: Make the players death their fault.  If they can't avoid taking damage or dying no matter what its not their fault and it takes the senese of control away from the player, like they are not in control of thier own fate.  It makes you feel powerless and thats not what games are about!?! THeyare about feeling like a bad ass hwen you beat a level because you made the righ tjumps and attacks to minimize damagae and survive and sometime syou do it relaly well and feel like a super bad ass!  Not in this game.  Surviving is tough enough but theres no opportunity for real improvement.  No way to get so good you dont get hit.  Nothing really to strive for.  No reason to get way better at it, and given the limited continues and forced damage taking its not a fun challenge to try to get good enough to beat it with "skill" its not FUN!  Not to mention its fucking unfair and frustrating.  After the first key on stage 10 theres a platform that legitimately looks like it doesnt exist.  I was waiting for a moving platform to come and retrieve me but no... you need to do a leap of faith into the void.  Stage 10 complete (by the seat of my pants due to time limit). Stage 11 is just FULL of shit you cant avoid.  Constant demon bats flying at you from every direction while you try to kill those statues.  ARRGH!  Stage 11 Completed!  Based on the map area that I can see level 12 is the final boss and it had better be because this guy is a bitch!  Theres virtually no way to dodge his projectiles, you dont get to select your weapon so if you just beat level 11 then you will have fewer lives but if you just continued to here you'll just have the kknife.  And his life goes down SO SLOW!!!  and whats worse even if you find a strategy that seems to be taking down his life ... you've got a time limit.  And its only TWO MINUTES!!?!?!  I candefintely report that the knife works well on this guy.  Certainly better than the sickle (which doesnt really make sense but whatever!?!). or maybe its just because I still have the faceplate and I didnt when I had the sickle last time ... who knows!?!  OK I BEAT IT!!  theres no text just your guy on a mountain raising his staff over and over.  Thats pretty cool though.    Ok now I was playing wtih tthe optiosn and realied I can select any level I want PAST 12. That scared me because I was afraid there were going to be many more levels that you are supposed to get through without any continues ACK!  Well lets see what level 13 is!  Oh cool!  its the end screen where hes raisng his staff!  Ok whats 14 then?  Oh its the same.  It goes all the way up to 34 and I presume they are all the same!  (test this to be really thorough).  Well thats it for Risky Woods.  Some little problems and two big ones: Forced Damage and No Unlimited Continues.  Still I actually had a lot of fun playing and beating it the way I did and finding all of these gems to point out to you.  I hope you liked this and I hope you learned something about good and shitty game design in the process!  Party On!

# Late 2019 Games #
* Xenocrisis - I bought this full price because it looked so damn cool.  I presumed the continue structure would be modern and not 1992 broken but I was (mostly) wrong.  5 lives on easy mode 3 continues and thats it.  I got through the first dungeon and the second and beat both bosses and its really damn cool, but its like SmashTV and not the arcade version but the home version with inexplicable and unfair limited continues.  I'm a bit mad about this and might play it again tomorrow but will probably return it unless I look through the manual and find a reasonable official easy way to continue from the level I stopped on.   Update 30min later: I've dug through the discussions and found out that I was right the continue structure is pretty broken. In fact in some ways its worse than I thought: There are only 3 continues, but if you beat the game using 2 or 3 continues you get to the end and ... game over.  No final boss.  no ending screens or story or celebration.  Just death.  I think thats shit.  In fact if you use even a single continue you get that same result.  This was deliberate on the part of the dev and hes had to defend it from a number of people who think the game is too hard like me.  I just dont know about this.  Its really really good but I am not in the mood for another brutal game right now.  I believe I could eventually beat levels 1 and 2 on easy on one continue eventually but there are 7 fucking levels.  Ok at least they did provide a cheat menu where you can specify the seed for the procedural rooms and also unlimited health, and or continues and you can pick your starting level.  Here are some of the discussions I took part in: 
	* HirmHund: The brutal 1cc requirement of Xeno Crisis is a design flaw. What good is your final boss if 99% of players will never see it outside of youtube?   Xenoleinzer: I agree with this. It's normal to reward skilled players but in this case I have the impression that most of the players are punished with a game over ending despite their efforts to finish it with 3 credits.  Me: Agreed. I want to be able to experience the game you've created for us, see the artwork and graphics, blast the enemies, figure out the boss patterns, and have fun and re-live some of the experience of the 90s games that I loved but without the frustration and feelings of defeat I often had back then. My free time is precious to me so its not so much fun for me to spend significant time building up my skills or feeling frustrated and repeating the early levels of games over and over to get one level closer to the end and have to start over again and again. I have a lot of fun trying a single thing a thousand times until I get good at it and beat it, but its discouraging and disheartening for me to have to go back to the beginning. I'm going to try the cheat mode to simulate this experience and I hope it works.  Meanwhile an alternative that might be more satisfactory for a lot of us less hardcore players is if you get to the end under any circumstances, then you get a simple picture and one screen ending that celebrates your win with something like this: "Congratulations! You have defeated the hordes of darkness (use canon words here of course). Unfortunately the boss escaped and will be back another day to scourge the galaxy with a new horde of evil minions. Try again with fewer continues to capture the boss and save the galaxy once and for all". Don't give them the full ending or the final boss, but don't dump them in the gutter with a game over. This would still achieve your design choice of significantly rewarding players who beat it with <1 continue but would not punish or insult players who have invested their precious time and money into the game but don't have the time to invest in getting so much better.
	* Originally posted by Bitmap Bureau: too many games of the 80s / 90s era allowed you to credit feed, Me: My memory of genesis games in the 80s / 90s was different. I honestly wish I had been able to play more Genesis games which let me credit feed because there are dozens of games I never got to see much of because I was never good enough to get very far at all.  Which games are you referring too when you say 'too many'?  P.S. I don't mean to be hard on you I honestly want to know and actually understand where you are coming from: the hardcore retro game difficulty (I remember it well .. too well) and respect it even if I don't like it (and will am considering returning the game because of it)
	* Update 30min later: So I used the unlimited ammo cheat and with just that I was able to beat the 3rd level with 0 continues.  I'm really proud of myself.  I am starting to see what the dev means and its not so bad anymore.  HOWEVER: If I hadn't dug through the discussions and found how to get to the seed and cheats menu I would feel ripped off annoyed angry and insulted.  Update: Nest Cleared no continues used!  Although: I only had one life left though.  
	* Update 30min later:  So admittedly I've had some gin and typing is hard, but I'm on the forest level and its much more difficult than the last.  I haven't been able to beat it on one continue and I've tried 5 times now.  Its a really fun game though so its ok.  I've revised my feelings about it somewhat, but it could have been clearer about its intentions with me and my feelings.  It could have announced that it was going to fuck with my feelings and make me feel not so powerful.  I'm playing with inifinite ammo and I dont honestly see how I could beat it with finite ammo regardless of continues.  Ok I finally beat it using 3 continues
	* Already played it for 100 minutes so I'm almost up to the 2h limit for returns.  I dont think I'll return it since its been decent fun so far, but its so close to wonderfulness that its sad.  I don't know if I'll ever beat it unless I just use unlimited continues.  I don't think I'll ever see the final boss. :( 
	* Next day.  I tried the genesis version and its no better.  On emulators you can save state which would seem like that would fix it but no it really doesn't because beating the first boss without using any continues is incredibly difficult and in this one there are no options for unlimited continues so I just spent 20 min trying to beat that one boss without using a continue to no avail.  
* Warhammer: Vermintide 2 - The combat is amazing!  I had a ton of fun adventuring to escape some skaven base.  The amount of backstory and canon in this game and in their universe is staggering. This is a lot of fun. I think its on sale?    Update: Played it at Trey's LAN Party and it was a complete blast!
* Lego Jurassic World - Wow the PC controls are broken as hell.  It is a chore and nightmare to move the players around.  It is advertised in the manual that you can use keyboard and mouse but no it wont let you use the mouse at all even to select menu items.  Its absurd.  Further in the process of trying to switch to gamepad I activated the second player and couldnt deactivate.  Further and the nail in the coffin is the saves are way too far apart and this was something I remember from some of the other games too.  
* Red Faction 2 -  5.1hrs on record in Steam. Short and sweet just how I like it.   Heres the review I posted on Steam in its entirety: "This is a great game and I had a blast playing it in 2019.  To address the mixed reviews I think I understand what is going on here. When you hold this title up against its predecessor there are some things missing from this title which I think warrant some peoples complaints namely: there's not much of the game that is destructible which is sorely missed since it was such a huge aspect of the first game, and its shorter than the first game (it was a perfect length imho but to each his own). Those are valid complaints when you compare it with the first game and I guess I just wish they had named it something other than Red Faction because when you look at the game without comparing it to its predecessor its great! What you get in place of those aspects that are missing is a more exciting action packed game with more interesting NPCs, great voice acting (the great actor Jason Statham voices one of the characters!), excellent vehicle levels to add variety and interesting boss fights. The story had twists and turns which kept it interesting all the way through. This whole game was cinematic. The gunplay is excellent. All of the weapons feel appropriately powerful and make a big impact which makes the basic shooting in the game (which is the core of the gameplay) feel fantastic. Its a joy to play and I had a blast. I played it in 4k with max settings and it looked better than I expected it to tbh." 
* Red Faction 1 - Well I played about half way through but theres a game breaking bug!  You can't enter the submarine at all.  It falls and crashes because the overhead release is on a frame count timer not a real time timer.  Apparently the open source Red Faction engine can play it and would let me finish.  I think I would like to because it was so good bitd and I had so much fun playing the first few hours.  
* Gauntlet Slayer Edition 12/18/19 - I beat this today!  I first played it a few months ago and it took me a while to get into but once I figured out the elf and the controls I've been having lots of fun.  I beat it on Easy.  Continue structure is perfect.  You can replay any level and you have to unlock the next levels by beating one of the current levels.  When you die you have to wait a few seconds and then you can respawn in exactly the same location (at least on easy mode) the elf is a dual stick shooter and I had a blast. 
	- jan 14 2021 - Ive been playing again because its fun and cool and because I played on C64 and NES.  Ive been playing as a valkyrie and shes cool.  I actually think my 8bitdo has a problem though!  its the sf30 pro and whats weird is when I'm trying to move up and left the player moves just slightly slower than in any otehr direction.
* Hellbound Demo - 12/18/19 - I've played for 53 minutes and in my last game I beat it in 16 minutes (par was <2 but thats ok) and I loved it.  Its the same formula as doom but with updated graphics and shooting that are wonderful and with a really interesting map.  Interesting to me in the perfect way: finding keys finding the best way to come at the enemies to get the drop on them and not have them overwhelm you and unlocking doors to find the exit.  I loved it.  
* Project Warlock Arctic Attack - 12/18/19 - I liked this ok but I feel like I am supposed to like it more.  I loved the great retro look and feel.  it felt big and scary and intense and interesting, but having just played hellbound I dont know ...I'm not done and plan to play it some more and wouldn't be ashamed to buy the full version.
* Out Run 3D 3DS - 12/26/19 - This is really good. the controls are great and well mapped and I dont feel cheated by them.  I think I'm doing something wrong though because I am not making any big mistakes and still can't beat the second leg.  I get close every time.  I'll keep trying.  The 3d is fantastic.  I can't tell whether the continue structure is good here because it seems like you can select your leg but I don't see that working unfortunatley so that may just be for fastest times on that leg.  This is really cool.  You can change the settings to make it pretty easy.  Now I can just tap the brakes and beat it in a few minutes with ending A
  - I love the 3D and smooth sprite scaling and cool environments.  This is one of the best racing games ever.  
  - Splash wave!
  - It seems to have an upgrade system of some sort which compels you to play it and beat it even at the easier levels
  - Today 3-5-2020 I beat it on Two star difficulty and got the second ending where the car falls apart 
* Space Harrier 3D 3DS - 12/27/19 - This is really good. The controls are great with the pad or the dpad, but also there are touch controls which use the stylus which I think would work really well possibly better than the mouse on the Amiga port.  The graphics are arcade perfect and better than any port including Amiga.  The sound and music is great, and theres a level select when you unlock them!  Thats awesome!  That fixes the continue structure.  You only get 3 lives per level but thats ok thats a fair challenge (at least at this point on these earlier levels - could be a problem later but I dont know).  And the 3d is fantastic! 2-28-2020  - Not only is the 3D fantastic but the quality of life features are top notch.  Adjustable lives and difficulty, level select, save and load, replay save, saved high scores.  It's really great! - It's also got music playback in the menus which is great because the music is great  Update: 6/1/2020 I got it working on Citra and boy is it amazing in VR. I love it so much.  its pure fun!  Caveats: Theres no level select in this version.  the controls are good because using my xbox I can use the dpad and stay exactly where I left it instead of pulling back to center every time.  the scaling is amazing and the depth is so damn cool.  I love being able to see such clear detail on teh sprites.  I got to level 7 or 8 before I probably left autofire down too long and cancelled out of putting in another quarter (or maybe I ran out of continues!?!)  I've been playing on Easy and would like to experience the whole game on this VR sometime soon.  Its just great.  I tried playing it on the japanese 3ds rom and that one was slow as hell and wasn't close to playable.  I was nervous about the USA one but it works great.  7/17/2020 - I beat it in VR and it is so cool and so much fun.  Why do I like it so much? I think I'll describe that in the Virtual Reality note
  
# 2020 Games #
* Mickey Mouse Land of Illusion Game Gear 1/8/2020 - I got to the second or third level, its cool that theres an overworld map and its got a good continue structure with apparently unlimited continues.  On tihs level theres a bunch of clunky underwater controls and its prety unforgiving and makes it not too much fun.  I was hopingto have more fun with it and its not too hard and I know I could beat it I'm just not motivated.  I think it would have been great bitd.  
* Devilish GG 1/8/2020 - This is a weird game with breakout controls.  I dont like it but I did have a game on DS called Class Action Devilish I think and I made some decent progress in that one.
* Double Dragon GG 1/8/2020 - Well this is so weird, its nothing like any of the other versions you can move up and down but its real clunky and its sort of more like a side scrolling platformer.  Its weird and not that fun but it might have been plenty of fun bitd.
* Double Dragon SMS 1/8/2020 - I remember wanting this when one of my friends was over and I asked my dad to go get it for us so we could play it on a sleepover and he did and it was super fun.  I think we beat it or got to the end and had a blast.  The graphics are shiny and clear and really discrete.  It looks great.  
* Power Strike SMS 1/8/2020 - Its pretty fancy with all of the 8 way controls and stuff.  I didnt love it though.  
* Sonic SMS 1/8/2020 - The graphics are great and theres an overworld which is pretty cool.  I would have loved this if I had bought it although I would have continued to be jealous of the genesis version.  The graphics are great.  the enemy sprites are small but everything is clear and the shading is great like the trees and grass hanging over the edge.  The controls actually feel fantastic. Maybe better than the Genesis.  it looks like you get the chaos emeralds by finding them hidden in teh levels.  The continue structure kind of sucks though.  On interesting quirk is you can't collect your rings when you get hit. One thing that means is on bosses you get one hit.  I wish I had bought it bitd.  Even before nintendo.  I was just sure though that it was a cheaper version of the genesis game which I saw as such graphical and technical perfection that I knew this wouldnt live up to that level and I thought this would actually be much worse than it is.  Its great.  Alright!  Ibeat the first boss and released a bunch of cute bunnies and birdies!  I also loved that about the original genesis game:  You were saving the enemies not killing them and you saved a bunch at the end of the level.  it made me feel really good.  The level 2 theme is really catchy.  You know what the platforming gets too hard a few levels in where you have to jump onto a little log from far away.  The waterfall level is one of those silly situations where if you advance the screen 1 inch above the ground hit box then you die if you land back on the ground.  The whole waterfall level is kind of crappy because of it being so unforgiving on the perfect platforming and some of the platforms dont land right which gets really frustrating.  Ok 3rd boss down using some save states and a bit of rewind.  Now I'm in Labyrinth zone.  The slowdown in the water level was pretty crappy and the slow sonic underwater platforming is not that fun.  Looks like I'm about half way through.  One weird thing is the spikes have horrible sloppy and unfair collision boxes.  I like this idea for making games easy: If its a kaizo trick that I couldn't have seen coming then rewind is ok.  I just beat it!  It was pretty fun and pretty short and I would have liked it as a kid.  I wonder though if I could beat it without save states.  The last words in the game are "Presented by Sega   End"  And it locks up which is kind of funny :) 
* Space Harrier GG 1/8/2020 - Continue structure is great because it has limited continues but then gives you a short password!  The gameplay is pretty terrible and the graphics are too super chunky with unmasked sprites  :(
* Sonic Game Gear 1/8/2020 - This version is pretty close to the master system version but a few differences: I think the invincibility sphere is smaller which intrigues me about the size of the sprites.  Its just barely as big as sonic in a ball not nearly as big when hes walking.  In the master system one the sphere is just as big as the player.  
* Gleylancer - 1/8/2020 - This is amazing.  There are so many cool things about this the graphics, ships, playability, collision, shooting powerups, controls (which there are 6 options for controlling your sidearms).  I beat the first level with just a few rewinds.  Its really great. I tried it without rewind and didnt make it through the first level.  It doesnt actually start you over at the beginning when you die ther are invisible checkpoints.  Lets try it again.  The high score entry is one of the coolest Ive seen.  Theres a very tricky part at the end of world 1 where you are supposed to not go after a powerup or you will die.  Its so tempting and I'm sure theres a very tricky way when you have ltos of skills to do it but you have to be very good and plan ahead.  Continue structure seems great.  YOu have a few lives to beat the level and then unlimited cotninues if you don't starting you at the beginning of that level.  Also it asks if you want to cahnge your shot type.  I did it with 3 ships left!!! Hey I nearly beat the next level in one life!  This game is really really good.  The collision on the ship is just perfect.  Its all very fair and fantastic.  The weapons are so cool.  The levels are amazing.  I love this so much.  This level I'm on now has a boss which closes you in to a tiny space and I haven't beaten it yet even after getting there like 10 times.  Lets see if I can do it with rewind.  Yeah i can beat it without too much trouble with rewind.  Ok after many more tries I finally beat that boss just now with only save states but not with rewind.  I am on level 11 now with rewind through the previous few levels and its great.  I love how the big enemies change color when hit, The palette changes to brighten them up its not an external glow but it looks great and is an excellent representation of them being hit.  Beat it!  I dont honestly think I could have beat the last few levels without rewind, but its still one of the fairest shooting games I've played.  its great.  
* Streets of Rage 2 - 1/8/2020 - This is a pretty good beatemup with small sprites but actually really great combat.  Its really fun punching in this game where thats not always true.  
* Hybris - 1/8/2020 - Hybris this has a great trainer which lets you start on any stage.  I'm playing on the mac on FS-UAE with an ADF.  I've played 2 games and havent gotten very far.  I'm using the trainer that lets you have all 5 powerups when you start, but honestly its really hard not to lose them quickly. Alright!  After trying many time s(probaly 7) II completed the first boss and stage! I'm proud!  I didnt have any lives left though but  its very fun!  Lets try it wihtout the trainer.  The continue structure is great! It lets you continue unlimited from the beginning of each stage.  Thats awesome imho.  Update: Its got credits on the first screen .. does that mean it only gives you on econtinue???  I love this game.  Continues seem unlimited and even better they dont start you off at the beginning of the level.  Thats wonderful!  The continues are only to get highscore it looks like.  Its so fun.  I got to level 2 fairly with no save states and on many legit cotninues.  Maybe 100 retries with save states and continues and I finally beat level 2.  I have no idea how I could beat some of these enemy patterns without save states.  One of the hardest ones are guys that come out of the side you're not nearest to at points near your vertical position and then fly in and shoot and then dip slightly randomly making it hard to avoid them and there are many of them really hard to dodge or shoot.  I would like the plane to be faster honestly.  
* SWIV - 1/8/2020 Amiga - I had this game aand loved it so much. I got pretty far (for me) and I played it again a week or two ago for my amiga project.  The ADF has lots of cool trainer options like lives and autofire.  I'm using unlimited continues, and autofire and spread missiles.  Doing it this way you are effectively invincible so its fun but not that fun.   To get it to run I had to use some 1MB chip ram and PAL mode and auto resolution and Kickstart 1.3 A500.  I beat the first big gun boss with unlimited continues
* Fantasy Zone - 1/8/2020 SMS - This sucked because there are no continues and the 2nd boss is silly difficult.  Getting a nupgrade would help but that shouldnt be required to just beat a boss because then you lose it and have to grind to get another upgrade but you cant count on it.  You can't be sure you will win if you make any mistakes.  that kind of unforgivness is silly imho.
* Golden Axe - 1/8/2020 SMS - This is so good.  I remember buying this and loving it because I could actually beat it once or twice.  I felt so accomplished. I really wanted it to have more characters and be two player but as it was it was super fun and looked great and played even better.  THe jump over the pit is still stupid and cheap and shouldnt be there.  having that there means your whole game can be ruined by a few tiny errors and having to learn techniques that you otherwise dont need to know or care about.  The player moves faster in this game which is nice.  Its not cheap in terms of your reach.  I beat it just now and got an A but I was using some rewind and I remember getting a really bad score bitd but at least I won!  I never felt like I had really mastered it because I didnt get a good grade.  
* Streets of Rage 2 - 1/8/2020 Gen - This is really cool game. The fighting is near perfect. the enemies arent cheap on normal mode (Until you get to zamza the level 3 boss).  I beat level 3.  There are lots of rom hacks which let you play as other characters or a few different fighting features or the ninja turtles!  The wrestler ABADEBE is much less cheap than the ZAMZA blanka like boss. The continue structure sucks.  2 continues and thats it.  Options menu lets you select 5 lives per continue but thats not enough to be a fair challenge for non-experts.  R. Bear is cheaper than even ZAMZA.  I lost 4 lives on him the third time I tried.  Its pretty long too so it gives a lot of content for this one game.  Its great but I am a bit bored honestly.  1/11/2020 I beat stage 7 without using save states and with just a bit of rewijnd.  I lost like 3 lives.  One lame thing is fi you run out of time you lose a life.  Stage 8 clear with lots of rewind and one more continue - 5 lives left.  I beat it!  Hey the credits song is really catchy and fun.  This is a great game.  Interesting: in openemu with the ds4 attached as bt and wired I was able to somewhat control two characters at one time since it saw them as separate controllers.  if I can get that trick working more reliably I think it mmight be fun to play two at once and just not pay attention to both. 
* The adventures of square - 1/10/2020 Doom Mod - This is really fun to play through with the puzzles being interesting and reminding me of Overload for PC if that is possible and the shooting being fun and controls being great.  I'm re-learning FPS controls on controller so I can play on the couch.  This is a really good game.  One cool thing about this game is you can download it on its own as a standalone game.  
* Space Hunter Doom Mod - 1/10/2020 - I'm having the best time playing through the Doom2 levels with the space hunter mod because the shooting is more fun imho.  its pretty easy as doom mods go but its still hard enough to be interesting for me.  I get lost pretty easy and the puzzles are interesting for me plus surviving is too.  I'm having to re-learn palying FPS games wiht the ps4 controller.  Its a really good mod.  Ive played through several full map sets with this and I personally significantly prefer it to the standard gun set.  
* Doom 2 - 1/12/2020 I'm playing the DOom 2 maps with the space hunter mod and these maps are a bit weird but also awesome. I'm spending 30-45 minutes solving the puzzles which makes me feel a bit stupid but I am not beating myself up too much I'm just having to lookin every nook and cranny.  I dont think the keys should be hidden in secrets I have to look at the map to find secret areas to find the keys and exit but I feel like I should be able to explore everywhere visible to find the keys and exits.  I found a secret to go to a wolfenstein level!  It was pretty cool!  In one case on the suburbs level the exit is so secret that you have to hit a secret unlabeled column, but if you hit it from the wrong angle (i.e. any of the flat sides like every other door in the game) the column moves but the door doesnt open.  If you hit it from the right angle then it opens the door  you need.  Tenements was frustrating. I loved exploring every nook and cranny its always fun, until I got to a point where I didnt know where to go even looking at every littl eline on the map.  finally After looking in the same place 4 times I had flipped some switch or opened some wall somehow to let me finally reach the exit.  It took 45 min total and was frustrating for probably 20 of those.  I played it again and it took under 15 min.  Par was 7 min.  I'm pretty happy with 15min, but I feel like trying it again. First time was just under 47 min, second time under 15, third time under 10, fourth time I beat par!  6:57!!!
* Doom the Way Id DId DTWID - Therea re a lot of good maps here probably slightly better than d2 imho.  e3m7 is a  masterpiece imho.
* Hard Reset - 1/17/2020 - I just started this game and I love it. The shooting and graphics are really satisfying and exciting and the enemies are scary.  I actually love the graphics.  I like that there are upgrades and that you are encouraged to use the environment to destroy your enemies.  I like that there are fair checkpoints.  The mouse user interfaces on the in game computers actually work really well and I like the puzzles which so far are just right for me.   They don't have me looking all over for a long time but are also non-obvious.  Its cute how since you cant crouch in the game they cover impassible gates with half a grate on the top half so it would physically be easy to crawl under but you know in the game you can't.  I really like this game.  I encountered a bug in the parking garage where I killed all enemies but the gate wouldn't open.  It took several tries to do it in the first place but I had to restart the checkpoint (by turning off the game) and then when I beat them again several tries later I was able to get through.  One thing I dont love is you can't play each level from any moment.  You can only continue from the checkpoint or restart the level you are on or just beat.  This is not a big deal but it would be nice to be able to go back somehow and retry each level.  If I were trying to get through a game using speedruns or get fastest scores or speed I would want that feature.   Wow I love the first huge boss the Atlas.  Hes so big and awesome and a fun battle.  As soon as I got to the second boss (the big crawly thing on buildings) gosh it got way harder.  Many encounters after seems to be harder too.  I spent like an hour on that boss, and the next major encounter is multi faceted and taking a really long time too.  The waves of enemies in this part aren't really matching the environment not giving me enough cover from these types of enemies.  Some of the enemies (specifically the flying ones) are not fun because its not clear when you have hit them and they dodge your shots, and its not clear how to even consistently hit them and they take way too many hits and theres no way to take real cover from them and not take damage.  11h later I beat it and this is a great game.  I loved it.  Beat it on 1/24/2020
* Soul Calibur VI - 2/1/2020 - I love this so much.  the music is amazing and even goes into a hobbiton kind of song when you go into a town.  I love the adventure mode and the character creation and all of the different quests and stories you get in this mode. played 3 hrs last night and 1.5 today.  Its so fun and cool.  I got into a match that was 15 levels over mine (45-30) and it took probably 15 min but I finally won and learned some new skills on the way.  Its so good.  haha Azwel said "How dare you interrupt me mid-monologue".  This game does a fantastic job of training you on the major combat features by putting you in different scenarios where the only way out is to learn it enough to beat an opponent who without that technique is impossibel to beat.  I spent like 10 tries on Ivy before I got good enough at anticipating her moves (shes got some mean combos that keep you far away and take down your soul meter).  Thej ending to the story is cool and doesn't jsut dump you into the credits.  I like that there is some dialogue after the final boss battle. 

* Kirby Planet Robobot 3-31-2020
  - Stage 2 - the robot stuff here is so cool
  - Stage 4 patched plains - the perspective at the beginning is so cool!
  - This first clanky woods battle is really cool with several parts!
  - 2-2 is a cool shmup ina. City with an absolutely awesome boss.  I would absolutely play a full game like this
  - 2-4 is a cool casino background hey and it's the cool 3D pool table level great fun catchy tunes
  - 3-4 has a cool snowmen heads you have to fill with ice and amazing creamsicle ice cream swirl cones falling on you
  - Overload ocean stage 5 has a really cool 3D background and foreground thing going up and down a lot which is awespme
  - Gigabyte grounds 3 has a cool Rube Goldberg machines
  - Gigabyte grounds 5 is a great shooter with great 3d
  - 4-3 2020
  - Rhythm route 2 - huge pool balls in the front layer
  - Access ark 4 is awesome!  The environment is so damn cool
  - The credits can be punched!  The whole final boss battles series is cool with great forgiving continue structure and let's you load up on power ups before each boss if you die
  - I beat it on 4/15/2020 and it's really cool
  - It unlocks a really cool speed run Survival mode called Meta knight mare mode which has a great bat mechanic that I love flapping those wings
* Mario 3D land
  - 2-4 has a Mario 1 theme even to the point that there's and end sectionnthays awesome for 3D Mario 1
  - 5-3 is like a Zelda dungeon with secrets and the Zelda sound and all
  - 3-4 water level let's you get a fireflpwer
  - In 5-2 there's a bonus room with a 1up near the top left and a fireflpwer below it some
    - 5-2 has a cool place at the beginning where you can jump up and into the camera
    - And a hidden fireflpwer at the beginning
  - 5-4 is pretty good for 1ups and a fire flower
  - 5-5 has a ton of 1ups in a stack of goombas
  - 6-3 has a really cool piano level
* Altered beast 3D classics 2-29-2020
  - The 3D is fine
  - There is local Wireless multiplayer!
  - It should have more difficulty options.  It doesn't even have unlimited continues which blows my mind
  - At least it has save states
  - I wonder if the non Japanese version is different with continues?
  - 
* Sonic 3DS 3D classics 2-29-2020
  - There's a built in level select which I think is wonderful
  - Then there's a save and load 
  - And some great 3D options where it's full 3D layers going in or popping out a bit and also an option to be flat but on an old school 3D curved CRT 
  - I got through the third stage on just 2 lives including the boss!
  - 4-11 I got through labyrinth zone on 3 lives but couldn't beat the boss.  I could only hit him twice.  I bet there's a strategy but so far I don't like this boss 
  - 4-19  I got through whole labyrinth zone on 3 lives in fact lost one and gained one so ended up with 3!
  - 4-20 I got through labyrinth zone Again and then beat star light with 1 remaining
  - Man this game is so damn cool.  I never owned a genesis as a kid but I thought it was the coolest damn thing It was super high tech making all these amazing 3D (appearing due to parallax) graphics and amazing beautiful sounds.  I thought the volume on the console was wicked so you could play in private and I thought the curves were out of this world.  It was so cool.  This was over before I knew anything about SNES (and before it was released)
  - I rented sonic at least twice (which also meant I had to rent a genesis which I remember being $15 for the weekend)
  - I remember not getting very far and getting pretty frustrated.  I think if I had really just played it a little bit every day I would have eventually beat it
  - The last time I remember renting it I remember getting to world 2-1 but not getti much further.  That's about as far as I typically got back in the day.  
  - I never figured out how the chaos emeralds worked only once or twice ever got one didn't know how to activate the bonus levels (for me it seemed totally random to get the big ring actually I think I thought you had to be moving fast when Th e level ended) I never got any good at the bonus levels and never realized that those emeralds were something worth collecting and I don't know if I could have anyway.  Actually I'm not sure I ever got entirely though the border surrounding the chaos emeralds
  - So I didn't get many one ups from the bonus stages and in the regular stages I wanted to go really fast and felt like if I'm playing this game right I'll be able to speed through each of the levels but I know now that's not the case
  - That's also why level 2-1 puzzled me there's no way to go fast
  - If I had owned it or had more patience with it I could have beat it because now on 4-20 I got through labyrinth with 4 lives remaining and The next world all three levels and boss with 1 lives remaining
  - I remember that last time I rented it something weird happened in my brain.  I found a trick in a magazine like start plus a or something when on the title screen and it sent me to a level select!  Today I have one on my 3DS built into the game but back then I didn't know what to think of it.  I tried a few random levels and died quickly and finally I tried the final boss and it was really cool seei Ng the final boss but of course I died quickly several times and had to start over.  After thAt though ... I felt different about the game.  I felt like I had (inexplicably I know) seen or mastered the whole game or some feeling like that and I had much less desire to play it anymore.  There were two aspects as far as I could tell: 1.  Now I could play any part of the game all of the difficulty was removed (even though I hadn't beaten all but like 4 it felt that way) and 2. I felt like I had pretty much beaten or unlocked or experienced all it had to offer.  It's weird in hindsight but that was in my head and I still held it in high esteem but didn't want to play it so much anymore. 
  - In 2003 I played it again on DC or Xbox and remember thinking how stupid the 2nd world was how you couldn't go fast at all. That's kind of how I felt about the game until recently.
  - Spring zone zone 3 has the best music in the game imho the second part of the music is so catchy and cool and interesting and fun.
  -  the pinball parts In this game we're so bad ass because they were better more fun momentary pinball action (the bouncing and sounds and stuff) than any other game I'd played outside of an actual pinball machine.  They made it feel super modern to me like a game within a game and I loved thay
  - I remember one of the most stressful things in SMB was the situations where you had to perform the Difficult action perfect there was no way to get around it there was no safety net or backup plan.
  -   In most situations in SMB there was a safety net at least in design because In most situations you can be in control of whether you are large and then if you get Hit you just go small.
  - For most jumps it would be if You Jump too late you die but if you jump a bit too early that can be ok so you don't have to perform perfect ther is wiggle room.  Or if you undershoot you die but if you overshoot You land safely
  -   There were some big jumps that didn't give you any safety net tho like on I think 8-2 or 4-3 where there's a big leap where you have to run over a little gap and then land on a single block and then quickly jump again while still running.  It's pretty easy for me now but bitd that was very difficult and scary because you knew that there was no way to get into that situation and not have to perform perfectly to beat it
  - Well sonic has a lot more situations where you have to perform perfectly to beat them.  Instant kills and unforgiving jumps and movements.  You have to make the jump just right and if you don't well not only do you have to backtrack but you are often hit or killed and sometimes thrown into lava or knocked back down a cliff
  - Something I just noticed consciously but I think I knew subconsciously in the past is that in some ways the Mario games are faster.  No the character doesn't actually move faster, but the levels are designed with generally less waiting and more left to right so you can run more than many of the sonic levels where you have to take it real slow and careful
  - Sometimes like on 2-2 the checkpoint can be behind you or out of the normal path which I don't feel like Mario does to you
  - Also the bricks in the second world aren't as beautiful of a sexy checkerboard they aren't as clean or modern as the bricks on the first level
  - As of 4-20 I've had this cart for about 4 yrs (since 2016 at the latest) and first played this game in 1990 but right now learning it and getting really good at it level by level with its beautiful sexy Ultra modern in 90s Graphics plus the incredible 3D parallax thay I love so much is one of the funnest and most satisfying gaming experiences of my life.  I'm loving it
  - Update 6/2/2020 I got this working in Emulation and gods is it amazing!  It pulls me into the green hill zone like I've never been able to be there with so much depth and I can see every pixel huge and its like Sonic is the size of a dog which is so damn cool.  I made it so deep it gave me a bit of motion sickness haha.  I love it.  Update 6/14 have to have new 3DS emulation on and no graphical filters or anything.  The sound isnt absolutely perfect frankly just almost imperceptibly skippy.  citra nightly 1554
* New Super Mario 2
  - I love this!
  - One thing I don't love is how it blurs when the 3D is deeper.  I understand why they did that and it's a cool enough feature but I wish you could just turn it off.  I like to be able to focus on whatever i want at any depth and this doesn't let me.  Yeah it's more realistic but it's less interesting to my eyes and brain and heart
  - I don't love how you have to beat a castle to save
  - They give you lots of one up opportunities at least
  - 1-4 has some cool ways to get one ups
  - 2-4 there's a pipe where you goomba jump for unlimited
  - 2-midcastle great place for leaves
* Kid Icarus Uprising 3D
  - Wow here are some of the reasons why this is one of the best games ever made
  - Adjustable difficulty every time you start a level With a transparent user interface to do so
  - Amazing integrated tutorial
  - Easy to replay levels
  - Great full length game
  - Amazing 3D graphics
  - Great Unique controls Which work great
  - Part of the game is like space harrier
  - Amazing narration
    - Great voice acting
    - Teaches you things
    - Breaks the fourth wall sometimes with pixelated jokes like the 3 headed dragon
  - It plays a funny song when reapers see you that seems totally out of place but it's from the NES game!
  - Huge beast bosses
  - Exciting flying
  - Shows you direction to go in
  - Hearkens to the old game with most of the same enemies and power ups and bosses and even the music 
  - The bickering hydra heads are hilarious 
  - The game has somewhat of a teen anime sense of humor
  - I suck at this game.  The intensity slider has to be low or I die.  I still don't know how to avoid the metroids while flying I've basically never avoided one.  There are lots of secrets I have no idea how to get. Like on level 3 or 4 there's a pit that has a partial ring around it that looks like it needs to be rotated or something to get to the other side where there's a treasure chest.  I can't figure itnout
  - Level 5 is a really cool futuristic low poly world with tons of voice acting character and some really brilliant And interesting level designs
  - Chapter 6 has a great Spanish guitar song and a pretty large intricate level
  - This game is a must buy if you have any interest in how cool the 3D can be on this system.  It's the best example and it would be a great AAA game on any system even without the stereo
  - Spoiler Alert One of these levels was like the final battle but then when I beat it the credits started rolling but then a worse boss interrupted them and the game started again :)
  - On level 10 I got turned into a shrimp and eaten
  - On 11 it's a scary nuclear bomb!
* 3D Gunstar Heroes
  - It was so cheap at like $5.99 and so good
  - I beat the first stage on my first try
  - It's forgiving the way I've got it set I set it easy mode and with double life I think
  - I would have died without that double life but I wonder how far back I would go or how many lives I have.  I wonder about the continue structure
  - The 3D is actually really great I've got it in pop out mode but it does take more eye adjusting than most of the games I've played on here 
  - I think that makes it pop more but there's a side border for both eyes that's visible 
  - I've gotten through most of the other levels without more than a couple retries and now I'm on probably stage 6 a horizontal shooter level
  - The 3D parallax when you're on the Spaceship is really cool and the rotating power station boss is awesome! This would have blown my mind if i ever could have gotten to it bitd 
  - The last boss rush was tough but still only took me a few tries.  This mode is super fair.
  - I'm really proud that I beat this game.  It's so good
  - The ending cinematic was fun and even slightly touching they included some emotion.  I loved it!
  - I have no idea if I ever would have been able to beat this bitd. 
  - It does seem to have unlimited continues and the final boss for example it starts you right there and even gives you a weapon upgrade 
* About 3ds
  - This is the first stereoscopic system and the tech is really cool!  It's hard to imagine how it even works!  
  - It is unique because it won't be around forever and once the displays are dead they basically can't be replaced.  You will still be able to play the games but in 2030 you'll be able to play ps3 wii nds switch even NES but it's not certain you'll be able to play 3DS
* BlasterMaster Zero 3DS
  - Demo
  - Not stereoscopic
  - Area 1 and 3 available
  - Seems to be unlimited lives and checkpoints everywhere
  - Controls are tight and the game is just like NES!
  - The music is epic and Deeply reminds me of playing NES games
  - Weird thing about the colors is underground whether 2d or 3D when you're moving the brown background blurs in such a way that the whole screen seems to go dark.  It's distracting and disconcerting 
  - The overhead areas are cool but I don't think they could have been done on NES. They have parallax and are SNES worthy.  Update: the nes overhead areas looked amazing for the time with a huge character.  These look better but wow!  Nice work sunsoft!
  - I beat the boss of area one!  This is a really fun game!  It took Only three tries and there was a checkpoint immediately before
  - I got an upgrade to my gun!
  - I like how the two modes control so differently
  - It was cool that once I got my new weapon I could go to a few new sections of the same large map that I couldn't get to before and that in face those weee the only places left to go really once the boss was beat
  - Great game
  - Not special on 3DS.  The steam version has some co op gameplay!  Wow the switch version has that feature too!!  Nice!  The co op is a crosshairs for the second player to shoot the enemies like operation wolf or something.  That's really cool!  Or in boss mode it's kind of pvp
  - I had much fun with area 1 so I think I'll play area 3 too.  (Update: no I didn't end up enjoying 3 tonight anyway) I don't know but I don't think I'll buy this but who knows it's clearly fantastic and worth it :). I suspect I found this back when I was looking for Metroidvanias
  - Apparently there's a second game this one from 2017 and the new one from 2019 
* Leander
  - Amiga
  - 4-6-2020
  - Escape quits losing all lives with no continue and no mercy!
  - In my cracked version I have unlimited bombs and coins but not life (I could have selected life but didn't)
  - You can select twin button joystick
  - You can pick how many lives (Max 5) and credits (Max 3) you get and the difficulty of the game in the options
  - I really wish you could go down through platforms to lower platforms 
  - There is a password to split you through the game by thirds so you have 5lives with 3 continues to beat a third of the game 
  - 4-7-2020
    - I played for many hours and had much fun
    - I got pretty good
    - I don't understand the weapon upgrades
    - The dragon on 1-3 or 4 is far too brutal
    - I found a big problem because due to some copy protection I couldn't beat level 1-4
    - A platform just didn't exist
    - And I couldn't get any version that was rumored to work to actually work on my Mac uae fsuae 
    - And I tried a lot
    - It was all depressing because I wanted to keep playing
    - Next day I got another version working and had fun
    - I got a sword upgrade so it was more fun
    - I think I accidentally also was invincible
    - But I got through the first 4 levels pretty quick probably 45min
    - Then I got through the rest of world 1!
    - The jumping on flying bags was silly. It requires such perfect timing that I think it should be much more forgiving
    - In the beginning of world 2 I found a part where I had to jump on a platform which floated up from spikes but the timing was so carefully critical that it wasn't so much fun anymore
    - Continue Structure: 5 lives, 3 continues. Each life you start off right where you were.  Each continue you start at the beginning of the stage (1.3, 2.4, whatever).  Thats not too unfair.  You lose your weapon when you get hit or die (not sure which)
    - Hey If you have the infinite lives password in and then hit F8 the game pauses and then hold F6 and hit the fire button and it skips to the next level!
* Magic Pockets
  - I had some fun playing up to level 7 or 8 with heavy use of save states
  - 4-6-2020
  - Amiga
  - The power ups were too complicated and the enemies too sort of random (their powers and behavior weren't the same for a given enemy)
* Miles & Kilo
  - This is a cool game!  The continue structure is great and it lets you do as many continues and lives as you want
  - The 3D is subtle but I like it
* Kirbys adventure 3D classic
  - I like the 3d
  - The continue structure seems really good and lenient
* Professor Layton Azran 3DS Started Early April 2020
	- This is a pretty long game with a cool interesting fun story and great puzzles.   Well worth the money.  I like this a lot but its dragging on a bit for me, its lost a little bit of its shine. I'm more than half way through and I dont feel compelled to keep playing after Ive played for like 30 min at a time, which is ok of course.
	- Aug 6 I'm at the Jungle Waterfall and its funny that they are easily willing to risk death climbing a wall, karate kick an enormous boulder (which a human couldnt possibly budge), and upset an entire forest ecosystem so they dont get their hats wet haha.  I thought that was one silly thing but its not really a criticism of the game as a game or the story just really specifically that part :)  Inside the stalactite cave They dont mind destroying ten thousand years of mineral loveliness to make a bridge so they can pick some crystals. Then back at the village elders: "Aye thats from the Glutinus Maximus!" haha
	

* Chaos Engine
  - I read something that said that Navvie and Priest were the best duo
  - Had to do some controller configurations and while it wasn't hard it wasn't particularly user friendly
  - I beat level one without dying!  I never did that before!
  - Beat level 2 but died like 3 times
  - Very hard, its silly that continues dont restore your life.  you can't see enough of the screen to get anywhere without knowing whats coming in advance.  I still love it and wish I had bought it when I was a kid above and beyond most other Amiga games I should have bought this because I knew I would love it.  I think I felt some guilt that I hadn't caught up with all of the Amiga classics (at that point) I really didnt know what other games were out there.
  - Jan 14 2021
  - If this had unlimited continues I would so much love this game.  But theres no cheat for that :(  in the guide ni the steam community the author says that this version is superior because the game is saved after every level so you can retry one level at a time.  i mean thats true but its still far too picky.  Theres a HUGE life bar down at the bottom and you get one eighth of it to start?  So weird and unpleasant.  
  - I'm on the 4th level with no lives lost and full health but only by playing each level like 30 times to try to get through it with full health and no lives lost. 
  - For some reason when I fire it up today my controller works in the menu with the stick but then in game the keys are mapped to wasd and escape to fire??? how strange! 
  - whoa selecting leaderboards crashes the game!
  - ok a guide that I'm seeing says that theres an options menu when its not in fullscreen mode.  I thought there was something like that.  alt enter to switch to from fullscreen.  lets try it yeah it works great.
  - I activated 360 movement which means its easier to line up my shots which is nice since Im not just moving in 8 dir.
  - that bastard ai player STOLE my extra life!!!
* VROOM Galleon VR 4-18-2020
  - Expecting a game? You'll be disappointed
  - Expecting a pretty cool VR experience you'll have fun.
  - I played For 45 min or so and would like to play again sometime
  - The sharks were cool
  - The water was cool
  - The horizon was awesome
  - The eyeglass was cool
  - The fish bucket was AMAZING!
  - The mermaid was cool
  - The pirate city was cool
  - The hidden rooms On the ship were cooL
  - The dining room was cool
  - I liked it a lot and had a memorable experience
* Dungeon Warfare 5-10-2020 I bought this on iphone the other day for like $2.99 on Matei's recommendation (though he implied it would be no good on iphone) but damn this is an amazing game!  I think I will be able to beat it!  5-13-2020 I just got 1.5mil XP on one endless mode.  Its great fun even though I dont typically love strategy games I have really enjoyed tower defense games in the past and this one really hit home for me.
	- Update 12-16-2020 I beat it!  A few days ago I started playign this again and came up with some new strats, and I also figured out you can totally respec your gear.  I beat it though!  I palyed in may and then later in the year but When I left off a few months ago I thought I was going to have a hard time with the last level, and I did, but when I figured out I could makemillions by picking a level with a tight choke point and maxing out certain weapons it mdae things easier.  especially using the debuff bonuses and endless mode.  Its a great game.    I didnt eeven ever use half of the weapons.  Dart, Spike, Barricade (which had some cool upgrades), harpoon, Bolt, Inferno,Spinbalde, I basically never used any of the others many I literally never used.  This was one of the most satisfy ing strategy experiences ever (Guildmaster is number 1 ofc :) )
* Volgarr the Viking 5-22-2020 
	- I beat the first checkpoint of Volgarr the Viking today!.  its stupid hard and you know what ... it DOESNT LET YOU SAVE!?!?!?!  Apparently since I looked at the forums you can skip levels you've beaten before at least.  The checkpoints are really far away from one another.  But strangely since you have unlimited continues at checkpoints I really didnt feel cheated or frustrated.  It is super satisfying to play and they justify it by saying that the satisfaction you will get is enormous by beating it.  Now They also say this game you will remember the layout of the levels more than most any other game and I think they are right, but there is a fine line because some games like 3d games with huge sprawling levels I may remember them sometimes but only because they were simple shapes or because the level was incredibly too hard.  Otherwise though you just speed through games like that and people dont appreciate the work that went into your levels.  I like the idea of making it satisfyingly hard but also like the idea of letting people progress and not holding them back.  I think they should have documented the level skip in the tutorial and if so I think I would have given a thumbs up to this being a great example of a super difficult game with a great continue structure.  If it had limited lives I absolutely would have returned it. Update: Later today I beat the first level!  So proud!  So Satisfying!  And believe it or not they actually did document that level skip int he tutorial!  They just put it at the end of the level so you would only know about the trick once you beat the first level.  Its a magical game actually.  I'm very happy about it.  oh and you have to beat the first boss after beating the second harder half of the whole level (there are like 3 parts that I still dont have down to a science yet) the first boss is huge and incredible looking and the designers intentionally made the bosses and the screen after you beat the
* Nuclear Throne - 7/13/2020
	This is a cool game.  I love watching gears of games play this and I like it to a degree, I bought it because it looked so cool, but I ultimately do not like it.  I think it achieves its goals well and its a great game for what it is, but I dont like what it is.  I would like to play a game along the lines of worlds 1 and 2 for a very long time
* Lord of the Rings: War in the North - PC 7/25/2020
	- This is one of the coolest games I've ever played.  Elladan, Adriel and Farin.  I was thinking about ROTK on GBA which was a diablo clone and found out that this existed.  I wish I had known about this 10 years ago because I would have loved it.  But I love it now.  The lore is deep and the game is so well crafted.   the combat is fun and great.  I loved baldurs gate dark alliance 1 so much and that return of the king for GBA so this feels like a perfect followon.  the eagle looks freaking amazing.  The troll looks freaking amazing too.  And eladans armor and cloak.  Parts of this game look 5-10yrs ahead of when they were made.  I played for probably 5 hours today and its one of the best games I've ever played in a lot of ways.  
	- To get this working I had to switch my desktop to 1920x1200.  I have had virtually no crashes or problems since I did that.  At higher res it only ran for a few minutes.  Later I considered adding a patch someone made for disabling controller vibration because it is pronounced and not in the options of the game.
	- Parts of the game that I liked: This is an awesome epic tale which sets up the fellowship, takes you to Imladris, Barrow Downs, Radagast, meeting dragons, several dungeons we've never seen before, has you assaulting huge strongholds with thousands of warriors and flying nazgul, includes the eagles in the story and personifies some of them as heroes, has awesome huge spiders.  I love the assault on Mount Gundabad in the snow because it makes you feel like its really dangerous and like you must avoid getting caught.  This snow level would be so damn cool to look around in VR.  I'm glad theres no having to think about falling off ledges.  the game protects you from that.  The inside of Gundabad is so bad ass.  What a thrill it would be to go there or live there.  Wow the inside of Nordinbad is amazing too for totally differnet reasons.  I love the spider boss who is really scary and the cinematography there is excellent and makes the boss seem scary and the wizard seem dead and in terrible shape.  The huge dragon is really cool.  Radagast has poop in his beard but at least this time theres a possible explanation for it.  Its cute what Radagast says about badgers when Farin is confused :) Carn-dum is an awesome castle.  The ending is epic and I love how it aligns with the Lord of the Rings story and the dragon. I love how epic the story is how when you start it over it brings you back to the beginning and you feel like you've really been all over the world and you remember how when you first started, Bree felt big and new and the center of the world and when you had done your first quest it all felt so big at that time, and yet now given all you've been through Bree feels quaint and the first quest feels small compared to what you've done.
	- The continue structure is perfect. In each dungeon its totally fair where you get to a point and it lets you buy and sell in the middle and then you can even teleport back to your last town, and then teleport from there right back to where you left off in that dungeon.  Then you can play each level several times because there are many secrets to find.  There are also some side quests which encourage you to go to each place and look carefully, but the cool thing is they are also fair because if you're supposed to find 3 herbs they aren't hardcoded to a specific location they are randomly picked from all the herbs that you come across so as long as you keep finding herbs you will eventually find enough, it never becomes a chore where you can't find what you need.  I wonder if the dungeons are randomly generated?  I think maybe so and if so that adds to the replay value and you can go back to any dungeon you've already beat at any time.  Since there are 3 characters there is also reason to switch between them to keep it interesting and you can switch at many checkpoints or teleporters, probably when you start the game too.  Theres some shared inventory but I dont think equipment is shared which is good because they will each want their own collection for their own purposes.  Apparently theres also a hard mode.  I like that it gives you clues "there must be a lever to open this gate" and then when you get near the lever "There is a lever here" so you know to look for it.  When you beat the game it increases the difficulty and you can start over from the beginning and level up further and this way it lets you unlock the other roughly half of the powers in your skill tree (if you haven't replayed a bunch of dungeons already) becoming superpowered, and it lets you explore the world with all of  the three powerful characters, and it lets you find all of the secrets (which can only all be found by playing each level with the three characters (or at least the dwarf and the lore-master).
	- The voice acting and dialogue is great and like a movie. The voice acting sounds 90% like Gandalf, 70% like Aragorn, 70% like Gimli, 80% like Elrond, and 100% like Frodo.  It looks 99% like Frodo too, 85% like Gandalf and 65% like many of the rest.  Another detail is the freckles on the skin of the woman in the first side quest in bree were pretty striking and made her look incredibly realistic.    This game should have been huge for all LOTR fans.  I'm not only surprised I hardly heard of it, but I'm surprised it wasn't a really big deal.  I feel like I have heard of it but if you asked me what it was I would have said it was an RTS.  I think I remember hearing about this game and how it was a parallel story with an elf a man and a dwarf and I thought it was a cheap rip off or something.  Boy was I wrong.  Actually I think I just wanted it to be the exact story of lotr that I loved so much and wanted to live that tale.  I kind of think they should have made this game but with that exact story and this should have been some DLC for later.  Belaram the eagle looks freaking amazing and his voice acting is fantastic too and his mouth movements and animations are great in fact he might be my favorite character and the best voice actor in the game.  Baranthor the eagle in Imladris has an American accent which feels out of place although his acting is still top notch.  After starting it over when I was done I realized how well written this all is.  I understood all big picture ideas from the get go and never got lost in the story and it all seemed relevant and even important to do and like they were taking seriously the saving of the North of middle earth.  Most games and stories and books I have to read or experience several times to get it.  I guess I have an advantage since this is all based on something I know very very well so I've got a place in my mind for all of the new details, still for someone like me familiar with the existing lore this fits perfectly and strongly the first time which is impressive.
	- A few words were mis pronounced: Westernesse (westerneese)by the blacksmith in Imladris when you offer him those things you found.  I think Arwen or somebody said Athelas wrong.  I feel like the return of the king game (even on GBA) which had the movie music in it, was a really sweet touch that made me feel like I was in the movie.  Clearly this isn't the movie, but had the music woven more of the themes from the score into these original tracks I think I would feel more a part of Arda.  I'm intellectually ok with their choice though and it generally makes sense.  
	- Lore: I love the little details they added, like if you ask the blacksmith at Imladris what he is making he talks about how he is about to reforge Narsil!  Thats so cool that they thought to add that in here from this different perspective. I love how theyve woven this tale in with the lord of the rings saga letting it weave inand out and augment but not disrupt exactly what happened in the books.  I also love that when Gimli interviews Gandalf they talk about why not have the eagles fly the ring to mount doom!  they're actually addressing that possible plot hole in this.  Thats so cool.  Its cute how enamored Farin becomes with Arwen instantly and starts stumbling on his words.  Its like Gimli and Galadriel haha.  I love how respectful they are to the eagles, and how cool the eagles are in return for their help.  I love that this game deals with what happened in the north which isn't really detailed at all in the books. Also they say lots of little quips from the movies and books like "the warg that one hears is worse than the orc that one fears" and something about underestimating dragons in nordinbad.  little things like that are riddled throughout.
	- Beat it at 1:10pm on 7/27/2020 This is one of the coolest and best games I've ever played.  I kept playing and got through part of the first dungeon and was getting blown up so much by the energy bolts (instant death) and since I'd already seen virtually all of the content it lost much of its shine for me.  I was getting some super powerful weapons though which was really cool.
* Micro Mages 7/27/2020 PC
	- I love this.  I was able to beat the first level (2869 is the password for level 2) without using any continues.  Its a fantastic game. the controls are so solid and I bet it would be a blast with multiple players.  When y ou eventually continue it starts you at the first level of the world.  when I beat level 2 the password was 3645.  ok!  7/28/2020 After about 30 min I beat level 3 password 7641 .  7/30/2020 Whoa I just beat teh level 4-3 boss and now I'm on level 4-4 with one life and the same password!?!
* Shitty Quest 7/27/2020 PC
	- "Here's my knob" haha.  After solving some puzzles (which made us feel smart) we just now met someone special who announced who he is in an epic voice :slight_smile: That was tonight's session and my dad and me loved it so far.  
* Xenon Racer 7/27/2020 PC
	- This game got some bad reviews for being too silly difficult or actually just really unfair (as in opponents get suddenly way faster than you) at least on hard mode. I'm playing on easy and on the third race I had to try it several times to pass, the first two races I didnt do great but passed, but the third one you have to get 1st place in a time trial and the first leg is super hard and you have to take the corners just so fast, after htat you get more and more bonus time and its better.  So its weird imho that they made it so hard instead of making more races against easier opponents but with a softer difficulty curve.   Still the racing and drifting is great fun and the graphics are awesome.  I've spent a good half hour with it and have had fun the whole time so its worth the money for sure even if its not the most value for money ever.  By the 4th race I am in 8th place and 40 seconds behind and that was racing at my best.  I'll try a few more times and give up.  Interesting that it doesnt let you pick a car and get used to how that car handles which I think is a little bit insane.  Itmakes you try different cars and on this last one with tons of twisties it doesnt drift anything like the previous car and doesnt drift well at all imho.  lets hope I can pick another car somehow for this race. Now the car models are totally bad ass all of them.  I can pick a car on this 4th race but its not one of the ones I've raced with before.  Maybe one of the ones I can pick will be decent for this task.  Nope the 4th race in the easy mode of the game is so unfair hard it should be perhaps the last race in the hard mode.   I'm probably done with this but the racing was great and the graphics were great and controls and presentation was through the roof the AI's fairness balance and difficulty curve were pretty far off though.  The presentaiton is awesome because its like your car is lifted from a garage up into your livingroom on a circular fancy lift directly.  pretty awesome.
* Titanfall 2 7/27/2020 PC
	- Setting: Wow The intro video is amazing.   Anyway I'm in and the intro is so bad ass like the best scenes from an action movie.  The graphics in the intro level are so beautiful its a peaceful serene scene with amazing dramatic sun lit hall.  ITS COOL that they have a gauntlet which then sets the difficulty of the game based on how you do in that gauntlet.  thats really smart imho. This has a great lore which although entirely new to me is starting to make sense and doesn't need too terribly much background.  They are doing a great job of making it feel like being in a movie.  Wow the opening scene where you're falling and everything that happens on that planet is intense and exciting and really really cool and sad and scary too.  Now that I have a titan I love having it as my friend and companion.  This could wind up being a legendarily great game in fact its on course for that.  
	- Levels  The graphics and environments on this first level are spooky and also fresh kind of like a brighter predator.  I'm deeply into this story. I think its really cool that they tried to teach you about driving the titans but ran out of time and make clear that only a well trained pilot is supposed to get a titan, but then you get thrust into one out of necessity and you have to figure the shit out!  I think its cool how some abilities are only not active at first because the suit and helmet are calibrating to your movements and natural abilities and so you have to maneuver around to teach it  There are some awesome alien beasties on this planet too.  oMG that cute bot regarding a new weapon "I think you're in love" "Human love requires affection devotion respect and admiration ... conclusion I am 50% in love"
	- Gameplay: I love the wall-jump (always have in prince of persia too) and this one plays and controls great.  It looks like you can have two weapons and grenades it looks like if you have weapon f201(example) and you see another f201 on the ground you can't pickup ammo from the one on the ground, you swap them out to see which has more ammo in it which seems somewhat weird. Update I was mistaken about that. my bad.  The medium range rifling is really fun kind of like sniping and I'm doing great at headshots.  Theres lots of cover and places to hide so I can take my time and sneak and I like doing that.  This gameplay would be amazing for speedruns even in game, like a level could be about finding the best path of escape from an exploding time bomb and you can go generally straight or if you are skilled you can get a bunch of out of the way pickups.  When you die a checkpoint wasn't far behind which is awesome. I think its cool that you have to figure out how to platform and wall and double jump around to get through the levels to your goal.  It think its cool that it gives you the option to see where your target is in 3d space, and optionally with tab key which way to go next and also for each tricky platforming section you can optionally see a ghost do it before you do and its conceivable that your suit would do those calculations and use AR to show you through your mask.  I think thats pretty bad ass.  
	- Specifics: I had to get an Origin EA Account but apparently I already had one, but apparently they also timed out my login info so I had to reset password.   Pretty regularly the steam overlay pops up but I don't really know why ... shift tab?  thats not what I'm pressing is it?  No its not.  its popping up when I switch to windows (alt tab) switch back, push forward and hit shift to run.  I got to a place where I turned off a sludge pump and the game changed a lot, it went from a sneaking game to instantly have to run and jump in a clumsy area with tons of obstacles and enemies everywhere but also exploding mines that run at you. They introduced the exploding mines by sending 4 at you at once in close quarters where there is no where to run from them.  I think this part is cheap and should have worked up to this.  I think its a boss battle but its too steep of a change and less fun as a result.
	- Update 8/22/2020 Well I had for some reason forgotten about this game!  Its so good.  I fired it up again today.  Some new cool stuff: 1. the ziplines. 2. the wrist device they get off of anderson is so bad ass.  It makes for some amazing puzzles and could be a primary mechanic for a new game.  The puzzles are so great.  I didnt figure them out without seeing the runner do it because I didnt understand quite what the possibilities were which is a really cool puzzle when you get it and you think "How cool!"  And a few hours later after some really intense shit I beat it!  That was one of the most thrilling cinematic and high budget productions I've ever played or seen.  I loved it so much.  I noticed that now I can play in some kind of multiplayer matches, and I also noticed I can like play any chapter of the campaign and try to find all of the helmets, and it looks like I beat it on normal mode I can probably do a hard mode. 
* Ninja Gaiden 8/4/2020
	- Well after watching Guten play this game I've been itching to play it and finally beat it.  
	- History: Back in the day I rented this and played it in the bedroom next to the computer room probably 1990-91 and I was trash but I still thought it was cool.  All my friends said it was great so I felt inferior when I really couldn't get anywhere.  I didnt know any platforming control tropes except some mario (and not much) nor did I know anyone to talk about the game with or call to talk about it, nor did I have any magazines, nor did I know that I could possibly go get a mag for this game (which wasnt really possible during any given month, you had to get kind of lucky to find the guide for the game you were playing on the newsstands or at a bookstore) nor was there any internet, nor did I even consider calling a 900 number even if I knew it existed, so I was on my own.  If there was a manual I dont remember it, and sometimes back then they were abbreviated copies of the manuals for rentals.  Further I probably felt inferior because I had an image in my mind that games were supposed to allow you to make progress, thats what I had seen in arcades (albeit with unlimited quarters) and it never really occurred to me that games would be made intentionally hard such that a new player would have lots of trouble even on stage 1 or 2, but thats what a lot of games were really like for new gamers, and since I felt like I was an expereinced gamer (having had an atari for years and having played NES at a friends house before most others even though I had never really put in any serious time with any game) I felt like I should be better than I was at this game.  It wasn't a hard game in my mind since all my friends loved it and games didnt come that hard, and I was good at games so logically I should be good at this game.  Illogical and unfounded beliefs of a 12yo aside this game and others at the time made me feel inferior, not good, less than my friends and everyone else who played games, and unworthy.  All of this is bizarre in hindsight but that is what was in my head and heart at the time.  
	- I also thought if any kids said a game was difficult, I thought that meant that you would make tons of progress and have a really fun experience for hours and be totally immersed in the story, but that later in the game something would show up that was hard to do but that would be after I had had tons of immersion in the land and the lore and after I had enjoyed myself for hours.  Ignoring that I probably thought that I being a superior gamer would be able to beat it easily even if it was hard, The difficulty curve for games like this was steep and immediate for a new gamer kid, and I didn't have weeks to spend honing my skills I had a handful of hours when I wasnt doing familly things or eating or at church or doing homework over the course of a weekend.  my time was limited and I really wanted to enjoy the lore and the story and mmake progress and see and experience the landscapes and story and challenges and graphics and interesting enemies and weapons that the game had to offer, and my experience simply didnt happen that way. 
	- If I had someone to talk to about it things might have been different, and when I say that people said it was hard this was a handful of conversations that i had been peripheral to or overheard, I didn't have a nintendo so if there were conversations I was only tangential because I had very little to add and I had very little context in which to place what was being said.  
	- So I just beat level 1 and it was harder immediately than I think it should have been. 
	- Something interesting about this game is how picky it was about what is a wall and can therefore be wall jumped and what cant.  I am a pretty good gamer but I wasnt when I was a kid and I remember getting this game and getting not too far, well one reason might be that the first sign that you have to wall jump off of well it really doesnt attach accurately.  It does if you knwo what to do and that it can be jumped off which everyone knows by now, and if you know how to wall jump and all of the possible button combinations that might make it work, but as a kid with no one to bounce ideas off of I suspect I didn't have much command of that wall jump at all especially on this imprecise first sign. 
	- The cutscenes are amazing in this game and really draw you in.   I remember feeling like this game was more like a movie than any other game I had seen, especially the first level which was in new york, but also since I couldnt make any real progress, like a movie that I wasn't going to be able to watch.  I felt like there should be a way for me to watch this game movie but I wasnt angry because the game wasn't made that way I blamed myself for being so broken that I couldn't even operate a simple movie game experience.  I wasnt cognizant of any of these thoughts but they were there in my head and heart nonetheless.
* Code Of Princess 3DS 8/7/2020
	- Well the setting and backstory do a good job drawing you in if you give them the patience because theres quite a bit.  Then the combat is pretty awesome!  Kind of like double dragon or even more like heavenly sword or soemthing but on a 2d battle plane but the graphics are 3d.  I haven't actually tried it stereoscopic yet but it runs great on hte latest nightly build.  Its really fun and even pretty sexy and I really like it.
* Hellbound 8/18/2020
	- This game was made for me.  I'm playing on normal mode (difficulty 2/4) and I feel like the demo was perhaps on harder mode than this, regardless I love it somuch.  I love exploring these places and figuring out how to solve these puzzles.  I am not sure whether you can save mid-level but I will find out soon but regardless Ihaven't been doing that I've been using the built in checkpoints.  I've been taking 10+ min to beat each level when it says par is 1-2min and I'm fine with that I have enjoyed it more this way.  I have no idea whether it includes deaths in your time because several times I've died and started over at the beginning of the level (update: getting through levels 1 and 2 my way took about 45 minutes).  I love how beautiful it is, I love the shooting and the enemies.  I love that the difficulty is perfect for me.  I am on the 3rd level now and whats really cool is its a super spooky graveyard that I'm in.  One other cool thing is I didn't even find the secrets on levels 1 or 2 (I know 0% on level 1) so theres much more to do and it would be fun to get better at each level to the point where I could blast through real quick and beat par deathless on each level. I love the music and the aesthetic and the gameplay and the controls.  This is like just perfect in so many ways for me.   like that once you ahve unlocked a level you can play just that level.  its also got a leaderboard for each level and each difficulty!  Now I noticed that on the old skool difficulty you really can't get in a melee swing on a shotguy guy without taking a hit, theres probably a way to time it and strafe at the right time, but in close quarters (like if they surprise you) you dont stand a chance of not getting hit.  I keep wanting to go faster, but I have more fun if I don't.  This game is what I wanted Doom Eternal to be (not that theres anything wrong per se with eternal).
	- I like how just before there was a serious sam style shootout, they said "its about to get serious" and then the huge arena shootout happened.  Which also is bad ass and a testament to sam that serious sam made such a name for himself and croteam by making their own style of shooter that was just different and interesting enough that it gets homages in a  game like this.  That is in the fury road survival section and mode.  I have unlocked basically 0% of secrets this whole game.  I really liked that city level. I feel like they could make that one into a survival level ... maybe they did!  I also like how in level 6 I think he walks into a room and says "And they call this a Mine.  A MINE" classic quote from FOTR!
	- Survival is really fun ... 
	- Today I played this for 5 hrs.  Thats a great triumph.  I wanted to save the last level for tomorrow, and then I can try my hand at a harder difficulty.  I love this game so much.  This is one of my top most satisfying purchases for my money.
	- Beat it this morning 8/19/2020 got 6 hrs in so far but its really fun so I'm going to play it again.  Sometimes incertain circumstances with special games I feel drawn to play them again immediately.  Other times I dont.  But for a really long game its rare that I want to play it again.  I love to experience things from different perspectives and even if its just a second time I always notice things I didnt before.  The final boss took me probably 25 min to figure out and beat maybe 30.  
	- I am glad that they added the save anywhere feature that wasnt in the demo, although I had a good time not using that feature.  Never did I play a section too many times at least on normal mode (difficulty 2/4).  Now I'm playing on difficulty 3/4 and its the same way - I'm not using the save feature and I'm not having to replay too much.  Some games in my past have made me replay 30-45 minutes of a slog of a level just to die on the boss and have to start over, and for me that sucks the fun right out of it (especially when thats par for the course for that given game), well this game the levels as slow and deliberately as I'm playing them are 10min max, and with a checkpoint even less so at most I'm trying a 5 minute part 3-4 times before I get it.  I suspect if I had used that feature the game would have been far less memorable, shorter, and less fun tbh.  Still its an important feature so players can practice parts whenever they need to and so things they cant figure out dont permanently hinder progress or set them back further than the fun threshold. 
	- Update 8/21/2020 Beat it on Old School, yesterday I beat it on Normal, I haven't beat it on noob or on Hellmare.  I dont know if I will try hellmare, maybe I'll try noob and see if I want to try hellmare.   Each time i beat it I didnt use any saves, I used checkpoints but didnt save and load myself at all. (proud of that).  Update: a few hours later early morning 8/22/2020 Beat it on Hellmare!  It didnt take that much longer than on the other modes, it didnt even take that muchlonger than on noob.  I'm proud of this!  
	- I've got 15hrs in this game according to steam.  This was a great purchase and one of my favorite games.  I wouldnt want more but look forward to some extra levels or dlc in the future.
	- Nightmare mode is stupid imho.  I spent about 20 min with it and have no interest in playing it since for me it completely changes how I can and like to play this game.  It takes life off constnatly which I actually am fine with them having this level in the game because it will make the game interesting for some players.  I think it making the taking hit sound and slightly blinking red is super annoying though.  it should just drain health or soemthing.

	- Balance Suggestions or bugs: 
		- Bug: I've gottens tuck in elevators 4 times.  I cant move or do anything.  Its usually when I jump or walk onto the elevator when it decides to start movign or wasnt stopped yet.
		- Time only seems to measure from your last checkpoint to the end, so I got like 2:17 with a par of 3:08 even though I died a few times.
		- Give an achievement for beating the game without loading
		- Balance Suggestion: Update: use shotgun alt fire and they die quick and most of this complaint is moot.  Original: Now I'm not liking the 3rd level as much specifically because of the demons who jump from 20ft at you and take 1/3 of your life and take 8 hits to kill.  You cant hit them with the shotgun because they jump too fast.  You can't swat at them with melee because they jump too fast, you can't shoot them from far off because they take too much ammo for you to beat the level you cant strafe to the side because the corridor is tiny.  And they jump around corners facing to the right they slide around the corner and take 1/3 of your life.  theres probably a good strat but it changes the gameplay so much I dont like it atm.  I like the gameplay of sneaking around and triggering events and then figuring out how to take out all of those enemies without losing too much life.  If you're at a safe distance then its 4 shotgun rounds.  if you're unsafe but lucky or take a hit then its only 2.  I've partially figured out the strat.  Lure them around the corner and blast and back up as fast as you can.  Its clumsy but it seems to work.  Also sneak around and get a shot off first if you know where they will be and can sneak back around the corner.  Update: I came to like it just fine after a few minutes.  Knowing when they are coming because you've died and theyre not too bad although they would be more fun if they jumped a little less and took off 10-15% of health instead of 30-40, at least on the normal level of difficulty.  I dont think anyone should be able to fly around corners when they are jumpers.  its not realistic, or expected.  it doesnt make sense, and it feels cheap.  There should be a little less of a chance for them to graze you and still take off 30-40%.  They should have more of a slight pause after their attack for you to escape and they should have 15-25% less life.  Trickier to implement would be to make their attack when they hit you clearer and give you an instant of time after they get to you before they slash.  As is its like they tap you and you lose 30%.  These are less fun because on normal mode you plan for a normal amount of care as you are going through the level and with these you can't have a normal amount of care.  Instead you have to know they are there or plan for them to be around every corner or turn and as a result they completely disrupt the pace of the game.  Sure you can learn their positions and beat them, but they're the only enemy where you HAVE to do that, but now you HAVE to do that for every step for the rest of the game or expect to die.  Previous to these enemies you can be more cavalier and run more and have more fun and be more playful and then back off if you get in over your head, and its your fault if you mess up by getting in too deep but it could really only happen a few times per level, and if it happens you will have time to recover and heal.  Now all of a sudden, because these enemies are overpowered, every step could mean you got in too deep.  On level 4 I was having lots of fun, and as a result happened to take a corner too fast and two of those guys were there and because they are overpowered I lost more than half my life in an instant.    Now the machine gun on later level 4 changes this and makes them easier to kill so a. I wonder if I shouldnt have been using the shotgun on them, and b. now that I have it, these guys aren't such a big deal anymore.  update: Except then in level 5 several times it spawns them IMMEDIATELY in front of you like you can't not touch them if you are moving foward when you hit the trigger.  for most enemies thats ok but for these guys its cheap.  Update: the second function of the shotgun is pretty bad ass and takes them out in one hit.  thats probably the right strat with these guys, shoot right as they jump at you with the alt fire (right click).  Update: One of these guys shows up on level 5 in the cave after you get the green key as you walk through a door it shows up behind you.  thats cheap imho.  You have to know its there by taking huge damage, figuring out where it is coming from and turning around before it hits you a 2nd or 3rd time to kill while its right up against you.  Thats a bit of a troll.
		- Is this a racing game?  On level 4 theres a race where you have to hit a lever, know exactly where to go and run full speed and probably theres less than 1s of grace period for you to mess up.  I think it would be more fun if there was a second or two more at least in normal mode.  I ran hard and well and failed it 3 times and made it the fourth by the skin of my teeth.  Level 5 the switch on the left opens a platform on the right.  Same story.  it needs a few more seconds on normal mode.  Probably even just 1 more second would make it feel more fair on this mode.  make it as tight and challenging as you want on harder modes.  I haven't played easy mode but I suspect these problems are there too.  Maybe I'll go find out?  Update: even on easy mode the race in level 3 where you run around a corner and through a door and right before you get to the gate that has lowered theres a red demon.  even on Noob mode you can barely make it through that gate.  A noon would not be able to make that.
		- Platforming: I really like the platforming in this game.  Its fair, and has good collisions and good platform design (up against walls if its skinny platform, relatively clear where to go and they're just far apart enough that its tricky but not so far its frustrating) and the jumping and platform catching is just the right amount of forgiving.  I would be ok with more (not any more precise platforming but platforming with tolerance and forgiveness is super fun) 
		- Balance Suggestion:   on level 4 the platform just after you get the green key is unforgiving and too small, its actually not but there are big blocks sticking up on the left.  Those blocks to the left shouldn't be that big and push you off the platform so easily.   The precision for that particular platform is unwieldy with these controls.
		- Balance: Theres a part of Noob mode that is harder than normal mode: the trap when you get the red key in the second to last level where you're sort of in a cage that exits out to some lava: There seem to be a lot more enemies that come out at that point on noob mode than normal mode.  Update No its different after you continue.  if you continue from that checkpoint you get way fewer enemies than if you come up on the checkpoint the first time.  thats noob or normal mode.
		- Probable Bug in the credits text?  The credits seem to cut out in the middle of a list of names?  maybe backers or patrons?  It stops at the letter N ... maybe I'm reading it wrong but if I'm not that can't be random. Kickstarter backers pending name approval - Sure enough the credits end with a list of "Kickstarter backers pending name approval" and then it lists a bunch of names alphabetically A,B,C...N and then stops. Theres no names after N and considering the statistical unlikeliness of there randomly being no kickstarter backers with names after the letter N I suspect a bug.   I'm sure theres another possible explanation for this too but wanted to bring it up.
		- Probable but in rankings: Suggestion: I would like to see players top 10 (if not more) as well as world top 10.  I would like to see players numeric rank in world rankings (even if estimated).  A common flaw in modern games though is it doesnt save any record of how you did previously.  I mean it does if you get on the leaderboard, in this case only the top 10 are visible but that is pretty absurd.  Top 10 in the world or ... you will never know what your score was in the past, whetehr you beat your previous best, how close you were to your previous best, whether you were above your previous median, or even what your personal top 10 are so you can try to get somewhere in there.  
		- Video Settings Bug: Changing resolution doesnt apply until you quit.  If it said that when you hit apply or in the notes on that screen it would go a long way to making it ok that it doesnt do it immediately.
		- Cool improvement: When weapon is fists when hes running he makes a cool motion, when he jumps he shouldnt tuck in his fists he should spread them out just a bit kind of like wings.  That would feel more natural to see someone do that when they jump.  or maybe since the FOV isnt big enough to see arms spread, just flatten both hands and put one off to the side and the other out in front like they're doing a slight superman move.

	- I simultaneously thought I would like this game a lot and wanted to not like it.  I spent 30 min with it and didnt end up liking it.  Its not a fun game for me to PLAY in.  I just died too easily and I didnt feel flow to the levels.  I couldn't just goof around for even a few seconds or I would die.  I didnt get very far because I don't have the attention or care to plan each step very carefully.  I'm sure if I spent more time with it I would improve and get further and it would become easier to get further, but this just isn't the kind of game I like to play.
* TOME4 8/23/2020
	- Wow I love this (for now) i recognize that this is likely to be too hard, but I donated so I should get infinite lives mode, and I presume thats really what I'm looking for, persistent levels and infinite lives?  Its forgiving at the beginning and you can play for quite a while before getting even close to dead.  
	- I watched some guys youtube about it first SplatterCatGaming which helped with my confidence(since I've been burned by roguelikes before -spent a long time and found them to be interesting but just a depth and difficulty I dont care for).  Actually what I think it helped with was giving me a starting point that I understood.  I didnt have to interpret for myself all of the overwhelming options and descriptions, I could start with some idea of what these actions do and how to activate them and what matters and what doesnt.  In particular they explained quickly and showed in action the actions that the character can do from the beginning and that has helped me a ton with figuring it out from near zero.  Some games have conventions but i'm not familiar enough with rl or rpg conventions to have understood enough of this to be comfortable and watching the video helped with giving me an anchor point for understanding what is going on.  I think I would like this more if I had more storage or encumberance, but I'm sure that will come with time.  OMG Like 30 min after I wrote that I got it!!!  Hooray!  that actually really encourages me to keep playing actually.  getting valuable improvements that legitimately make the game better is really motivating.
	- I am really enjoying looking around pretty casually and finding cool loot and equipping it.  Its super fun!  I just found a cool mace of massacre and it made me happy!  I feel like I would love a whole game like this which didnt get even that much more intense than this, but certain battles could be intense and that is fine.  Keeping the intensity high the whole game is certainly not what I am looking for.  I just realized something.  I donated but that wasnt applied to my account yet so this game I will die after like 7 lives at most (probably after 1 or 2) and that will be sad, but I will have made lots of progress.  
	- I noticed that I also like that it gives you just a few abilities at first and lets you get used to them through combat and then introduces more.  Some games take too long to introduce new abilities, some introduce them too often.  This one feels just right.
	- Hunger - annoying
	- (Update: turns out this [Zone Order](https://te4.org/wiki/Recommended_Zone_Order_Progression ) website seems to be expected that you know about it.  If you don't but you do know some simple rules of how the game works and labels things and where you are expected to go and where you aren't then you can figure this stuff out but for the first few runs ... anyway its not as bad as I thought at first when I wrote the following) Original Huge balance problem for me: This has stolen a bunch of the fun for me of playing this.  I know that I only have a certain number of lives (then again I have unlimited lives in explorer mode since Iam a donator so maybe its ok) but with just a few lives or just one, I was in the old forest which is listed in the quest log as the first place to go, and all of the enemies were totally manageable, but then i entered this one room and BOOM 2 turns and I'm dead (even after I teleported).  Then i get resurrected and buff myself and go to try to take that guy out again and 3-4 turns and I'm dead.  I barely even touched the guy.  As a matter of fact it might have been that there was an invisible guy killing me but in this game theres no room for error or mistakes and theres no room for being unprepared, so imho this shouldn't have been presented to the player until later.  Everyone else was like 70 life, then all of a sudden I'm up against 2 guys who have 800 life, one is hidden, and their attacks take 1/3-1/2 of my health.  And you dont get a re-do.  It was fun and somewhat casual until that moment and hit me from out of nowhere and I dont enjoy that kind of surprise pacing and intensity.  Update: Well I didn't realize that it had a minimum level of 7 I actually could have sworn it said no min level and it said range 1 which I thought was level.  I think as a result this is something that could totally be avoided.  I could build up my player if I had unlimited lives and come back, or something.  I wonder if I get to keep my gear? Yes I do.  Woudl have felt clever if I had grabbed some of the loot that was there with my dying moves haha.  It was first in the list which might be a bit misleading, but I think with what I have learned I wouldn't have even gone in there.  It still is weird that the leap was so enormous.  no one was hitting me for anything and then wham, bam, dead.  Update: When I went to the appropriately levelled dungeon the enemy was just hard enough to make me think and work to win, it was perfectly levelled, and required that I use strategy and tactics but as long as I used some decent level of that I was sure to win eventually.  It took me a while.  But there was no hit, hit, dead,  nor was it easy by any stretch.  Perfect. Update: I found out now that at the wiki page "Recommended Zone Order Progression" it suggests an order for your race/class, but one tricky part is in the trollmire zone it offers for you to go to a bloody area floor 4 and I figured why not.  I survived, but it turns out I was a bit lucky.  Thats recommended doing after you've done all of the 7 tier one zones.  I had done only 1 at that time.  I think its ok, and it doesn't just let you go in there unwarned, but you kind of have to know that this is the kind of game that isn't leading you through to come out alive.  I like when you are in an easy dungeon for your level it lets you skip ahead to the end of the dungeon and fight the boss.  Thats classy.  Note: when you do that you can still absolutely get overwhelmed and die! I didnt get close to death per se, but I got far more beat up than I expected in far shorter of a time than I planned, because I rushed in too quickly after it sent me down to the boss level. Update: As a matter of fact they give you a quest right away to go visit the old forest.  That makes the new player think that is something they should do now since they are given a quest to do it.  If they were give a quest to go to the level 1 dungeons that would make a TON of sense and wouldnt mislead.  It also says to go places in the quest but in the recommended zone order it repeatedly says "go two levels down dont go to the guartdian or the third level" and stuff like that.  This means that its sort of intended that you figure out which bosses you can take on and which you cant by dying and starting the game over from scratch and playing through the same dungeons (differnet layouts and technicalilties) again.
	- Wait is there no way to grind in this game?  when I went back to the first trollmire I didnt find any enemies except 1 that I had apparently missed.  Do they never respawn?  Does it just take longer?  I dont know about this, but I have found (via the wiki recommended zone order progression) that there are many more level 1 dungeons, and I had tried a mid tier 2 dungeon earlier thats why I died.  Now I will know and after today it will feel like my fault if I do that again.
	- I like that you can compare what you're looking at against what is already equipped.  I like that it tells you its going to ditch things before you leave.  
	- Update in the Derth city storm I died once but it was after a bunch of tactical success and then I got cocky and careless and ran in and got surrounded thinking I could handle the lower enemies, but they surprised me with their power and I couldn't escape.  Totally my fault.  It was very hard for my level though I will say that.  I dont even see it on the recommended zone order progression.  also the dark cave in the Daikara should be listed as "dont enter".  I learned my lesson the hard way to not let the bad boys step on the stairs.
	- Cool Places: Sandworm Lair was a really interesting level. I'm impressed they pulled that off. The heart of gloom is beautiful!
	- Update: Pathetic difficulty problem.  I'm up to level 17 and I still just nearly died and then died full on from that worm that walks asshole in the old forest, I did almost no damage to him.  According to the guide I'm supposed to go to the old forest but dont descend to the lake, well I'm only in the first area of the old forest and this is the guy who two shotted me before, and its no different now.  maybe 3 shots but he can hit me for 1/4 of my damage from the furthest sight distance, I otoh can only barely hit him unless I'm close and zooming in and bashing him doesnt kill him in time.   He is far far harder than any of the other enemies I've come up against and I don't stand a chance without a new strat.  Hopefully this reflect rune will work perfectly and he can kill himself.  If it doesnt' work I'm not sure whether I could beat him even with unlimited lives!?! I'm down to only a few lives left.   He is elite level 25.  Nope he killed me for the last time.  I rushed into him, shield bashed him both ways and then kept hitting him and then tried to escape by teleporting but he teleported between me and the exit right after I teleported.  I got him down to right around 50% and thought it was promising, but he was healing so much I never got him lower and he just kept smashing me worse and worse.
* Avadon 8-26-2020 
	Boy this game is cool. Theres so much polish, almost as much as TOME, maybe just as much it just works a bit different thats all.  I bought this in a humble bundle a really long time ago.  maybe as long as ... 8-10yrs ago?  I had played some spiderweb and had high admiration for their software, primarily I spent time with Blades of Avernum which was somewhat of an RPG creator system, and either played part of the campaign of that game or one of the other games, but this was back like 2007 on my mac laptop since they were one of the few software houses making mac games (also escape velocity nova (and everything from ambrosia software), and the pinball games by littlewing).  I'm playing in casual mode.  
	- I like so much about this game: 
		- "Jerkin: Like pants for your chest" lol.  
		- I love how fleshed out avadon castle is.  They really went above and beyond and I remember this from their other games.  In the dungeons they even put in empty cells and some locked.  They didn't have to make barred doors for us to know that this was a row of cells.  They put in a huge torture chamber and described in words any details that weren't clear in the graphics.  it covers a lot of area with enough tilesets to make it interesting and the rooms distinct.  And there is stuff everywhere and its ok that a lot of it is decoration its just cool that its there and there are people everywhere and its ok that a lot of them have the same things to not say to you because they are intimidated, its cool that they are there and it makes it all alive and feel lived in.  Its not all just visual but you can pick up cups and ropes and broken swords all over and they dont help or hurt you they are just decoration and they go a long way to making it feel real.  
		- I like how you can pick party members when you go on quests (to some degree anyway) I am meeting people throughout the castle who can adventure with me when I go.
		- The quartermaster explains why they dont just give me all of my supplies and among other explanations "Would you rather hand everything you find back to me and then settle for what I give back?  I thought not" Thats a great and convincing rationale actually and its cool they explored that since thats what you would think in that situation.
		- I like that when the people are told that the cave is clear you actually see them all walk out of the room.  I think thats a nice touch.  
		- Its cool that when theres a window into a room or bars you can see through it from that angle, but when theres not you can't see anything in that room.
		- Most of these maps are a work of art and larger and more carefully placed than some entire games.  
		- "What did you say about his wizard?" "Only that he is a craven servile toady with far more power than wisdom or sense.  Other than that nothing" lol
		- on just ONe stalagmite in the bat cave there is a turtle balanced on top lol
	- Quality of life: 
		- Junk Bag A really nice quality of life feature is the junk bag.  Cmd-click it and then you can sell all that off with one click
		- Accessing party inventories I can access their inventories from anywhere in the castle (so I dont have to go walk to them to swap weapons or something)
		- And when selling and transferring equipment its great to just press 123 to switch between characters and send equipment from one to the other.  This whole inventory management is great.
		- And when you interrupt the leader he seems to be rambling but ends up telling you some background.  he even answers why he is telling you that information.
	- Questions: Will I be able to grind for gear in this game or is there a set amount of gear?  By grinding I dont mean that killing 1000 enemies might yield one piece of random armor, but that you could really deck out your party by grinding for a few hours.  I kind of hope that is the case.  Or at least that you could deck out your party by grinding to earn dosh and buy the gear you wanted.  Current Guess: No there isn't grinding here.  You just get to explore whats available and kill what is there.
	- Possible Improvements:
		- Funny, it said to pick up a cloak from the table, but it hadn't told me how to do that.  I expected when I went near the table it would give me an icon or indication that I could pick it up or if I clicked on it I was sure it would bring up the inventory or just put it in my inventory but none of that happened.  I had to google but since other people had the same problem (even as far back as 2011) they said I just have to look at my inventory when i'm near the cloak and it will let me take it (sort of off the ground).  Its a little weird because you click on containers like cabinets to open them and then it brings you to your inventory, but you dont click on items to bring them into your inventory.  I'm ok with it but it is a hair counterintuitive.
		- Quality of life: simple and effective: Whenever you are in a menu, clicking outside of the menu window should be the same as ok ... maybe not though because you might think cancel ... How about this: if there is an ok and a cancel then you have to click one or hit enter.  if there is just a checkmark or an ok then clicking outside the window clicks that ok and closes the window
		- Quality of life: when buying things from the multipage list page up and down and the arrows should scroll.  Ideally the scroll wheel should scroll too.
		- In quest log there should be a way to ask it where to go to return the quest.  As is I am going to start writing them down.
		- When you are next to an opponent and you click on it to attack, if you ahve bow and arrow equipped you cant.  You have to switch weapons and then it will let you attack.  Until then you are interrupted.  I feel like it could just switch for you in that case. 
		
* The Ground Gives Way 8-26-2020
	This is a good simple short roguelike, but I dont like it because it doesn't have what I'm looking for.  In particular I dont want hunger, or the complexity of identification, nor do I want to be scared to make every move.  Still kudos to the authors.
* Project Osiris (10/17/2020) Awesome.  Makes a weird noise on sewer level.  (11/20/2020)  The sewer level has great difficulty.  i dont remember what difficulty I picked but its taken me a number of tries to get through but I'm making progress every time.  On level 4 The Courtyard in the first room there are curved stairs to the left and behind them is a little room.  If you run in there the breed can't get to you directly for some reason. They bounce on the stairs like a pinball until they happen to get through the little section.  General: health pickups flash the screen a bit too much and without being conscious of it they distract and make me wonder if I'm getting hit.  The shotgun is underpowered imho.  I can't seem to use it with success at all (even in close quarters) maybe its just me but in doom I can use the shotgun and here I cant. 
	- 12/19/2020 I JUST BEAT the courtyard level (maybe number 4) and it was a lot of fun.  there were lots of keys to pick up and find and then get into other parts fo the level.  Lots of bad boys.  I loved it.  I used my trackball and i'm getting decent with it.
	- its so classy that the cursor is the amiga cursor.  also its awesome that. 
	- 12/20/2020 On level 6 ist awesome how you get the green key and if you keep exploring you find a teleporter that not onlly takesy ou back to near where you started but puts you in a position where you are staring right at the green key door
	- I'm thinking that the red guys when they touch you they attack a bit too fast imho.  If you run out of ammo and theyre by you they dont just hit you once but over and over and kill quickly.  I wonder if this is how it worked in the original ab3d.   I also wonder about how slowly the weapons change.  I wish they changed faster but maybe its a part of the original to change this slow.
	- On level 7 The Furnace I really like this level.  I'm on attempt #5 or so but every time I get further which to me is the sign of a great game. 
	- On Level 9 the surface zone I had to try it probably 15 times I got really good at it though.  each battle was a process of learning how to do it in a way taht allowed you to succeed.
	- Level Training Area I found a secret in some water in a corner down low about half way through.  Barely saw it.  I beat it but it probably took like 15 tries and it was fun.
	- I've been playing all the way through the levels but I'm oing to look and see how many there are.  IF its just 1-3 more then I'll keep going if not I'll start saving when I get a key.  ok there are 16 and I'm on 11 ... 
	- Level 12 is a cool spiral where the enemies can come out from anywhere.  its called the pit and was good but there wasn't enough ammo for me.  I ended up barely making out certainly not with enough to kill all of the enemies at teh end (not just gun ammo but more powerful)
	- Level 13 Strata didnt take too many tries and was fun and interesting. on this level I didnt have to actually beat all of the enemies and probably should have skipped more.  Might go play it again to save ammo.  yeah i played it like 3 more times and beat it the last time with full life and loads of fancy ammo took 6min	
* GZDoom
	- Interesting mouse centering, if the game is playing (project osiris for example) and you click the menu bar to drag the game it turns on drag mode (on mac at least) and then instantly recneters the mosue in teh window which menas the mouse gets dragged to where the center of the window was when youc lciked which means teh window get smoved there too.  hit escape to enter the menu to avoid this
* Bleed 11/25/2020 I got this from the racial bundle and its really fun!  2D shooter wiht wasd and then shoot with the mouse and theres slow time and triple jump and cool levels and weapon upgrades and bosses its great!
* Alien Syndrome 12/2/2020 I got this working in retroarch and its fun and I have good memories of it.  THe parallax on level 2 especially is awesome.  I remember it mostly from c64 actually because it was a game I could make real progress on.  in this arcade version you can continue but ONLY if the secondplayer is alive still and even then theres a hardcore time limit so its really tough.  Still I really like the basic idea here: captured shipmates you are trying to rescue on many different ships and planets and you get weapon upgrades and maps from the wall.  The enemies ai is not too interesting on level 1 and 2 at least they just move back and forth if they are the basic ones and the others chase you from off screen. Then you get a boss after each level.  I got past level 1.
* Retroarch 12/2/2020 Its so damn clumsy but also so great.  1. fullscreen mode doesnt allow for multitasking at all :(.  mouse barely works and the ways it does are completely unusable paradigms.  scroll thruogh menus like its a big scrollbar?  no mouse wheel?  clicking doesnt work?  you have to nkow where all of the important menus are: input, folders, you have to load cores first is the biggest paradigm difference with almost every other app.  many more stupid quirks.  Works best with arrows enter backspace or gamepads. . once you figure it all out its really amazing.  looking forward to netplay.  had to set the starting directory to the roms folder in settings directories.   Had to download the 2003 mame core.  Had to get roms specificially from the 0.78 mame romset whatever that means.  thats how I got wrestlefest working with Tom.  If you want to use your only joystick to play as player two in your game, all of the menus stop working from that joystick.  Theres no obvius way to set port 2 to use the keyboard.
	- I wanted to setup my inputs so I could have a ps4 controller and a keyboard that I coudl switch back and forth.  I set them both to the same input settings and al of a sudden the cursor moves twice in teh menu instead of just once.  So I tried reassigning just one of the arrow keys in port 2 and now no cursor or joystick movement works.  I restarted.
	- So now I've setup the dual shock on input 1 and saved.  I also have keyboard setup on input 1. I also have the dual shock on input 2.  This way I can control both player 1 and two at same time.   Now if I the device index on input 1 it shoudl be keyboard input 1 and playstation 4 input 2.  Yes that worked.
	- Trying to get light gun games to work with the mouse with limited success.  For Hogans alley for example setting it to mouse does technically work but the movement of the mouse is totally off.  Maybe it needs to be fullscreen?  well in OpenEMU it works perfectly with no configuration
	- Tons of recurring problems with inputs that just dont happen with openemu.  For whatever reason mac killed the bluetooth id of my ps4 controller so now its got two and neither are the same as before.  the game remap files that I had no longer work because they point to the old ps4 controller.  its really broken. 
	- While playing wonderboy in the samurai castle I was doing fine not great but fine.  I switched to make some notes and when I switched back my attack button didnt work anymore :( i got quickly juggled and killed in the 3 seconds it took me to figure out what was going on.  Keyboard stopped working to control the menus too.  had to abandon my run.  That soured me prettty bad,  update: right after I wrote that I switched back adn everything worked again.  doesnt inspire confidence or Trust..  switched back again and it doestnt work.  update: now its worse.  now I cante ven press f1 to activate the menu and it deactivated on its own.  also I checked and there are no external devices around here being pressed.  also maybe it has to do with teh app its switching TO and from.  That may be it.  I had a quickview window up in finder.  closed it and it started working again.   It might have to do with switching to this app. If I get back into the game and it auto switches out of the f1 menu or even out of the pause menu.  if it happens I can switch to finder adn then to retroarch and back 3 times and it seems to be fixed. how to know if its fixed?  if the cursor keys work in the f1 menu (also if the f1 menu doesnt work same problem). 
	- Dual Shock problem.  Playing on hardcore. While I'm playing i hit pause and get a snack.. coming back my ds4 is off.  Turn it on.  retroarch says its back but it no longer controls the game.  Do i have to set all controls to keyboard only an duse an external mapper?  Will that weven work?
* OmegaRace 12/2/2020 I got the last high score but I think I could get even more with a bit of practice.  I did it I got hte top all time score!  it does save high scores which i think is bad ass
* Guildmaster: Gratuitous Subtitle
	- Review: Wow this is a great fun fantasy strategy game with a distinct and super entertaining sense of humor.  I just beat it and had fun from start to finish.  If it had been strictly a strategy game it would still be great but the developer hired a brilliant youtube comedian to write the dialogue and it shines and makes every intermission between levels (where most of the dialogue is located) a pleasure.  The progression is cool being based on a few statistics and the equipping of gear in your party and one of the coolest quality of life features is the awesome 'auto-equip' function which completely smooths over the process while still allowing for customization and allows the main focus to remain on the combat and the entertaining dialogue. The quirky hilarious dialogue is primarily presented in the form of conversations between the guildmaster and their guild between quests.  After every quest you will see that some of your guild members have something to say and when you talk to them about the previous mission they have a hilarious conversation of some sort every time.  The creativity of the humor and story doesn't wane as the game progresses the dialogue maintains solid high quality entertainment all the way through (even through the ending).   I love how as I progress the guild is starting to fill out with people.  I love seeing more and more people in my home base.  Reminds me of suikoden which I loved.   The developer is a cool and approachable person and he is active on twitch (where he streams twice a week), youtube (where he has been making videos for about 10yrs), and twitter as @jimplaysgames and on his own website at jimmakesgames.com.  
	 One last nice touch that shows the attention to detail in this game: I love how even though the game is grid based, when one player is in a tight corridor and you want another player to get past them they kind of scoot around them like would happen in real life.  The developer didn't have to do this and could have just made them overlap but that would have been clumsy but they went the extra mile to polish up little things like this.  
	- I had this vision which is admittedly a little bit silly of when an arrow misses and shoots off into the blackness what if a noise was played ... specifically the alarmed noise of a cat reaawr!  or a glass breaking lol
	- Funny:
		- There were so many funny things 
		- "A bit of the old Urgent PooPoo. I think it was the lamb.",  StarTrek teleporter description haha,  "consider me a caterer for the great carrion banquet"
		- I liked fighting the Goblin Peen.  Oh Goblin Pawn?  I actually read goblin peen first time I saw it lol
	- Liked:
		- 
	- AutoEquip is such a huge freaking deal for me.  It doesnt seem like it would be a deal breaker but it would have made it so much more cumbersome to get into the quests and for me would have added a bunch of brain work that I am not in the mood for and dont really want to care about at this point.  Its perfect to have a computer taking care of it for us. 
	- I like how you have to switch characters because the ones you just used are resting
	- I like how the clever dialogue gets even better as time goes on
	- Tips:
		- After beating the first level earlier I had a lot of fun beating the second.  I used some tips i had picked up from the launch stream and from watchin gothers play it: 1. go talk to everyone 'ask about previous quest' to get their clever jokes between missions 2. Dont aggro anyone, stay back and dont reveal the fog of war, 3. use that jumping attack.  
		- Rabbit: "I beelined for the damaging Guildmaster spells just to get that targeted stun spell."    "The power of stun should not be underestimated"
		- What seems to be working for me is taking a few steps at a time (so I dont aggro too many enemies at once).   This means when they come into view dont go forth and attack them let them come to you.  the disadvantage is you lose an attack round with the enemies that you see.  The advantage is you dont have three more crossbowmen attacking you on the next turn
		- learn about elemental magic (it seems to be like rock paper scissors).  I dont know how to tell which enemies are resistant to which attacks.
		- Mistakes I made: 1. Accidentally retreating away from an enemy so far they went out of sight so I couldnt attack htem that turn.  attacking energy elemental with fire.   
		- If you die then try a few more times 'from last checkpoint' rather than going back to the guild or restarting the quest.
		- Dont be too concerned with losing a character or two.
		-  

	- Spoiler By Level
		- 9 with the red mage this was rough since there were so many people in one place all aggroed at once.  I think I beat it on my 4th try.
		- 10 with bandits and a bandit leader: Well I made it on my 2nd or 3rd wipe with two people left.  Had to defeat the golems first - learned that the hard way by focusing on the boss
		- 11 with two crystals and the red mage I got it on my second try.  That time at the cost of the loss of my guildmembers I just attacked the crystal and then the red mage.  it went pretty smooth actually only lost one person.  
		- 12 Wow the lighting is amazing in this level especially
		- 14 Wow its so scary to see this huge battle.  "In the tutorial dont you remember?" LOL  "They skipped the tutorial!"  Its so funny that early decisions matter so much in the end game.
		- Beat it at 1 pm on Dec 11!  It says I was in the game 18 hours.  I dont know about that. I know at least 2 of those was just me sitting here but I think it counted some hours I wasnt playing.  
	- Feedback:
		- I dont think its obvious enough that much of the character of the game is in teh dialogue options called "ask about previous quest"  if I were in a rush I would skip that every time and miss an enormous amount of charm.
		- Would like an end turn key and a confirm key (you dont want to use these skills?) it would make the whole process be 100% combat and no menus combat action combat action combat action combat action. 
		- For a major content upgrade I saw someone mention near the end of the launch stream the idea of putting a substantial level of humor into the names and descriptions of the weapons.  
		- For a medium-large new feature add a rest option instead of just end turn where you rest until another enemy shows up inside the fog of war.  If there are no enemies inside the fog of war it lets energy reaccumulate until it is full, and heals too (assuming that the healers or guildmaster would do that work)
		- When the turn is almost over clicking on the portraits doesnt always switch the action icons at the bottom.  It doesnt because it instead says "no actions remaining" but it feels like a bug (everytime I click on a character those icons should change and their available move radius should be selected) otherwise clicking on the characters has an inconsistent and confusing response.  More importantly than feeling like a bug is during this turn I want to at least peruse what actions will be available for my party next turn and I cant see that anymore I can only see teh options of the ones that still have available actions.   Its not annoying to be able to select someone and then find out I've used all of their actions.  Further you click on someone and then if you dont wait to whether a second later it says no action left then it doesnt select them and moves someone else which could really ruin your strats.  Clicking should always respond.  
		- bigger thing If your character is moving you should be able to select another character.
		- it looks like if I dont spend my money quite right (like not equipping any bombs) I cant even go on elamrs quest
		- In the first three or 4 quests theres no loot but in the 4th or 5th all of a sudden Ive got to get loot out of a chest.  I had been trained not to click on chests and boxes and drawers and shelves but now I had to to finish teh level.. Not a big deal but maybe an indicator or make all of them end that way or something.
		- When I'm levelling up I dont remember which characters have magic or spells they have so I dont know which ones to invest willpower in.
		- during combat Right Clicking on character brings up their stats, clicking or right clicking outside of the stats window should close the stats window.
		- Consider adding hit percentages to melee because it was a constant problem swinging and missing at goblins due to evade but that could be calculated and warned
	
* Master Spy
	- This was on mac and a few years ago I got it workign on mac and then used some gamepad mapping utility to get it workign with my gamepad and had lots of fun. I never finished but always wanted to go back and finish it later but now the game isnt compatible with the latest macos anymore so all of my progress is lost.  Some people would blame me or apple for updating the os and leaving behind 32bit support.  others would blame the dev for not updating the game in the last few years.  either way it jsut doesnt work.  but I can stream it from PC and it works pretty well!
	- This is a fantastic game.  It's pure simple platforming where you have to figure out how to navigate the rooms and get the keys without getting caught.  Its easy to get caught but the gameplay loop hardly punishes you at all and in that sense it reminds me (in a great way) of VVVVVV where you try things over and over until you figure out how to do it and then execute it properly.  It never punishes you by taking you back too far.  Mechanically and in graphical sttyle this game could have been on the NES and would have been a great game back then too even with the limitations of that platform.  It certainly could have been on 16 bit computers and consoles and would have been a great game there too.  Its fun with a cool story and cinematics and hard but not punishing and I love it.
	- The checkpoints are fair (on novice at least they are even mid level)
	- steam streaming even at super low resolutions has pretty choppy audio and gameplay even when turning bandwidth up to max and stuff. I wonder if I moved my laptop around if that would make a difference or if I moved the router.
* Ivan Ironman Stewarts Off Road
	- I watched Magnum have a problem with this on stream but eventually got it working.  I cant select the finish when I'm inputting my name in retroarch so it doesnt work.
	- 10 seconds of the gameplay after I got it working in openemu and I was not having fun anymore.  
* Wonderboy 3 The Dragons Trap 12/8/2020
	- Started Tuesday - 
	- Under the Sphinx from left to right:  1 coins, 2 moneybags, 3 fireballs, 4 tornadoes, 5 arrows, 6 Boomerangs, 7 lightning bolts, 8 charms+1potion
	plus every time you go back up you get a moneybag from that dude, or sometimes a BOOMerang
	- The samurai castle you can despawn the blue samurai sometimes.  Othertimes they respawn and make life hell.
	- I beat this when I was a kid.  First game I ever beat.  So proud.  I remember trying things until I randomly figured out how to get into the final castle.  I  was nearly demoralized but so proud.  I thought it was a secret.  I thought for sure that a hidden entrance like that had to be a side bonus not part of the main quest.  
	- I never got the tasmanian sword when I was a kid.  if I had I wouldnt have known how to use it.  I remember getting most gear but there were a few that eluded me.  I dont remember the hades armor and I dont rememer an armor that had that effect.  I wonder if that effect or how to use the tasmanian sword is listed in the manual?  I do think I went back to the castle and was so excited to find out it was the same one I stared in it was a great throwback.  This game took me a long time so it felt like a long time had passed since I first ventured forth from that castle.  
	- The potion should always refill all life.  When it only refills 2 it really stinks and causes problems. 
	- A few days later Dec 14 after maybe 15 runs on the samurai dragon I beat him without getting hit.  It was an amazing accomplishment and I'm really proud.  I was previosuly stocking up on potions and stuff before makign teh run but I had gotten good enough that most of hte time I could get through teh cave and castle on one life and since there was a secret at teh end and since i had to make it without gettin ghit it didnt materr how much life I had by the end of the castle as long as I was alive.  I did it!  I onlyhad one boomerang too (the castle is easier with a stockpile of two) otoh I was finding strategies to get through teh castle without getting hit much and in 2 rooms without even fighting anyone  there were only a few rooms taht were still tricky
	- Its Dec 15 and I think I badged it!  I'm about to go check but the final one was ot figure out how to switch to human.  To do that I got the tasmanian sword, held down the v key and jumped and slashed at the top of teh jump and when I landed it switched and I cycled all the way through to human.  I entered the code that was in themanual to get to this position where I could do this.   (which I had assigned to be button 2. I actually had all 4 buttons for p1 assigned to aszx in the shape of the xbox controller buttons and all 4 buttons for p2 assigned to dfcv in the shape and then it automapped button 2 to v aka the A button on the right)
* Knight n Grail - (12/31/2020)
	- this game is so cool.  I first learned about this game a year ago from pacbillys video about it and wanted to play it then, but then a few weeks ago I saw someone elses video about it and didtn remember pacbillys video.  pbs was the first 2064 video so I had watched it several times.  I bought the game today for just $5 and got it working in vice with up to jump on my ds4.  
	- Update: Sound problems are a mac problem somehow.  Sound wasnt working at first but when I reloaded a snapshot it worked, but was scratchy and the second time worked great.   Update: switching away from the vice window and back I lose sound.  Update: going into the vice menu and back out a few times seems to reset it sometimes, but it still gets scratchy and then fades to nothing every few minutes.  If theres no sound changing the frequency seems to reset it.  save load quickstate is the most reliable way to fix it.  Update: Im almost done with the game and this has been a constant problem.  I just realized that the sound with the crackling and all is the same problem I had with Project Osiris getting otu of the water in the GZDoom engine.  This means it certainly wasn't a problem specific to gzdoom.  rumor had it that it was a thing to do with the hertz of the output in the computer.  
	- I like the floppy disc sounds but I had to set them to 8% volume
	- The combat is super satisfying.  Wow an automap and equip screen when you press space???
	- I noticed that it seems like you can program both joysticks to the same device and keys.  That could be fun for gauntlet!  
	- It seems to expect the joystick to be in port 2.  Every time i start vice I have to do all of the joystick stuff again.  Probably a result of my ps4 wireless.  When the ps4 controller shut off it seemed to crash vice actually.  
	- Everytime I start I have to load the disk, setup the controller, map all of the buttons, settings dont seem to save unfortunately, then I can load my save state..
	- I've been saving when I shoot an orb and quicksaving when I get to a new area.  
	- Got to Wyvern Caverns!
	- I figured something out that is obvious in hindsight.  When you're playing and you want to hit the space bar (I havent mapped it) but you can hit it with the bottom of your joystick or your knuckle. Its like a two hand motion instead of a button press.  I always imagined putting the joystick down or holding it with just one hand in order to do that.  
	- I beat the wyvern boss!  I thought it was cool that you had to have the earth armor or you couldn't really beat him.  OTOH I have the water armor and still got hit by the wyverns blue shots and that seems weird.   Got a double jump!  KnG3.sav  After that boss if you go the right way (and possibly before that boss) you get to a rune stone the rune of rebirth where you can save to the disk!
	- I like all of the little clues they give when you push down in front of the glowing stones.  They are like ... poems
	- just spent 30 minutes getting 'enjoyable' the controller mapping software for mac working to remap a ps4 controller button to my keyboard space bar!  It seemed to be working but then just never did shit.  looking in lots of forums where lots of people think its just totally broken, i found that you have to just delete it from accessibility and input monitoring in system prefs security tab and then re-add it and then un check and recheck it and then after like a minute or two of changed commands it started working.  now it works great to press space bar for the menu which is super convenient.  
	- To get input working way better i setup a joystick keyset in c64 emulator and then set left and right in enjoyable to left and right on the keyboard and then up and down in enjoyable to nothing on the keyboard and a few buttons to up and down for jump and activating the stones and floating  and fire in enjoyable to fire on the keyboard and then you know what else ... even after all that the c64 emulator ViCE was still opening the menu with the fire button overriding what i set in enjoyable so i had to remap that to fire in the joystick buttons ettings even though it should have been using the keyset and not the joystick mappings.  anyway now it works and feels like a super solid console game!  Update: VICE seems to automatically use the PS4 hat switches for menu commands so when I used enjoyable to map the hat switches to the arrow keys then it was taking joystick input PLUS cursor inputs.  Instead I made the game use the numeric keypad keys so enjoyable only maps to those now.  Now the only problem is that the x button ALWAYS brings up the menu.  if you save your joystick settings which is below the screen on the settings page, you can look at them and then change them.  whats cool about this is you can even set any joystick button to activate anything in the menu!  you just have to figure out the path to that menu item and there aren't any examples of that.  I believe I will be able to remove the offending lines, but when these are loaded they are loaded as 'patches' to the existing settings.  I want to clear them all ... hmm ... nope it didn't work to merely remove them.  Ok I couldnt really figure it out so i reset to defaults and then loaded my specific settings and joystick setttgsin.  i dont know where the default joystick settings are kept or i probably could have solved it.
	- Learned a lot about settings and joysticks and keyboards tonight.
	- I'm just trying to find out how to open the big door it says I need the golden sword.  So I'm just going to walk every corner of the castle and shoot every wall and I've found like 3 secrets so far.  I dont know how to get a trasure chest that is high up not too far to the left of the big spiky door..   I found a secret at the bottom to the right with a big spike pit and I dont know how to get over it.   When I got up to the top left I remembered this weird circle that said "bring all swords to me and Ill give you something for free" and if I had taken a note about that earlier I would have known right where to go.  That gave me the golden sword!  I found it!  As it turns out it was pretty close to the teleporter and if I had just gone that way and looked around I probably would have found it.   
	- Ok!  I got the bad ending!  Before I did I got a map which revealed the whole map and there is a chunk more that I never got to.  	
	- controls double jump worsk, but theres a slight occasioanl hitch, meaning probably ever 10-20 times it just doesnt double jump when Im counting on it.  Thats after remapping my controls so I cant push up or down.  
	- Progress: Now I have found three places where I need a higher jump but I got something called like eagle flight or something but apparently that has to do with seeing secrets.  
	- omG i baet it with the good ending its so cute and its aweseome that the music is different and catchy and up beat in this ending!   i actually ahd everything but didnt end it right once and had to do the whole ending part again!
* Super Mario Bros Cart (1/1/2021)
	- Wow this is so cool.  What I would have given for this game on C64 back in the day on a cartridge not just a disk.  wow ... it plays near perfect, some slowdown.  Totally tiny differences in controls and screen pixel size.  its really great
	- Surprised that holding up and pressing the fire button continues the game where you left off like holding a and pressing start on NES
	- The run jumping like off of little platforms isnt perfect compared to the NES game but thats a nit.  
	- It jsut feels like sometimes when i push the jump button it just doesnt.  Input polling slowdown perhaps?  Gauntlet was slow on the trigger but didnt have slowdown
	- For good reason I'm sure, the enemies dont come from the side of the screen.  like on 8-1 in the middle there are 3 koopas in a row and you're running and not expecting them to be there but then one or two tiles in from teh right they finally show up too late to respond. 
	- wow vice has netplay!!!
* Gauntlet C64
	- background.  One of the first games my parents ever bought specifically for me.  I was so enamored of this game every time i saw it in the arcade so when i figured out somehow that i could get it for my c64 i was so excited.  i remember sitting in the back of my parents station wagon opening the box on the way home and reading the manual.  i got it home and threw it in and enjoyed it but i really didnt play it that much.   i remember a feeling of disappointment and fear about it and now i think i know why.  I played it a few times and died and went back to the beginning fo teh game and the first time that happened it broke my damn 9 year old heart.  All of my progress lost?  i have to do something i cant do just to be able to explore the depths of this dungeon?  i should be able to beat this game but i'm not even good enough to survive for a few leevels.  i expected that you could put in more quarters to continue and my heart was broken by that too. i didnt understand the pattern of playing to practice and drawing maps and taking it seriously and figureing otu strategies i didnt think thats how games worked.  i nievely thought games were about exploration and having fun and taht i would be able to make significant progress and yeah if i died i would try a few more times until i beat it!  i was excited to explore the depths of that dungeon and i got way into the fantasy of it.  i didnt know the pattern of expecting to die and trying again and getting slowly better as the weeks go by.    most importantly i didn't understand that playing with the second player would give me effectively unlimited lives.  Also frankly I dont even know if we had two joysticks (yeah we did atari style). also I wanted people to play with me but I basically never did.  Did I ask anyone?  I have no idea.  Did anyone ask me?  no.  I didnt know that one player can tank and in this game the enemies target the first person they see more than the other player even when the other player gets closer. 
	- this is fun.  The shooting doesnt seem to be responding every time.  the loading takes for freaking ever.  the crack allows for unlimited life and level skip walls.  i remember if you stand there long enough teh walls change for you.  i dont like how unresponsive the shooting is but the movement is really quick and snappy and preciee i like that.  And the enemies look awesome i think the artists did a great job downscaling and recoloring the sprites especially the ghosts. iin hte cracktro theres a full manual and even a cool story by someone who played this for two months every monday with his local friends who traded disks in the 80s.   i think it even talked about instructions like about each of the mechanisms and enemies and characters and how to play it even has tips.  Because of the shooting slowness this isn't instantly that fun even though i want it to be.  
	- had to use the tilde key to continue from the cracktro it said to press the arrow but i remember that maybe it was up there.
	- When you die you start over at level 1 :(  at least theres no long loading.  BUT if before you die you push start on the 2player controller you can continue as that player.  Is there a hidden credits counter behind the scenes?  I dont know but this is still much better than just one life.  So as long as you keep an eye on your life you can beat the freaking game!  That makes it fair and like the arcade! (as long as theres no hidden credits counter which would be super shitty).  I fired it up again and am enjoying myself much more now.  
	- it appears that I dont have control over both players  even if I set both joysticks to keyset 2.  thats annoying.   BuT I can dual stick control both players with the triggers for fire and thats super fun!
	- What happens if one player goes down the exit and the remddaining one dies???  Answer: You go to the next level!!!  what happens to p1 keys when p1 dies?  does p2 get them?  Looks like no not att all.  My elf had 5 keys and when he died one key popped out.  maybe thats just to throw a bone?  
	- I'm having so much fun!  I'm elf and warrior and am on level 8!  Now I'm on 10 and shots stun the other players.  Is that true for the rest of the game?  Wow the stun lasts forever!  10-15s??? maybe you have to shake or shoot it off?  Nope level 11 doesnt stun!
	- I always thought the lobbers were weird.  I didnt know the word lob so it reminded me of log which didnt make sense. and also they look like little worms with snake arms so I didnt know wth they were except for the illustrations and descriptions in the manual.  
	- I do remember feeling pretty good about some of the strategies I used like being scared of death and running and trapping him somewhere occasionally.  Now I can do that without much trouble.  Its fun manipulating the ai.  
	- Lots of slowdown on level 11 and 12 13 is back up to full speed
	- lvl 16 crashed but it was different level the next time!  It has crashed ttwice now and boy thtat woudl have been a problem back in the day. not only the reloading time but you couldnt save at all back then so I would have to startt from the beginning :(  The treasure room the players move SO FAST.  No slowdown at all with just treasures. Interesting I cant be sure but it seems to crash after the treasure rooms.  Certainly did on the one around 30.  Twice in a row actually.  Three times.  But now i'm on 34 and saving every level in case it crashes. THe crash is usually: Level end go black -> disk activity -> activity stops but screen stays black (excep tfor names at bottom).  Its crashing repeatedly after level 62 or so.   Got past it when I killed one character.  DOnt know if that was related.  Near the end of the game its crashing between every 2-5 levels.  sometimes several times in a row.
	- I think its cool that in the arcade if you just sit there for a minute the walls turn to exits.  This assures you wont get stuck somewhere.  I'm glad this made it to the home version too.
	- I'm having success with making my elf my main character and my warrior into a tank.  
	- I remember learning that you could somewhat trap death in mazes and that you could somewhat influence the teleporters for you to squash him!
	- i think the treasure rooms timer moves way too fast
	- Another strat is to put p1 at one end of the room and p2 at near the other end, then move p1 1 square towards p2 and then have p2 move one square further basically slowly increasing the fog of war.  p2 might have to backc up first to make it scroll
	- its scary how fast death moves when there are no other enemies on the screen
	- A strategically placed key from one of your party's deaths can be a great blocker of enemies.  An interesting side effect of this is one time one of my characters died in a hallway and the other one had full keys.  There were no doors.  Would have had to wait for the exit walls then..
	- Sometimes in like the 50s levels a single encounter with a swarm can cost 300-500 health!
	- the game is programmed pretty well because i'm on 62 or so and there are tons of enemies and the slowdown is the worst Ive seen, and while it does affect the players speed and shot speed, it doesn't affect that nearly as much as the enemies movement and attack which is correct.  The enemies movement and attack should absolutely be slower than the players if something has to give and I find it hard to believe that it is unintentional.
	- Found a weird problem: I accidentally typed something not realizing i was in the game window.  it involved the m key for map and then I hit enter so it mapped 'autostart image' to whatever key I typed next.  The next key I typed was pressing the joystick left and then it was burned.  I cant un-do this.  I accidentally did it with the other direction too.  those keys were burned then (wasdf) so I changed the keyset to tfghj instead and now it works (as long as i dont accidentally do it a few more times).  the real problem here is I have no idea how to actually unmap that.  I could do it by resetting ALL of my settings to default and i will if I need to but theres got to be a better way and ideally while your game is still running
	- I found out there is a 1 pixel difference bettween poison cider and regular cider.  poison has a rounded handle regular has a sharp handle (its only one pixel so its hard to tell)
	- Another cool strat is if you find a invisibility one player distracts the bad boys and the other comes in aroudn the side and kills them all from behind. 
	- another strat is when you are overwhelmed pull your second player back to a distance to off screen as many enemies as possible.
	- I thought i would pop open the monitor and see what it was like!  well it was no information at all but f12 didnt work anymore (VICE keyboard menu is f12) so i typed quit and the whole thing crashed!!!  good thing I was done!
	- Beat it!  I read that the game goes on infinitely but there are 125 unique levels so I played to 126 and stopped. Ive got lots of saves.  This was great fun and I feel fulfilled.  I would have had to start over probably 25 times if I had been on real hardware which would have been endlessly frustrating.  I say that fully acknowledging that if it were running on real hardware theres a decent chance it woudlnt be crashing (the crashing could be related to the emulation - perhaps the model of C64 I've been using).  there hasn't been any reliable crashing.  still Idid it!  I'm proud and fulfilled!!!
* Idris Alpha C64 (1/3/2021)
	- Jeff Minter game!  I cant get it running.  Fire doesnt do anything.  Maybe pal/ntsc problem?
	- the disk version just doesn't seem to accept joystick start input.  it gets to the main menu ok though.  I played it a bit a few years back and didnt love it so I think I 'll give up.  Wait there might be a tape?
	- one interesting thing it blanks the s whenever a key is pressed thats really a bad ass way to respond to input.  
	- I tried the tape and am giving up.  	

* Simpsons Arcade C64 (1/4/2021)
	- I used the exact same input settings as for gauntlet with my ps4 controller (basically: set tfghj to p1 and okl;' to p2 and then use Enjoyable to send those keypresses from the sticks and trigger button) 
	- I'm concerned about the continue structure but the crack has unlimited lives option.  if its not unlimited continues built in then thats just bs.  	- If I autoload it loads INSTANTLY even though its on a disk!  I didnt know that and I wonder if it would work with other games too?
	- Its super playable!  Ive only fought a few guys but at least as 8 bit games go the fundamental fighting is good and playable and fun!  PLUS I'm playing 2p at once marge and lisa and its fun!  
	- The intro and cutscenes are pretty damn incredible honestly.    The bosses are big.  The balloon boss is so big and looks so great!
	- the in game graphics are totally serviceable. the characters are about as clear as they could be expected to be and although theyre not perfect they're good representations like marge's face doesn't look GOOD per se and her eyes are kind of messed up but the animation of her hair is great!  her vaccuum isn't big enough graphically imho but it works just fine.  
	- The control scheme they came up with is workable enough for one button.  Jump by holding the button down.  Whats interesting is how much more dynamic games could have been for amiga and c64 with standard 2 button support.  holding the button to jump makes it so you cant reasonably be expected to use fast paced dynamic action and it means it cant be attacked just like the arcade game.  So you can't like practice the arcade game by playing this, but you can enjoy a simpsons game with the same story and set pieces and with different but fun fighting mechanics.  Its not responsive enough to expect repeated precise split second actions compared to beat em ups on other systems.  It seems pretty forgiving for me playing with unlimited lives, but if there were limited lives and continues, and this control sloppiness and imprecision thats pretty silly and doesnt let you go into the game just beating people up and kicking ass.  
	- The sound is kind of terrible but maybe a good job of copying the song from the arcade but its grating. ALso just like with Knight n grail it is turning off a lot.  OH!  Maybe that means its also being distorted by the same problem?  Maybe its not as bad as it sounded to me.
	-  I seem to be doing best by standing both players in the same place and spamming attack and then moving.  
	- If you are on top of screen and press left or right thats fine but if you are using a joystick (which people would have been in 1993) and if it registers up and right it will get stuck on hte wall it doesnt slide . kind of a minor thing but clumsy and means when I'm playing both characters and lose attention for a sec they get stuck on the wall and dont move and get hit.
	- attention to detail: in moes tavern theres a coin op simpsons game.  It only has pictures of the players who are playing rn.  on the outdoor level theres an animated waterfall!
	- On the dreamland level the enemies which are in the air are really annoying with this control scheme and too hard to hit with precision.  Throughout its hard to kknow when you are hit or when they get hit.  its all sloppy and thats ok as long as they dont make it so hard as to expect precision which the air enemies and some bosses are.
	- This game didnt crash once.  If I had bought this and given it a chance by not comparing it too harshly to the arcade, and if it had unlimited continues I would have enjoyed myself and it would have been worth the money!
	- The third burns boss phase isnt fair.  Is there a way to beat it without dying over and over?  I have my doubts
	- VICE Seems to save the keysets in the actual settings themselves.  
	- When you beat the game or die and get a high score it does save those to disk and they are saved for next time even after a reset.
	- Update: I just tested it without the cheat and you get 4 or 5 lives and then its game over. no continues at fucking all.  Facepalm
* Adventures of Batman and Robin Batvantage Rom Hack 1/5/2021
	- wow what a game!  I watched Pugman and Chippants play this on PugmanPlays on youtube and it was so cool, but so terribly frustrating I found out there is a rom hack that fixes the game by giving the players max weapon power and it sure does!  its still challenging when it gets to teh swamp level which is where i used my first continue.  All of the bosses were easy and on the shooting level I even gained a few lives because it was so fun and easy.  All of it is fun.  it would be no fun at all with underpowered weapons.  the devs really messed that part up imho.. 
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7_EufEtknI
	- Wow I beat it today 1/6/2021 it was fun!  I think I could beat the whole game on 2 continues with a bit of practice.  The mushroom swamp level was by far the hardest.  Only the final boss took more than 1 life.  
* DocXMaS c64  1/5/2021
	- Damn this is cool but its broken by having only 5 lives.  thats a really confusing design decision.  It restarts you in teh room like modern games but doesnt give you unlimited lives
* Blockheads c64 1/5/2021
	- This is a great / terrible super difficult platforming game where I cant even beat level 1 ... i could but its super hard and not fun
* luna a witch em up c64 1/5/2021
	- I like it but ... one life???
* RainbowEdgeRun C64 1/5/2021	
	- Its really fun and addictive, but its one life so not that compelling
* Santron c64 1/5/2021
	- Really fun!  Satisfying to play.  Pacbilly kicked ass at this.  Its only got 3 lives tho so the playability is super limited :( sad imho.  it could have been great.  same with many of these c64 games.  I really like figuring out the patterns and getting better but without SOME checkpoints I feel like its a waste putting my time inot this ... hmm I could use save states ...hmm ...
	- A funny quirk of using enjoyable with this ds4 controller: if you set the analog button on the bak to low and hi of the same letter then it never goes low.  If you want to hold down akey constantly then thats a way to do it..  its got  alow and hi setting I wonder if I can set the hi setting to turn it off and the low to turn it on.  I noticed if you set r1 and r2 low and hi to the same key then you can turn it on with the analog and off with the digital
	- I got to level 2 pretty easily.  I really like this game.
* Gauntlet Tengen NES 1/10/2021
	- This is fun. its clumsier than hte c64 in some ways the graphics are less ... i dont know. but it usually moves faster and its fun.  Apparently there is an actual end at 100 and eacch treasure room acctually if you escape you get hta much life back up to 980 atm theres an achcievement at level 10 and I am on that level now so I should be able to get it.  it actually seems do able ..then agin apparently the last 25 levels are brutal and a game in and of themselves.  then again tehre is apparently a password system?  maybe when you pause?	
	- level 10 800 life 555-218-8L8	
	- level 11 666-w66-663
	- The retroachievements were not enabled. If you turn them off and then on even if your password is wrong they will say they are enabled.  
	- The treasure rooms are way more fair.  its not too hard to find the exit in these
	- I hate the bouncy axe and hope that it goes away immediately because it means that I am defenceless for a long time while its bouncing around doing nothing.  ive lost a ton of life to having that "weapon powerup"
	- I'm on level 10  - got it!  I beat level 10 with like 80 life to go i got 100 more power right before the end of the level.  holy crap 5s into level 11 I'm dead!!! 
	- I'm on the spider level with valkyrie on normal mode and ive tried it 5 times and all of a sudden its not fun anymore.  its too hard.  the boss was hard but thsi is even harder.  
* Heavy Metal Machines PC 1/11/2021
	- Wow this is cool.  A MOBA which reminds me on paper of rocket league but its like rock n roll racing and really cool.
	- The weapons are all different and interesting so I had a hard time figuring out how to use them.  
	- Gamepad support works just fine, but switching between mouse and gamepad is clumsy/buggy.  I bump a key with the cable of my gamepad and all of a sudden mouse takes over and I cant play with gamepad until it decides to recognize it again.  
	- the weapons are hard to figure out.  Each character has unique weapons and I think to enjoy this I'm going to need to figure out one character that I like that has the weapons I want.  Frankly I want simple missiles, mines, and boost!
	- in order for me to like this I'm going to have to play it a lot.  Actually since its not a huge game maybe I could get really good at it in time?  maybe I could become one of the best?
	- Atm I do not like this but I want to like it SO MUCH.

1. Wonder Boy 3
2. Carmen Sandiego
3. Double Dragon
4. Phantasy Star
5. Hang On/Jungle Hunt (built in)
6. Castle of Illusion starting Mickey Mouse


## PSX Games ##
I loved these games from the PSX:
1. Final Fantasy VII (this was so epic and I felt like a serious gamer playing this.  Beat this summer 1998)
2. Metal Gear Solid (Same as FF7) (rented and beat this fall 1998/spring 1999)
3. Resident Evil 2 (Same as FF7) (rented and beat this fall 1998/spring 1999)
4. Castlevania Symphony of the Night
5. Jet Moto 2 (Beat this Spring 1999 - really hard to beat this)
6. Gex (Beat this Spring 1999 - It was some work to do it - really hard)
7. Ridge Racer Type 4 (Great memories of renting this and thinking how much like GT it was but how it was slightly more edgy or something)
8. Gran Turismo (This was so cool when I rented it a few times, maybe I even rented the second one)
9. Suikoden (Beat this Summer 2000 when I was playing DWIV at the same time with the other hand)
10. Tomba (I think I rented it and loved it in part but didnt buy it until much later - In like 2010 I played about half of this - I owned the 2nd game for a while too)
11. Time Crisis (I beat it in 2000)
12. Klonoa (I beat this in the 2000s but I dont know whether it was the one on the Wii? I played through half of Klonoa 2 on PS2 as well but never finished it.)
14. Xenogears (I played through about half of this and was loving it so much playing it every night as I was going to sleep, but unfortunately my memory card died and I lost all of my progress :( it was one of those fancy high capacity memory cards) its a 60 hr game and I feel like I want to play it again and finally finish it 
15. I played a ton of Brave Fencer Mushashi and loved it but I got stuck and gave up and never came back to it.  
16. Um Jammer Lammy was amazing but it was very hard so I never beat it unfortunately
17. Soul Blade probably my favorite on the system I unlocked all of the characters even the secrets.  
18. Wipeout XL I played the hell out of this and I feel like I beat it but I dont remember when or what that would have really meant
19. Spyro the Dragon - Betsy got me hooked on this but I beat it on my own it was very fun exploring this awesome 3d world.  I loved it so much and remember the final boss. I owned the 2nd and 3rd game at one point but never played either except enough to fly around a bit I remember that. 
20. Final Fantasy 8 (Got about halfway through this actually)
21. Twisted Metal 2 - I played about half of this in the 2000s but never beat it and certainly didnt play it enough bitd, but what a great game in every sense.  Multiplayer was epic.  
22. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver - I played this for a bit on PSX, but then decided the DC version was the one to play and beat the whole game on Dreamcast.  It seemed like it took an eternity and it probably did but it was a really cool game.
23. Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain - I remember playing this at Lyndie's house and it was so damn cool, I remember the load times being really annoying and not knowing where to go after a while and getting stuck, but I got many hours in proabably half way through it and it was really really cool and I loved the lore.  I think there were problems with it loading or something. 

I Always wanted to play or master these from the PSX:
1. Parasite Eve (Don't really know why I didnt play and beat this because I wanted it so bad) (Had a demo of it which I loved very much)
2. Vagrant Story - I owned this at one point in the 2000s without a case but never really played it
3. Chrono Cross
5. Final Fantasy 9 - I owned this but never played it more than for just a few minutes.  
6. Wing Commander 3 (or 4?) (I bought it at Hastings hoping Betsy and I could play it together but it didnt load :( 
7. Everything in me said I should get Lunar: The Silver Star Complete collection for PSX but for some reason I never jumped on it.  I bet I would have freaking loved it.  It came with a map too!
8. Suikoden 2 - never bought this one
9. Time Crisis Project Titan - I owned this but only played it for a few minutes.  It was cool although it didnt draw me in quite like the first . there wanst anything wrong but the first one was so damn cool and immersive as a bad ass and this one didnt make me feel the same way.
10. All other Guncon games - I owned most of them in the 2000s but hardly played any of them.  
11. Tenchu Stealth Assassins - I had this for a while and it was so cool
12. Einhander - Same It was really cool but I didnt spend much time with it unfortunately
13. Gradius V - Dust had this and I played it at his work and it was just so cool with that awesome 3D (Wasnt there a darius game?  Wasnt there a space fish?)
14. Ergheiz - I loved this for a few days and thought it was so cool
15. Parappa the Rapper was pretty fun for a while.
16. Frequency - Dust said it was great
17. Tekken 2 I played a bit of and it was really cool.  I hardly played 3 at all.
18. Alundra - Dust or Chuck had this and showed it to me and MAN I loved it so much just seeing the pictures of it. 
19. Bushido Blade - I had some real fun with this for a few days because it was so cool it seemed like a strategy fighting game to me at the time, but I didnt get very far. 


I'm interested in these FMV Games from the PSX:
1. X Files (both recommended on a cannot be tamed video comment)

## PSP ##

(Might be able to get these working on Stereoscopic!)

1. Ultimate Ghosts n Goblins
2. Killzone Liberation (2006 Dual Stick Shooter Dungeon Crawl)

## PS2 ##
pcsx2 apparently has 3d sbs!

1. 

## WiiU ##
Wii-U WiiU games that might be able to be Stereoscopic
Update: not dolphin: CEMU wiht Reshade 3.0
* Nano Assault Neo (Wii-U) Possibly in Dolphin could get stereoscopic working and this would be an amazing twin stick shooter in 3d!
* Kirby Rainbow Curse WiiU Would be SO MUCH FUN (although would need a stylus somehow - wouldnt really work with mouse)
* Super Mario 3D World WiiU I loved 3D Land so much I would love this one
* Wind Waker HD WiiU Could get stereoscopic working in Dolphin perhaps?
* Rayman Legends WIiU
* New Super Mario Bros U
* Xenoblade Chronicles X
* Bayonetta
* Shovel Knight
* Captain Toad Treasure Tracker
* Mario Galaxy 1 & 2 (Wiimote problems perhaps?)
* Zelda Twilight Princess HD WiiU
* Starfox Zero
* Yoshis Wooly World
* Yoshis Crafted World
* Sonic Lost World
* New Super Luigi U



## Game Gear games to consider trying ##
1. GG Aleste Game Gear / Powerstrike 2 Game Gear
2. Streets of Rage 1 & 2 on Game Gear
3. Panzer Dragoon Mini

## RPGs ##

### Classic RPGs ###
1. Xenogears
2. Vampire Bloodlines (See cannot be tamed video).  30-40h according to Pam and I bet it would take me that long too, maybe ther are cheats?   Apparently there are a bunch of unofficial patches even in 2019.  
3. The Witcher 3


## Light Gun Games ##
http://www.arcadeguns.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=48&products_id=314&zenid=a6og89k4nbaq2cv0eed11ol7k2

I love playing light gun games in VR by far best.  Its by far the best light gun like experience I've ever had.  
But I wonder if it would be fun to play emulated games with actual modern light guns as if they were mice.  That would be compatible with almost any emulated game.  Arcadeguns.com has them.  about $125 each

On my mind atm 7/27/2020 later 10/18/2020

----------------------------

 Games on iOS with MFi gamepad
4. -------I know I can beat these------------
4. Wonder Boy the Dragons Trap, 5. Shantae (Own), 11. Geometry Wars 3 (own but only on mini ipad as it was taken down from teh app store), 8. Rayman Adventures (Own)
4. -------These look awesome but new and I have some doubts------------
8. Goblin Sword (own), 9. Kick Ass Commandos (Wow this is amazing!) (own), 12. Wayward SOuls (RPG like FF3 but Roguelike) (possibly too hard), 6. Dan the Man (Own) great battle game, 16. Toon Shooter 2 (Own), 17. Xenowerk (Own), 18. Xenoraid (Own), 15. Max (own), 11. Binding of Isaac (Own)
4. -------Play if you want Ive done a lot with these before------------
3. VVVVVV (Own), 7. Hyper Sentinel (Own), 14. Goat Simulator (own), 10. Horizon Chase (Own on PC but it plays perfect on here), 8. Space Miner (own) (Note: even though I purchased this in the past, and even though gameclub registers that I have a controller, and even though it restores my purchases and unlocks the full version without a sub, the controller doesnt work), 
4. -------Less Longevity Below - still fun------------
18. Death Worm Free (Own), 9. Crossy Road (Own), 7. Alto's Adventure (Own), 6. Slayin (Own), 10. Silverfish DX (own) Bought for $4 - not really worth it.  Great arcade game somewhat like Geom wars (without the shooting).  but with just the one game mode its just too shallow, 9. Super Crate Box (own)



Games I figured out worked well on my own: Rayman Adventures, Shantae, Dan the Man, Horizon Chase, Hyper Sentinel, Crossy Road, Binding of Isaac



 Games on iOS without gamepad
1. Spend another few tries to beat that dungeon strategy game, 2. Mario Run

 Dont: Games that SHOULD and its frustrating that they dont: Castle of Illusion, PacMan 256, Dig Out, APOX-X



 Little Indie
2. Never Stop Sneaking - by the Dust developer and like Metal Gear Solid but a parody with a sense of humor, 1. Saving Princess - I love the look of this game, it looks like a cool modern metroid game -but I missed my shot on the app store.  still available for PC though on itch, 1. Crimsonland, 2. Dragon Sinker (Looks just like DW NES), 3. Agent Aliens, 4. Gunslugs 2, 5. Gris, 6. Legacy Quest (Like diablo or lego Hobbit), 7. Super Kung Fu All-Star (cool 3d combat), 10.Sword of Fargoal, 11.Fez

So Minigore or super crate box controller support costs ... $5/month?  Holy shit! Maybe becasue I bought the full version before it gave it to me for free? both of those work without any 5/month problem (Unless I'm already paying it???)


 Big Indie
9. Dust: An Elysian Tail, 1. Limbo, 2. Batman The ENemy Within, 3. Dead Cells, 4. Aquaria, 5. Stardew Valley, 6. Bastion, 7. Transistor, 8. Crashlands (DiabloGame)



 Big Commercial
1. Final Fantasy VI (50h), 2. Sonic CD , 3. Secret of Mana (20h), 4. Wonderboy 3 The Dragons Trap, 5. The Bards Tale (20h) 6. Duck Tales Remastered, 11. Bioshock
7. --------------
1. Castlevania Symphony of the Night, 9. Minecraft, 10. Star Wars: KOTOR,



Investigate:
"Here are the ones I'm playing or played in the past and enjoyed: Playdead's Inside, , Grimvalor, Dandara, The Witness, , Pascal's Wager, Evoland, Evoland 2, , , Leo's Fortune, Thumper, Don't Starve, Oceanhorn, , , , The Silent Age, Kingdom: New Lands, Graveyard Keeper, Lovecraft's Untold Stories, , Super Fancy Pants Adventure, LifeAfter.

Metroidvania 8/8/2020
---------------------------

I loved watching qwerty playing Castlevania Circle of the Moon

4. VVVVVV (steresocopic) (rumored to work on citra)
5. Cave Story (stereoscopic) (Citra works)
6. Metroid Samus Returns 3DS (stereoscopic) 
7. Steamworld Dig 1 & 2 3DS Stereoscopic (Citra)

CHORE GAMES 12/5/2020
----------------------------------------------------
Games that seem or feel like a chore in some or any way but I still have good reason to play them, Play all of these games with step by step walkthroughs or cheats, Dont know how to list Zelda games: Use Walkthroughs, Use Cheats, etc.  Other games that seem like a chore, Games I will probably never finish: Spiderweb games that I started, MetroidPrime, I dont think I trust zelda and metroid games to not put things in places way out of the box of my brain and things like that dont please me honestly  I also dont trust them to not put me into situations that are too hard for me to handle.  Boss battles every so often should take many tries thats fine.  

- Small PracticeBurdens: Contra, NinjaGaiden, Castlevania, ShinobiIII, Sonic 1 3DS, Volgarr, SwordofSodan
- Retroachievements: Zelda2,
- 3DSen Zelda2, 
- Wii/GC Stereoscopic: TwilightPrincess, WindWaker
- Stereoscopic 3DS: Ocarina
- Would love to play Suikoden again with cheats to make it easy, also FF7 and Alundra and ParasiteEve and the like
- CastlevaniaGBA(Cheats), 
- Shantae, Same with Shantae games although I love them so much 
- Achievements: Volgarr the Viking	
- Long VR RPG
	- VanishingRealmsVR, SkyrimVR, SubnauticaVR, GTA5VR, EliteDangerousEpic, Minecraft, 
- Sports:
	- Amiga: The fact is about these I'm going to suck for a long time. GOAL!, SensibleSoccer, KickOff2, But I would love to get to the point where I could beat the computer reliably in goal on every level, but thats a big goal for starters Id like to beat the computer reliably on even the EASY level!  That would actually be a really fun goal and would let me feel really good about it.
	- Championship Baseball - I would love to get good enough to take my 1989 cubs to the world series in this specific game
	- C MLB Power Pros Wii
- Stereoscopic 3DS: MetroidSamusReturns(15h),
