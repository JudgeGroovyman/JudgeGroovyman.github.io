# Dont own but might want to #
1. Red Faction: Guerrilla - "Bringing destructibility and absolute fun"  "Being able to put explosives in one part of a building and watch it crumble because of your expert placement is more fun than you know"  does that guy have an ostrich?  
2. Uncharted 2 through 4 - I'm pretty sure I would love these to death.  I sure loved the first one.  


# Doom #
to play GZDoom with wads:
Or apparently you can drag and drop if the doom2.wad and doom.wad are in the same folder as the gzdoom


### Options ###
1. Right click gzdoom.exe and create shortcut
2. Right click the shortcut and hit properties
3. in the target field add: `-iwad DOOM2.wad -file Valiant.wad -savedir Valiant`

* Or make a .bat file with the same command
* Optionally add +logfile ValiantLog.txt
* If you dont have doom.wad or doom2.wad then use [FreeDoom](https://freedoom.github.io/)

### In game console commands ###
1. noclip nomonsters notarget on off
2. maplist
3. map map01
4. fly
5. give ammo
6. regenhealth on

### Configuring GZDoom ###
I had to do some substantial configuration to get my DS4 controller which works with every game on mac wirelessly to work even wired with GZDoom.  It didnt work wirelessly at all.  I had to set all of the button settings in the config to figure out what buttons were what but then some I had to set manually (specifically the fire button) in the gzdoom.ini file because strangely they didnt all reflect in the in game configuration GUI.  In the configure controller I had to set axis 1 to strafing, axis 2 to moving forward, axis 3 to turning, and axis 4 to looking up down and set the overall sensitivity on that one to 0. and invert it.  


## Doom Wads ##
1. Valiant - wow this is wonderful.  The level design is great and had many moments of scary stuff jumping out at me when I entered a new room or flipped a switch.  The enemies they throw at you are hard but not too hard (I'm playing on difficulty 3/5) and the level was really interestingly laid out with lots of secrets that made me feel clever for finding them.  I just beat level one and it took me about 15 minutes doing it leisurely but I'm sure it actually took more due to save states. Update 10/29/2019
 I just beat level 7 The Manchubian Candidate and all of the levels were really good.  It ended with some cool text exposition and then just kind of puts you in the menu which I think means I should start the next campaign in this wad.  They're all really good the way I play which is to be a bit careful and use lots of save states but I feel like I would have to be a lot better at the game to get anywhere on my first life.  Wow level 2.2 probably took me 2h (the game said 45 min but I had to start over many many times).  It is a puzzle just to try to survive the hordes and its very fun all along.  Level 2.3 took me 1:53 according to the game. In real world time looking at svae states ... 3h15m wow.  I'm proud of myself though.  I am having some doubts that I will be able to beat later levels at all if they get harder (which given that I'm only 1/4 through they surely will get harder).   Finished Level 9: Implosion.  really cool level.

## Marathon ##
- A competitor for Mac was Marathon [modern version recently updated](https://alephone.lhowon.org/) by Bungie and I would probably have a blast playing it 

# Crossplay VR #

6. Trackmania Turbo - this sounds like too much fun!!!
1. No Mans Sky comes out on VR for all platforms cross-play this Wednesday.  Its an enormous space sim where you can explore a whole galaxy. https://www.roadtovr.com/no-mans-sky-vr-psvr-announcement/ but its probably super complicated
2. Star Trek Bridge Crew (I own this now but have only played it once and didnt get anywhere
3. Rec Room, remember that time we played a quest or mission or whatever?  I can't say my performance held any water but it was a cool adventure and I would totally do that again.  Plus we could rock the battle royale feature that all the teenagers are playing these days.  They will totally snipe us from 200 miles the first few times we play but we might be able to figure out ways to hadoken the hell out of them.
4. Eve Valkyrie - Cross Platform Space Battle Sim
5. Sports Bar VR - Like Rec Room but more realistic looking
8. VRChat (Is this PSVR?)
9. Eagle Flight
10. Werewolves Within


## Other Multiplayer ##
1. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes
I think with Big Screen sharing enabled this might work.  Probably thats too much for the computer to handle though.

In other news I bought Skyrim VR (haven't played yet) and I just beat a game called Bloodstained Something or other of the Night which was made by the same guy who made Castlevania Symphony of the Night and it was really cool and I might play it again.

# Notes from around Christmas 2018 and January 2019
Strider (NES) Jan 6 2019 - finished in under 15min using this speed run approach:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HU3H_N4C14
It was really fun to do it this way and it made me feel good.


Zelda II - The Adventure of Link - In 1990 when I was 12 I rented an NES for the first time in Park City Utah with two games: This and Mario 2. I got somewhere in Mario 2, but in this game I really didn't get that far.  I rented it later on too and got further because some of my friends had given me clues in the intervening months.  I remember getting to the horse head boss probably once maybe twice (I might have done that on someone else save file tbh) I got through the southwest cavern without the candle once or twice (it was very hard).  I would have got the candle but was so confused and overwhelmed I couldn't for the life of me figure out how!?!  I remember getting the jump but I don't think I could even figure out how to use it without help from friends (even with the manual!). Maybe I did figure that out but I remember it being very hard.  I also remember getting to the high wall and not knowing "am I going the right way and just don't have the right skills, or is there another way that I could go right now that I have all the skills???)  I also didnt understand the RPG elements at all so I was never powerful whatsoever even though I remember powering up a bit. I didnt understand that those elements were continued between games.  I remember seeing "I am Error" and legitimately thinking that my copy of the game was broken and had a serious programming or hardware glitch and thats why I couldn't get any further!  That made me feel better about not being able to get anywhere (for a while at least)  I remember thinking the little cave in the northeast with one enemy was really hard!?! 

 To be fair to John 1990 this was all very new to me.  We had an Atari so I had played some of that, but I was never that kid who sat in front of it for hours playing over and over, and we didn't really have many games you could do that with anyway ( I had never heard of adventure, and I my parents had bought Mario bros for Atari (not super) and I was real proud but I never got to spend all that much time with it because someone had stolen it out of my pencil box soon after).  I also had an interesting attitude about arcade style games: It seemed like if I had played pac man for a while then that was good enough because there weren't any new skills to learn  (that I could identify with my 12yo mind)  or levels or worlds to see just move around and dodge things.     I got pretty into Midnight Magic pinball though.  We had a C64 but the games on that were really different and I hadn't really dug deeply into them.  I hadn't played many arcade games either.  And regardless of all this gaming experience: all of my gaming had been with a n Atari joystick.  

Fundamentally there were a few things that were genuinely new to me: 1. Using a flat controller to try to deftly maneuver the character around the screen:  I didn't have an NES until probably Christmas 1992 and didn't buy this game until I was an adult.  At friends houses I had played Mario and duck hunt and elevator action, ghosts and goblins, wizards and warriors, and maybe one or two other games on NES that I don't remember (My friend Byron DID have ROB the robot but I remember he didn't want to set it up so I saw it and touched it but never got to see it in action), but if you counted up the controller time I had had by this point across all of those games (all at other peoples houses) it probably totaled to around 1 hour.  2 would have been pushing it. Probably the closest I had come to the platforming in Zelda 2 that I had spent any time with was Pitfall (and at the time I found maneuvering to the eyeballs of the alligators so hard it was scary to even try to do it!) and the precision, dexterity, multitasking, button manipulation, etc. required in Zelda 2 is light years beyond pitfall so my basic controller/platforming skills were vastly out of their depth.  2. I had never really been so over my head before.  At anything.  It was frustrating and confusing, and I didn't have enough information about what I was supposed to be doing for me to figure it out and probably my biggest problem was I really had no coping skills for dealing with my frustration.  I didnt know when to give up and say I wasn't good enough at it or that I couldn't figure it out, or when to keep going back to the same places over and over to see if I could find the one little thing I was missing.  I didnt know how much backtracking might be required (I wasn't familiar with backtracking at all really so I thought it must be the wrong way).  I had heard about some games requiring you to make maps, but even to my 12 year old mind that seemed like ancient technology that shouldn't be required in this modern era.  I couldn't fathom having to take notes or make a map for myself on paper (even though that would have solved most of my problems) and because of this misunderstanding about what kind of involvement was required and what should be handed to me on a silver platter even later when I went to play some old text adventures I hesitated making maps and suffered as a result) As a result of all this I didnt spend enough time with it to get good at it or to figure out what to do.  I had no one to talk about it with. I could talk to my friends days or weeks later around the lunch table and ask around.  I didnt understand that magazines were in many cases so important, and I didn't know which one to get anyway, not to mention I always felt like even if I got some magazine there would be something key missing that was in a previous issue but I wouldn't know that and the fear of that made me mostly ignore those magazines for tips and tricks (I loved magazines but mostly to get me excited about getting other new games!).  I played with my sister as much as I could but she was 3 years younger and I couldn't figure out any of it so we were both in the dark. 
	 If I had an NES and the game, had more time to beat my head against a wall, and had friends with whom I could talk about where the candle was and what secrets we had all found, or if I had Nintendo power, I might have been ok.  Or if I had eased in with some other games that were more similar, or if I had better platforming skills, ... I have no idea how I could have gotten to horsehaead and I wonder if I just invented that or saw it in a magazine (I did have a magazine with a walkthrough but I was so young and dumb that I didnt put it all together and use it to play the game!  I also had some kind of snobby attitude about it like I *should* be able to beat it without any hints from any magazine.  Little did I know...  I know I made it to that palace and I spent many hours trying to beat it but I never did.    When I rented it back then it was back in the day when they rented out the manual with the game.  I remember poring over that manual so long I might have spent more time with it than I did with the game (since I was pretty frustrated since I couldn't get anywhere with it!)   
Now none of this mattered to my heart because even though I had very little time with the controller and sucked big time at friends houses I was drawn deep into the game worlds and so heavily hooked from the first time I played Super Mario. So when I finally got to rent my OWN NES I was so excited that its impossible to describe or even feel some magic like that anymore.

In 1999 when I went back to Utah for the summer I started playing it again believing I could beat it on my own.  I got further than I ever did as a kid: I beat the first palace but thats about it.  I don think I got the hammer without tips from my friend.  I played the first part on my own, the second part with tips, and the rest I played it with Charles Orians who when I complained about how impossible it is encouraged me and thought I could beat it.  I did but for much of it (especially the end) I used the Game Genie and I still didn't know what was going on, he helped me solve all of the puzzles and figure out where to go and what to do (since even at that point as an adult I would have had no idea nor would have been able to figure it out on my own).  I had beaten all of the 2d Mario games by that point so I had some platforming chops but the intricate combat was still difficult for me and he beat some of the hardest parts.    It was really nice of him to play it with me and walk me through it and super fun to play with him.  

This time around I have a digital map with labels on it for where everything is, I have Mike Matei's stream recording plus several speed runs on youtube, and most importantly I have almost 30 years of experience programmed into my hands of playing platform games on a controller and now its really fun!  Having seen some people do it all pretty quickly and seen the moves they make and the paths they take and I feel much more of a command over the game. I bet its taken me 8 hours so far but I feel like I could play this all again in half the time.  I remember in 1999 getting completely lost in the palaces and now even though I haven't looked at maps, they aren't too bad.  I guess my brain is better at doing the job of mapping these things now for some reason.


Rygar (NES) Dec 5 2018 - This is simply a fantastic game.   - play more

Strider (Genesis) Nov 15 2018 - This was fun.  Short when you play it with rewind.  It took me maybe 90 min on and off.collision was weird in parts but generally pretty good.  The freedom of movement in this game was unmatched at the time I remember it well.  It was so much fun just jumping and swinging and launching and flipping.  With that said the levels sometimes (a handful of times) required you to know just what to do or when to jump or you would fall into ap it and die.  Theres not complete control mid air so you have to make sideways jumps just right.  Very fun though with cool enemies and bosses (my favorite is the sickle snake)

TMNT The Hyperstone Heist (Genesis) Nov 15 2018 - This is a great fun game! I played with rewind but didnt' have to use it THAT much and I believe I could beat it in a few hours without.  I played the SNES game Turtles in Time and while I can see that it is a hair 'better' I enjoyed this game better!  I have nothing against the SNES game.  This one feels more like I want it to feel though, namely: Like TMNT The Arcade Game.  The SNES one doesn't feel authentic because of the story and the characters.   It doesn't feel canon imho.  It never did to me which is probably why I never fell in love with it even in the arcade.  It felt fake, cheap, like a stretch.  As a game I can see its qualities but as a TMNT game I preferred this one and had more fun with it.  One thing really bugged me about this: Collision Detection on some of the traps.  The sharp bamboo that came out of the floor had an enormous surrounding box (probably a huge rectangle for simplicity) that made it difficult and unreasonable to avoid and the huge balls that come bouncing around didnt bounce high enough to have a good way to clear them (you could time it and run under them though).  Otherwise all of the enemies even the bosses were pretty good.  I think they should have had fewer of the white foot clan who block constantly because they just slowed the action down too much. Then again maybe theres an easy way to beat them super quick that I didnt figure out.  Overall I loved it.  Most of all I LOVED the music.  Especially the song at the end when you win!  Its Pizza Power from the Out of our Shells tour!!! So cool!!! Would play again a thousand times!  In fact this is the game I would have loved to have on the Genesis back in the day. If I were buying one then for myself I would get this and Strider.  It makes me want to get one now and those two games!  It took me 59:18 sec according to the game clock.


Wolfchild (Sega Master System) (Oct 11 2018) - This is a slow paced game but its fair and pretty fun.  
Wolfchild (Genesis) (Oct 11 2018) - Compared to the Master System this has rudimentary cutscenes, Parallax scrolling, same levels, enemies are more sophisticated and fun, the whole game feels alive in comparison, the boss took way too many hits imho.  Its fun!  I tried level 1 again without rewind with easy mode and 6 lives options and I beat it easily on two lives.  now its cool because when you die on the boss you start right before the boss.  its also interesting that shooting as the wolfchild seems to be way worse (because its slow) on the bosses than punching reallhy fast from up close.  
Oh weired it doesnt refill your life when you start level 2!?!  When you get the wolf powerup you get full life so its ok.  
This is a way better game than Sega Master System
(SG17) Beat the game on Nov 5



Rastan (Sega Master System) (Oct 11 2018) - This isn't very good tbh.  I thought I would like it but its totally stale and stiff, the controls are ok, but the enemies are totally cheap which makes it not fun.  I played a level or two and beat a boss (which was lifeless and uninspired) and you cant beat anything without taking hits.  Makes it not fun.

The Addams Family (TurboCD Oct 10 2018) - This is a shitty game. The controls are slippery stiff and slow, the enemy AI is almost non existant, the game structure is illogical and confusing, the whole premise of being the familys lawyer is absurd, the voice acting is probably just one or two actors, theres virtually nothing related to the movie, virtually none of the game could be beat without taking damage.  No continues.  I beat it with just TONS of rewind.  

Batman Returns (Game Gear) - Really cool game but sticky rope controls.  The branching paths on every level make for a ton of replay value though!
Super Return of the Jedi (Game Gear) Sep 23 - Amazing on this platform!!!  Will come back and beat this.  Its not stupid hard like the SNES one and you continue from the stage you left off on unlimited continues  - play more - The Speeder chase kind of sucks.  How collision works is not clear at all for you or the enemies making it really difficult.  Its not that fun with rewind and I would have hated to play this without rewind.  Enemies and trees pop up out of nowhere from the front and the back.  Ok when you get used to it its not horrible just clumsy.  I beat that level in about 10 min.  
Its cool that you get to play as Wicket!  On these levels do not try to kill everything.  hit detection is bad and enemies take tons of damage.  just move forward generally up and to the right.  the boss is way too much life and therefore way too difficult
I'm playing a Han Solo level now and its cool and I'm having fun.  Most levels you can choose your player which increases replay value.  HOWEVER:  This is a game I would despise and just not play if it werent for rewind.  Even with save states I wouldn't play it because it would be too unforgiving to be fun.  The boss here was hard but fortunately nothing like the last  boss!  
On the next level its Luke time and theres a long tunnel where you can't possibly avoid getting hit over and over.  You also have to make your way back out too.  The only value of goign down the tunnel is an extra life but you will certainly use a life to get that life.  grr.  THen theres a platform that is partially hidden and you can barely see, and there is an enemy right at the bottom that you cant kill without getting hurt and the platform lowers down to get to just where you can just barely land on it but only if you jump really high and at the perfect time.  the lowest part of its arc is the highest point you can jump so you've got to be perfect.  
Oct 4 Beat it!  Especially the last few levels were too hard.  THe flying level I would have died so much.  thats probably true for the whole game tbh.

Journey From Darkness: Strider Returns (Game Gear) - Clumsy and not worth playing although impressive for what it is.

Vampire: Master of Darkness: (Game Gear) The most amazing castlevania like game.  It is its own game but takes cues from Castlevania and is a bit of a masterpiece! - play more
Columns 3 (Genesis) - Cool that its got a single player mode but it really didnt pull me in but if I had been looking for a puzzle game back then it probably would have!
Rastan Saga II (Genesis) - Not saying it looks LIKE Altered beast and it doesn't have the same character upgrade stuff, but it feels stiff in the same way and has big characters and a related enemy atmosphere and I feel like someone who liked that would like this too.  I like this more.  The background is awesome! Its hard not to get hit though but you can get wolverine claws!  - play more
Castlevania (NES):  You know one thing in particular that I like about this game:  On this one level, if. you stand on a platform for longerr than you usually would (mabye 6 sec) a glowing treasure chest appears behind you near the edge of the screen.  you might never even see it if you dont know to look for it and you wouldnt normally stand there so its not everyone that is ever going to get that secret. It raises out of the ground like magic! I love that secret!  
Super Bubble Bobble (Genesis) - Well they slightly changed the notes in the fun music and gave it a less bubbly chiptune instrument so its not quite as good.   They varied up the levels which is nice so I think its a good sequel but I want to play the original tbh and wont be playing this one again.   Oh and apparently there are bosses after certain levels in this game!
SuperBoy 4 (Sega Master System) - Very Impressive!  they got the large sprites from Super Mario World on the Super Nintendo to animate and fly around on a Sega Master System!  I am impressed!  When I mean large sprites from Super Mario World I mean they literally copied them infringement style.  I dont know who made this but I know the SMS was big in South America especially into the 90s so I suspect it is from there.  If I were a kid who didnt have an NES or SNES and just had the SMS and I wanted a game like mario then I would have been pleased with this game!  Otherwise theres nothing noteworthy in the few levels I played and the jump control is workable but shitty.  I wont be playing it again.
Ninja Five-O -  AMAZING game.  I played on easy and when you beat it it says "Try normal mode.  To Be Continued..."  I dont know if "To Be Continued" means that I have to beat it on normal mode to see the real ending but I suspect that it does.  
Alien Syndrome (SMS) - This is a good version.  The story sets it as a sequel but it works exactly liek the first one did.  Not compelling enough for me right and no nostalgia so I wont play this again.
Kung Fu Kid (Sega Master System) - The "kung fu" gameplay in this is extremely shallow.  Its more interesting in Alex Kidd.  Ok thats an exaggeration but regardless the controls and moves are lifeless and uninteresting.  The enemies constantly respawn and the levels are laid out and enemy placements lead to simple encounters that while somewhat frantic are ultimately boring.  With that said the collision detection and control are just good enough that it isn't too frustrating to kick your way through hordes of enemies and if it looks like fun to you then it probably will be.  There aren't any showstopping gameplay flaws its just clumsy and relatively unpolished.  Some positives are your jump is pretty explosive and the height is kind of exciting.  The arc of the jump isnt great but the velocity is fun.  There are unfortunatley no continues so its 3 lives and thats it, but you've got a power bar so you dont lose your life instantly.
(most of the above was on 9/23 and 9/24 2018)
Zool2 (Amiga 9-28-18) - Cool game!  Slippery controls but very fast scrolling.  Stopping from a jump is tricky but you get the hang of it enough.  fortunatley they dont expect lots of pixel perfect small platform jumps in this game (at least so far).  I'm on level 3 Tooting Common.  Continue Structure:  This would be shit without the codes I found on the internet.  It gives you like 4 lives and no continues.  Codes let you get 10 or 20 lives and start from any level (3 stages per level).  I've beat level 1 with 10 lives and level 2 with 20 (but I really only used 8-10).  I've been playing 2 player which means it switches between players when you die.  one nice thing is when you get to the boss it doesn teven make you leave the room you just use up all of your lives on that one boss and his health doesn treset or anything.  Thats really nice.  Its got real quirky stuff in it like trampolines that are made of over easy eggs!?!  you jump on the yolk and it propels you way up into the air.  One other cool and quirky thing is that in each level the paths are slightly different for the two cahracters in the game.  This took me a while to figure out and I was frustrated at first because I was watching a walkthrough and Zool jumped through a ceiling wall and Zooz just couldnt do it!?!   
Turns out she can break through the ground and he can't and vice versa.  That means that theres a spot in each level where you have to break through the ceiling but if you are Zooz you have to go find the (typically nearby) spot that lets you break through the floor and go a totally different route to ultimately wind up at teh same place.  I think thats actually a completely bad ass mechanic to add a lot to replay value!
Theres no life bar which is a bit strange and it means you have to keep track of your life in your head, but thats harder because its hardly noticable when you get hit.  Fortunaley you dont get knocked back at all but theres just a little scrape sound when you get hit and you go invincible for a few seconds.  I've figured out that you get 5 hearts but thats just because I was paying a lot of attention.   You can defenitley get more hearts from enemies but I've found that its so dangerous to try to attack them taht trying to heart farm has always been a net loss!  
I got super stuck on level 3 and when I watched a longplay I saw them doing two things that werent possible for me.  One was they were constantly spin jumping.  Well I just couldn't do that and I felt like maybe I was doing something wrong.  The other was they were sliding around poles and I couldn't do that either even though in the manual it said I could by pressing over and the fire button.  Well when I experimented with keyboard mappings I found out that the spac ebar is NOT the fire button it was just working A LITTLE BIT as the fire button. The control button is ACTUALLY the fire button. Once I swapped them I can spin jump way easier, shoot faster, and easily slide around poles!  I guess the nature of the timing of the space bar was screwing all of that stuff up or something!?!  I also found out you can do some kind of parkour wall-climb flip jump wiht the new fire button!  
Ok I just beat it!  (its now Oct 1 2019 so 3 days later) Levels 3 4 and 5 arent too bad in their own ways even if they require a lot of trial and error to figure out where to go and lots of deaths along the way.  only a few of them have lots of checkpoints.  The final level is brutal. There are no checkpoints and theres a lot of work that you have to do to get to the end.  Fortunately there are several 1ups hidden around (at least 3 on that level).  I noticed an interesting side effect of playing 2 players: The levels completely respawn.  If you are playing just one player then if you break some blocks on the last level they will be broken again when you go through the level a second time.  This applies to 1 ups too!  If you play 2 players then all of the blocks get reset to their original positions every time you die.  this also means all of the 1ups are available to be picked up every time you die.  I spent probably an hour farming 1 ups to beat the level since 2 of them can usually be retrieved within 90 seconds or so.  I only noticed all this when I beat it because then it became a 1 player game again and the level stopped resetting!
Gimmick (Famicom Oct 4) - Beat it!  It was way too hard but great at the same time.  I used rewind constantly and it was tons of fun with rewind.  All of the bosses were hard but some of the bosses were amazing and some were way too hard.  Lots of cool touches as mentioned in Pats video.



Evergreen games for me:
Alex Kidd in Miracle World
Wonder Boy III The Dragons Trap
Ninja Five-O
All Mario Bros Games
Strider 2 on PSX

--------------------
James Pond II Codename Robocod (SMS) - Wow!  Content of this game aside they NAILED the technology.  I dont think there is a smoother playing platformer on the SMS!  If there is lets see it its certainly not sonic or wonderboy (nothing against those but the mechanics here are just so smooth!). The animation is lively and the scrolling is super smooth and very fast (faster and smoother than sonic on SMS See SG2).  The physics are excellent. The sense of momentum and the slide is great.  IT looks and feels like a 16bit game.  The jumps are perfectly arced and controlled.  The sprites are big, the colors are amazing the controls are perfect the sound is perfect the bouncing on enemies is near perfect the extending your torso is perfect. the platform collision detection is pixel perfect and overall the platforming in general is just fantastic.  Now I'm not even saying I'm havign as much fun as I do with Wonderboy 3.  I'm not.  This game seems to be quite shallow.  Its just incredible execution is all i'm saying.  I wish tehy had given this engine to other developers to make more interesting and varied games out of it!
This game is just a bunch of levels to explore and fiddle around in to try to find the exit all strung together with an overwoeld ccastle and all using these fun platforming mechanics.  Theres literally zero story and no sense of world building in this game which gives it an empty and shallow feeling.  I can't get into the 'shoes' or fins of this character.  The enemies and levels are really weird things that don't belong together in any way.  Candies and evil teddy bears and playing card butterflies and caterpillars, and party hats and records.  Theres no correlation and no setting in which these things would all be together as an antagonistic entity.  THe boss battles are cool but similarly disembodied like the first one is a teddy bear.  (SG1 below) Why are there spikes?  (SG1) WHy is this platform made of chocolate? 
(SG3) I've played this level 4 times now and keep getting sent back to the beginning so I must be doing something wrong!?! AHH the level design rolled me into a trick exit where I was supposed to jump on the pointy object immediately above it that looks like its going to poke my ass but is actually an elevator!
(SG4) Angel Wings! They're awesome!  I've decided the control is a slight bit too slippery for my tastes, but that doesnt take away from teh achievement of this physics engine it just means I woudl have preferred a little adjustment, or at least I THINK I would prefer it.  I wouldnt really know unless I tried it.
(SG5) The bouncey platform is great too!
THe music sucks.  It hasnt stopped the whole time and its really repetitive and not very interesting like a nursery rhyme.  
(SG6) OK there is some slowdown in parts.  This part doesnt seem like htere should be slowdown since its just some train enemies but ...  
(SG7) Second Boss is an anthropormorphic car with eyeballs and teeth.   Easy once you get the pattern down.
(SG7) The camera is not smooth when going up stairs like to teh left.  THat could be improved somewhat if I'm being picky.
(SG8)  the next level you take a bath and the bathtub floats around the screen and you pick up candy and pigs in a blanket and slugs with faces!
(SG8) Here you run around on Toothbrushes picking up dozens of rotary dial telephones!
(SG9) (Push to the left) Take that SONIC!  Blast Processing my ass!
(SG10) (push to the left) I dont like that spike pits are completely unforgiving in this game.  You fall in one and bounce and the next tiem you bounce you tak ea nother hit so a few seconds without being able to jump out and you are dead.  Fortunately you can still jump from teh floor pretty high to get out you just have ot make sure to land on something solid when you do.
(SG11) Here you get to fly an airplane!  Pretty cute and fun! 
(SG12) this is the queen of hearts boss and shes actually really tough.  Its fair enough but I wish there was a bigger hit box on her head.  it wouls still be hard.
(SG13) Jingle Bells music???
(SG14) Here while it plays chrismas music I can choose one of two exits I dont know which is best but one is less obvious and therefore possibly more 'secret' shhh
(SG15) Now I've got a car!
(SG17) The one thing that can kill you outright: THe dreaded platform!
(SG18) LArge Marge Boss!
(SG19) Final Boss!
(SG20) Ending Screens
(SG21) Here I backed up to see what happens when you lose all of your lives.  It loosk like there are only two continues.  thats dumb.  How far back does it put you though? looks like it puts you at the beginning of the stage you were on inside the stage (not outside by the door). however I found a cheat and its a cool one.  it works on genesis as well (and my guess is that it works on all the platforms!) "At the sports level, spell out the word ''lives'' by picking up these items in this order: lips, ice cream, violin, Earth, snowman."  thats the first level of the game so just do that there and you've got unlimited lives!  This guy agrees that its silly to think you could complete it without a cheat: https://youtu.be/Kqu-hosFXIM?t=1m49s
So I fiddled with the genesis version too just to see what was different.  For one thing the backgrounds were way better (as expected) with parallax scrolling for all.  They were also more detailed of course.  I have to say the sprites dont look vastly different which is surprising.  I'm sure if we looked closely we would be able to find substantial differences, but it just speaks to the quality of the SMS version that they both look really good.  Theres lots more detail in the little pickups and stuff.  The music is the same but the instruments are higher quality and in this case it sounds better as a result.  The gameplay is virtually identical.  Strangely the SMS version feels better to me but that might just be because I just got done beating it.  However one legit difference is you can't jump on things as much with the genesis version.  You have to do the down stomp or it hits you.  For example the ghosts that pop up out of pits on SMS you can kill them by jumping on them but on Genesis you cant kill them at all.
 (SG24 on SMS and SG2 on the genesis version) If you want to see the difference check out the first boss on the genesis version.  After playing the SMS then the Genesis version then going back to the SMS version the graphics distinctions are clearer but the cool thing is that they are never to the point that there is any substantial disadvantage.  Its better on the genesis without question and in every way ... its just that the gameplay is so solid and the graphics so fantastic on the SMS that the difference in quality ... well ... doesnt matter. 
----------------------
Ax Battler (Game Gear) - In the Golden Axe universe this is a cross between dragon warrior, Zelda 2, and Legendary Axe (not Golden Axe).  The combat and dungeons are 2d sidescroller fighting sections while the rest looks just like Dragon Warrior ( well better but ...).  I dont like the combat.  Its not fun.  Its pickier and harder than Zelda 2. That part isnt like Golden axe at all but if it were this would be a game for the ages!  Like if they had just mixed in parts of the actual golden axe game (edit that togethers o it looks like that) from the SMS this would have been legendary!  (SG2) In this game you actually throw a bomb at a MOUNTAIN.  And it WORKS!!!  Ok the combat isnt as bad once you get the high jump in the city since I have retreat options now.  But its still bad when you get to the peninsula tower.  There are a bunch of enemies which are really difficult even with REWIND!  Also its one of those games like when you get the crystal you dont know what to do with it.  This chicken leg told me to get it but I didnt know I was supposed to bring it back to HIM!?! When i use it I go on the back of the turtle (SG5) and the combat here like in the cave is frustrating because the camera doesnt let you see whats coming up so you get hit all the time by enemies coming in from the right.  Here you can kill dragons with one hit even though skeletons took 4 and were really brutal to you.  In a desert you encounter more chicken legs and they can apparently (SG7) whip you from 4 of their body lengths away!?!  I really like how you train to get new powers.  (load SG8 and then show off the upswing and the high jump and the jump swing and the new one which is super swing)  
So I already beat this pyramid in the desert but I didnt get anythign from it.  Turns out youre supposed to jump OVER the pyramid and then you get a key!?! WTF!?!  How would I have known to do that.  The path the game is leading me down goes THROUGH the pyramid.  Its a secret room at the top and critical items should never be secrets!?!  If this was a long game I wouldn't play anymore but its apparently pretty short and I'm like halfway through (which is how I LIKE games like this) so I think I will continue.
 (SG11) The random battles are way too common
 (SG12) Chapter 7 https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gamegear/586640-ax-battler-a-legend-of-golden-axe/faqs/10373
 	Just got the compass and the tackle power (Show the tackle power)
 (SG14) Chapter 8
 (SG15) Chapter 8 Mountain
 (SG16) Glitch! I got stuck in a mountain!  Duck and im safe!
 (SG17) About to be picked up by an eagle!  Also the music here is exactly like Zelda 2 Castle Music
 (SG18) Chapter 9 
 (SG19) Just got the downward thrust
 (SG20) here you get a magic stone in a swap square when you search.  There was NO CLUE telling you to do that, just that a guy lost his magic stone.  Its just from the level design and that square sticking out a bit visually that you would even know that was worth searching in.  
 (SG21) Chapter 10
 (SG23) Shitty Arrow part.  THen "Where do I go now?  Oh a random floating loofah flies down to fetch me?  Right.  What the fuck?  HOw do I avoid these arrows?  Fuck.  Now I made it to the top now what?  Oh sure a random mirror appears out of the floor?  Right!"
 (SG24) Here I'm stuck at the end of the game.  Theres no where to go!!!  I looked everywhere for one of the damn mirrors.  It turns out its on this platform.  Not here on the platform.  Not in the center of the platofrm but if you stand on the right side of the platform (of course) and then ride it all the way to the top ...  DAMN!  and ... theres no final boss!  Thats good because I was almost dead!  but finally the deed is done!!

Amagon (NES) - 
Zone 1-1: I remember this so fondly from rentals as a kid.  
I guess it was the box and something about the fantasy of the skinny boy becoming really strong and powerful that I loved (Show cover art).  I remember renting it and spending hours with it and not getting very far and feeling like a failure.  Only now in hindsight do I know that is because it was a shitty game and it was not my fault.  I am not a failure!  (I'm just saying that to make myself feel better!).  The graphics are pretty shitty even for an NES game.  Mostly that is.  
Level 1:
(SG28) Your characters sprite isnt bad (even if hes cartoony) and its cute how he ducks and becomes a little flat ball of flesh or like coils up like a snake or something!  
(SG25) Whats actually beautiful for an NES game is the reflections on the water. Thats amazing!  Theres no fancy scrolling or anything so the backgrounds just look cheap to me.  
(SG26) The mountain isnt too bad but its not colorful.  
(SG27) There arent many colors though adn theres a lack of shading on some mountains but not others.  There is shading on the rocks and trees and the top of the grass.  
(SG29) I also like how he jumps by pulling his knees up under his chin!  

Ok now THATS the powerup or as its known in the manual the Mega-key.  I remember in 1990 getting the powerup in the game and not knowing what to do with it to activate it!  That was always frustrating to me.   I did eventually figure out back then how to activate the powerup because at first when you rented the NES game it came with the manual in the little clear case.  It is easy in hindsight (its just pressing select) but I do remember for a long time thinking I was doing something wrong and thinking I needed to do something else ot powerup.  I couldn't fathom that it wouldnt activate automatically at first.   
Oh and now he has a life bar!  
I like how his uppercut takes out any enemy!  
Its funny how his face scrunches down when hes Megagon!  

Points and life
(SG32) If you activate the Mega-Key with just a small number of points you only get a small amount of life.  5000 is the minimum and 70000 is the max but to get 70000 you usually have to have to gone through some enemies and died and gone through them again.  Typically on level one you will collect about 20000 points and which gets you about this much life which is plenty to make it to and through the boss as long as you spam the uppercut button :)

How about a little background here
  Hey look in the first screen of the game you can see your escape ship!


When the level is complete and your guy looks at you he looks ... mildly satisfied with his triumphant victory over the deadly werewolf beast! 
(SG31) Level 2: Fuck those bees!  You cant hit those tiny things with that shitty gun and this control.  The control isnt bad but it isnt contra either.  Ok theres a part on level 2 where there are two tree platforms and a grass platform in the middle all on the water.  Theres a mushroom in the middle and there is NO WAY you could figure out what to do the first time through.  You have to jump onto the platform just right (controls arent perfect remember) and then jump BACK on to the tree because even if you jump  on to the platform just right he tears off and jumps back and forth and doesnt stay on his own side of the bed but jumps onto your side too!  In the next part birds are attacking like a barrage of bullets adn you have to creep forward very slowly to be able to aim and hit them.  Also the jumping parts when there are birds coming at you at every level suck.  Ok the bosses are ok because as long as you come in with more than 3 health you can take them out by spamming your uppercut.  Lets see what happens if I die?     Continues please???  Wait what is this on level 3?   An elephant man with man-boobs???  Ok wait theres something fucked up here.  Theres limited ammo per level.  Thats ok as far as it goes (stupid but whatever) but I started level 3 with only 14 bullets!  I emptied thim into this elephant fatass and that didn ttake him out so then it just goes to this weakling trying to beat your enemies with his empty rifle!  So two problems: One: Limited ammo Two: Limited ammo for the WHOLE GAME?  It doesnt reload your ammo at the beginning of the stage?  I dont get more ammo from the enemies I am killing?  What is going on!?!  Elephant man comes at you relentlessly and you can jump over him ok but then when he turns around he RUNS RELALY FAST!  Fortunately theres nothing you can accidentally bump into right?  NOO BEES!!!!  NO AMMO!!! SHIT!!!  Also remember.  One hit kills with this weakling.  Funny: When he runs out of ammo his posture is epic!  Thats one hell of a case of anterior pelvic tilt!  Hes on his tippytoes!!!      For added fun the elephant man lays eggs, and they are not formed in his uterus they are formed in the region of his head and he squirts them out of his elephant trunk right at your face at high velocity when you least expect it.  THey are eggs of death so they will kill you if they touch you so if anterior pelvic tilt boy is trying to get up close enough to hit him with the butt of his rifle you'd better pray youve timed your attack between the trunk based eggsplosion or you're DEAD MEAT!  NO CONTINUES!?!  Ok I learned that once you beat level 4 there will be a level select option. I wish I had known this when I was a kid because I would have been more motivated to struggle through to that level.  I'm quite sure I never even beat level 2 as a kid though so that would have been very tough and possibly impossible for my childhood non upgraded nintendo hands.  So on level 3 if you can shoot the elephant man enough you get the powerup to amagon.  Now I only have like 4 life ... why?  Does this carryover from last time too?  Is it related to my score at the time?  How do you increase your life?  After a while I have to jump on the back of a monochrome depressed turtle with a constant flame coming out of its asshole like a pilot light.  This jet ass-engine apparently gives him the capability to hover in mid air.  Does he have F-35 style thrust vectoring in his asshole?  WIth the not too precise jumping and the tutrles shell not providing a very stable platform to land on and with the spiders falling and bees shooting projectiles it seems virtually impossible to me for someone to beat this section without taking hits.  At the end of level 3 (probably level 2-2) right when its a bout to send me into a boss battle, it chickens out and makes me small and sends me to the next level.  Why?  Couldn't come up with another boss sprite?  It even plays the exciting boss battle music!  Well its acually good because I only had 2-3 life left at the time.  I think its cool how his uppercut can kill things even down by his feet like he crouches to the ground and back up in less than a frame of animation so we cant even see it!   Part way through level 4 there is a Crocodile man or Dinosaur or some shit.  They are like the fat elephant man and they take 15 shots from your gun.  THey shoot snot bubbles at you so you have to duck to hit them. Well this is the first time I've seen these guys and they dont put you on a platofrm with a lot of room so its relaly hard to get past this part.  Land on platform, see new guy, wonder what he does, try to dodge snot bubble, shoot once which should take him down.  What it doesnt?  Shoot many more times!  Oh oh that took too long.  Die and try again (remember one hit kills).  Well next time you get there you know what to do.  Duck and shoot like mad.  ANd that works, except hes got backup.  Thats right its the first time youve ever seen this guy and there are TWO of them!?!  THeres BARELY enough time if you know they are there and start shooting before they actually get on screen to kill them both.  
 (11:08:02) A little later theres one in the water down at the bottom of the screen.  Hes just tooting along and you figure that hes too low so he will not be a threat atm.  Well if you dont go EXtREMELEY carefully you will die because he jumps so quick and remember one hit kills?  Even if you are super careful he jumps onto the platform and by that point you have very little space to retreat so if you can super quickly run to the left, turn around, duck, and shoot like mad then you MIGHT be able to take him out just before he hits you as hes creeping near on his crocodile man-legs.   If you let him come to you you stand a better chance of beating him.
  (11:18:39) At the end of level 3-1 (which I've mistakenly been calling level 4) The boss battle is so bad ass.  There are two of those crocodile men.  reasonalby spaced out.  Lots of room to jump their projectiles.  They dont attack at once.  Wait did I say bad ass?  Its shit.  Its far easier than the other three encounters with the crocodile men earlier in the level.  
  (11:26:37) At least zone 3-2 gives you a useful tip. Get as many bullets as possible.  You're telling me that now?  That would have been a good tip for the beginning of the game!?! Instead what about at the beginning of the game:  No Bullet Refills: Collect as many as possible. 
  (11:32:54) This is the final Hippo Boss for stage 3.  Its not hard and I think its actually pretty cool but the hard part is just getting to this boss.  Just imagine tryiing to make it through these 6 levels without dying 3-4 times!?!  And then getting to this boss because theres so much platform jumping here that its not too hard to not get hit by the boss but accidentally jumping into the pond and dying thats EASY.
  (11:36:15) Imagine getting to zone 4 without dying.  According to the codes I read about thats your safe zone becasue you can now continue!  Whew. I've only got one life left so that makes me feel better.  Continue. Hell yeah!  Continue from Zone 4!!! 
  Wait why does it say zone 2?  none of the arrow keys change the selection!?! Oh wait maybe it sthe select button?  Whew!  Ok zone 3 and zone 4 .. wait ... what ... (cycles through) no zone 4???  I have to start at the beginning of zone 3!?! What the actual fuck!?!  So when i read the code again it says if you get to zone 4 then you will get a continue screen and can continue at the beginning of any zones you've already beaten.  not at the end of them?  Not where i left off?  What kind of continue is that!?! You know what theres something worse.  Watch this.  (selects zone 3). (dies 4 times).  Game OVer?  No Continue? So this just pissed me off and the shit of it is that once you get to level 4 you unlock the continue feature which only lets you continue from stages you have beaten, but theres a catch!  if you die on any of the stages prior to level 4 its game fucking over.  Game over!  So I've been trying all this time to get to level 4 to unlock the continue feature thinking I wouldnt have to go back to the earlier levels again but you do.  Basically it just helps a little.  You have to get to level 4 with no continues and when you do you have to then beat three AND four and make sure you beat three with no continues.  Then once you've beat 4 hopefully you can level select form there on properly.  GEEZ!!!
  (11:48:47) Watdch out for "skelton" monster?
  (11:53:07) Beat level 4 onto level 5 something about clouds???  Look at this I'm jus trealizing how strange the jump is: If you let up on the button he drops liek a rock!  But ok on this level I should be able to continue if I die right?? WRONG!  You always have to start out one level early and beat through that level and the next.  There are only 6 zones total.  So you have to get through the first half of the entire game on one continue then from then on you have to get through one third of the game on one continue to progress and oh I dont know if I made this clear.  If you get to level 4 and you die then as we talked about you have to start on level 3 and you have one continue to beat level 4 or you have to start back on level 3 again, but whats MUCH WORSE is if you use your continue on level 3 beofre you even get to level 4, even after youve been to level 4 before you are GAME OVER.  In some sense that means its the hardest stupidest part of the game.  
  (12:22:34) Zone 6-1. on this shitty level they introduce aliens, crabs are humping the trees, and you dont get amagon until the final screen of the boss fight!?!  what the fuck?
  (12:28:10) Zone 6-2 Final Level!!!
  (12:32:23) Final Boss! then you get some quick cutscene showing an escape from the idsland and some pretty good tunes and "You survived your mission  The end ..."
  Lets go back and see if I can beat each zone with just one continue with no cheats.
  (12:39:30) Starting Zone 1 - Good news: There are at least invisible checkpoints!  Ok Didnt make it on my first try.  It took me about 10 minutes to beat the whole first level (1-1) once.  But to beat the whole first level consistently enough that I could get to the second level with enough lives and then beat the whole second level (1-2) in one go well I never did it!  I spent 45 minutes attempting it.  I was really fed up after 30 minutes.  Now I know that logically and statistically I could do it.  If I stopped now my brain would take in some of what I learned today and tomorrow I would be better at both levels.  If I did that every day I could get through level 1-2 in a few days I believe and at that point what would I have achieved?  A great triumph?  well sort of yeah.  But not really because I'm not even close to being done.  I have to get through zone 2 and zone 3 before I even have a chance to continue.  That means I need to get through zones 1-1 and 1-2 so consistently that I can do them perfect every time because Imma need my lives on zones 2 and 3 and really I'm going to have to do the same thing of getting consistently good on zone 2 because I remember zone 3 being a bitch.    Meanwhile I cant play zone 2 unless I beat zone 1 every single game so getting practice on zone 2 is exponentially harder to get than zone 1.  This is not FUN guys its NOT FUN!!!  The game is fun one level at a time.  If there were continues by zone I would say this is a pretty good fun game if simple and a bit rough around the edges, but it has some fun gameplay at its core, but in its untouched state I can't say this is a fun game!  In the 45 minutes I 
  died dozens of times, 
  Got game over onlevel 1-1 9 times
  times
  Fought the level 1 boss 13
  times
  reached level 1-2 4
  times
  Got game over on level 1-2 4
  time
  At one point in my game I started getting lots of one up pickups!?!  I wonder why???
  
  THen I decided to cheat and practice level 1-2 to get good at it first.  When I did I figured out some fucked up shit.  You really can't afford to die because your ammo doesnt reset even after death.  It doesnt start you at the checkpoint with the ammo you had at that checkpoint.  it starts you with the ammo you had when you died.  This means if you blow through an area using ammo and die you will never get that ammo back.  you can't afford to be low on ammo when you get to the second zone so if you die after the wrong area (any heavy ammo use area) you are fucked.  Finally after trying it dozens of times for 20 minutes straight my brain is burned out and I give up.  It feels futile and although I'm sure there are people out there who have done it and although I'm sure that better players than me could do it with less trouble, the continue structure of this game makes it a beating and steals the fun away from what otherwise would be a cool little game and somewhat of a simple classic that people woudl com eback to from time to time.  As it is if you were lucky/unlucky ennough to play this back in the day then you either quickly dismissed it for what it is (unfair and not fun enough to overcome the unfairness) or you like me didnt know any better and thought you just sucked at it.  Well Im glad to shed light on the reality of it for all of you and for the child in me who is relieved to know that it wasnt just that little guys fault.  it just sucked!
  
  Update: What if I tried to beat it with the infinite lives game genie code?  That might be the right balance between the lopsided replay/continue-based-difficulty and making it too easy with like invincibility or something.   Clearly since they thought of adding a continue at level four they did TRY to get their continue structure balanced and thats what they wanted, they just royally fucked it up!  Then if I die I go back to the designated checkpoint but I don't ever have to start the whole game over again!  I just have to beat every checkpoint section of the game legitimately without rewind.  This sounds like a fun challenge and one which I would like to try.  I have a feeling there will be some levels in the middle that have such stupid enemy arrangements that it is going to be extremely difficult even with unlimited lives but its worth a shot!
--------------------------------
Risky Woods (Genesis) - I wish I had bought this for the Amiga back in the day because I knew a lot about this and wanted it but never ended up really going for it and if I had paid full price for it I would have valued it even more and its a fair enough game I would have had tons of fun with it!  then again I bet the controls werent as good with up to jump on the Amiga.  sad face.  I bet the Amiga music is better but this version is great.  The graphics are awesome and the gameplay is cool. I fucking love the boomerang!  The boomerang is one of the best weapons in any game ever made! I like the level progression which has you collect things and then play a simple simon game to pass a gate.  I finished level one but it said I didnt save all of the souls and started me over.  Turns out I had to break another statue like the one at the end that Elvis comes out of and then flies into the heavens.  It kind of blended into the background the first time through and was on an apparently alternate path.  You keep your weapons when you die and start in the same place you died!  You die a lot from things that dont make sense like things in a treasure chest.  Also its weird that you have to duck to pick up items (even coins!?!).  It doesnt restore your life when you beat a stage!?!  Does it let you continue from that stage?  Theres a weapon on level 2 that it wont even let you get!?!  you beat the simon game and it throws the weapon onto a windowsill which you cant jump up to at all!  I want to see what that weapon is like but I cant at this point.  Thats ok I have the boomerang!  Hes weaaring like a toga or something!?!   Sometimes the apples poison you adn sometimes they give you points.  Why do the powerups and pickups kill you?  The boomerang sucks for getting enemies that are about to jump up stairs to you or are flying just beneath you.  One of the powerups warps you back to the beginning of the level!?!  TH scrolling is great.  Update: Its fatal flaw is revealed.  Its really tough and there are no continues.  Update: If you use EOA for your high score name you can do level select!  The Amiga version looks a bit choppier actually.  The guy looks way more bad ass though.  Sometimes the Elvis statues are decoys that just flame on and burn your little tiny feetsies!  Whoa in the Amiga version tehre is a shop between levels! Oh I see that was replaced by the simon game and the getting weapons from the eye key.  Whenever you go indoors it uses a cool technique to make it seem darker than when it was outside.  But its too dark to see whats going on!?!  The sickle and flame circle are awesome weapons as well!  I'm pretty sure on this cave boss theres no physical way to beat him without getting hit.  I think for a game with limited continues thats cheap and not good game design.  I figured out a trick with the boomerang for the boss in the cave: Shoot backwards!  You never get hit!  well ... WHAT?  To beat the cave level you commit hari-kari???? My heart will go on ... OMG on the Amiga verison (in fact every version but the genesis afaik) theres no way to continue!?!  WTF.  Never mind I am so gald I did not buy this back then It would have been super fun for an hour or two but then ultimately made me feel like really bad at computer games.  I'm pretty sure the one up in the chest is a little motherfucker that can't be got!  What/. Falling down pits doesnt kill you it just takes some life away? I guess thats fair but doesnt make much sense and doesnt help much if there are no continues!?!  Nope on level 4 theres literally no way to tell the two statues apart!  THe axe weapon is awesome!  unless you want to get coins out of a purse that is right in front of you!?!  If its not in front ofyou then they will disappear before you collect them!?!  THe spikey cephalopod bats on level 4 are cheap as hell.  Almost as cheap as the shitty fireball demons on level 1.  Beginning of level 5 is a good example.   There is apparently a minimum hit distance that if the enemy is closer than that you cant hit them so If they get up in your face you cant hit them and they just hit you over and over and just slightly bounce off of you so close they can hit you again quickly but not far enough that you either a. have a chance to escape or b. can hit them from that short distance.  
Shit there are time outs in this game too!?!  Ok there are two continues.  THats not nearly enough!?!  Update: Good news I found a cheat on the Amiga.  If you type 'rip' then you can push f1 for more money f2 for more life and f3 for level skip!  Now I take it back and with that information I would have fucking LOVED this game as a kid!  OTOH I don't know how I would have obtained that information.  I just imagine spending $40 or $50 for this game waiting a week for it to get shipped to my local computer store (Where I bought games) playing it for a few hours.  Getting extremely frustrated.  And giving up.  I would have then later thought: Hmm maybe there is a way to get more continues or something.  But where would I look?  scour my old amiga magazines.  Yeah I would have done that but it would have been dumb luck if I had happened to find the amiga magazine that published that code! And amiga magazines werent like NP with a secrets section in every issue.  I would have more chance of figuring out the code myself! Well ok thats not true but ... what else would I have done?  I wouldn't know for sure there was a code and I would probably ask lots of people adn they would say "well I dont know of one." and then someone would say "yeah I don tthink theres a code for that game.  sorry" and I would believe them and give up. Then 25 years later I would be playing this game in 2018 and fin dthe code on the internet and say FUUUCKKK!!!  When you do this cheat on the genesis and then select your level in the options menu when you use it you actually play as a different characgter with a face helmet and hairy limbs!  I think its an ape man but they don't want to tell you that!  Hes also semi-invincible which is a nice bonus feature!  I say semi because at one point he degraded back to the old character and I was losing health again.  One thing I like is that when you get to the key and if you don thave part of the key it transports you right back to where the key was!  This happens on level 4 at least.  That means they really thought of a lot of things (even if they didnt give enough damn continues!?!). Alright! Stage 4 complete!  Stage 5 is pretty fucked up since I think the only way to get the first key eye is to get to the door adn take damage to have it transport you back!?!  wtf!?!  Also when you are standing on platforms on stage 5 after the second door the dudes can just jump a little bit from the bottom platform and you take a hit!   Thats from dudes where there is literally no way to hit them naturally!  Stage 5 completed!  Ugh!?! Stage 6 boss is stupid.    Even with my boomerang trick I don't think there could possibly be a way to beat that guy without losing several lives in the process!?! I wonder if one of the other weapons would be powerful against him megaman-style???  Stage 7 music is fine but its so happy!?! Its totally incongruous with the death and destruction and golden demonic-lizard statues and bloodstains on the walls!   It would fit in pretty well in Donkey Kong Country (insert some DKC footage with that soundtrack)   The third lock on stage seven sends half of your weapon options into the pit and I dont think they ever playtested that!  When you go a little too far to the right it locks you off from going left again.  This means the only way to go back to get the key-eyes is when you get to the lock and it teleports you back (and takes half your health!?!). Also on stage 8 the first statue you see is on an upper deck but you dont know that until you've gone too far to get back to the platform that gets you to the upper deck!?!  I think they designed it in this way! I know this because when I get to the first lock i dont have all of the key-eyes so it teleports me back to a key-eye that wasnt there before!?!  I lost life when they did that!?! only then can I get to the statue again.   There is DEFINITELY no way to kill the statues without getting hit.    Oh and throughout there is a time limit to make sure that if you have any trouble durin gthe level with any of teh puzzles or enemies that you will die and it iwll be by definition far along in the level and probably right before you get to the end of the level and be taken all the way back to the beginning of the level with all of your level progress cleared out.  fuck.  It doesnt do this to you if you die once or twice but only if you run out of time.  Stage 8 is a good example of an easy place to run out of time.  And whats this bullshit on level 8 when there are TWO of the statues double teaming you!?!  Its not like in some of the classic platformers where they put these beasties on levels in certain places so you would ahve to figure out a good strategy to get through it unharmed or minimally harmed.  In those games (castlevania was pretty good about this) if you're really skilled and experienced you can get through it unharmed, but if you're not you'll take your licks before you find a strategy and attack that gest you through.  In this part of this game theres no strategy that could possibly hit these guys.    no one of any skill would be able to get through this unscathed.  Thats shit. Near the end of stage 8 theres a statue which you have to destroy.  not because it has an elvis (thank you very much) in it oh no!  Because it has a key-eye in it but that means since it doesnt have an elvis in it it will damage you.  SO to beat this level you HAVE to have that much damage available.  bullshit.  There are definitely some ghosts and goblins similarities with this game.  Stage 9 boss is slightly more fair since if you make a pixel perfect jump you can jum pthe fireballs at least.  What? His head dies but his body is till moving like a chicken with it shead cut off!?!   This game violates a fundamental rule of good game design: Make the players death their fault.  If they can't avoid taking damage or dying no matter what its not their fault and it takes the senese of control away from the player, like they are not in control of thier own fate.  It makes you feel powerless and thats not what games are about!?! THeyare about feeling like a bad ass hwen you beat a level because you made the righ tjumps and attacks to minimize damagae and survive and sometime syou do it relaly well and feel like a super bad ass!  Not in this game.  Surviving is tough enough but theres no opportunity for real improvement.  No way to get so good you dont get hit.  Nothing really to strive for.  No reason to get way better at it, and given the limited continues and forced damage taking its not a fun challenge to try to get good enough to beat it with "skill" its not FUN!  Not to mention its fucking unfair and frustrating.  After the first key on stage 10 theres a platform that legitimately looks like it doesnt exist.  I was waiting for a moving platform to come and retrieve me but no... you need to do a leap of faith into the void.  Stage 10 complete (by the seat of my pants due to time limit). Stage 11 is just FULL of shit you cant avoid.  Constant demon bats flying at you from every direction while you try to kill those statues.  ARRGH!  Stage 11 Completed!  Based on the map area that I can see level 12 is the final boss and it had better be because this guy is a bitch!  Theres virtually no way to dodge his projectiles, you dont get to select your weapon so if you just beat level 11 then you will have fewer lives but if you just continued to here you'll just have the kknife.  And his life goes down SO SLOW!!!  and whats worse even if you find a strategy that seems to be taking down his life ... you've got a time limit.  And its only TWO MINUTES!!?!?!  I candefintely report that the knife works well on this guy.  Certainly better than the sickle (which doesnt really make sense but whatever!?!). or maybe its just because I still have the faceplate and I didnt when I had the sickle last time ... who knows!?!  OK I BEAT IT!!  theres no text just your guy on a mountain raising his staff over and over.  Thats pretty cool though.    Ok now I was playing wtih tthe optiosn and realied I can select any level I want PAST 12. That scared me because I was afraid there were going to be many more levels that you are supposed to get through without any continues ACK!  Well lets see what level 13 is!  Oh cool!  its the end screen where hes raisng his staff!  Ok whats 14 then?  Oh its the same.  It goes all the way up to 34 and I presume they are all the same!  (test this to be really thorough).  Well thats it for Risky Woods.  Some little problems and two big ones: Forced Damage and No Unlimited Continues.  Still I actually had a lot of fun playing and beating it the way I did and finding all of these gems to point out to you.  I hope you liked this and I hope you learned something about good and shitty game design in the process!  Party On!

# Late 2019 Games #
* Xenocrisis - I bought this full price because it looked so damn cool.  I presumed the continue structure would be modern and not 1992 broken but I was (mostly) wrong.  5 lives on easy mode 3 continues and thats it.  I got through the first dungeon and the second and beat both bosses and its really damn cool, but its like SmashTV and not the arcade version but the home version with inexplicable and unfair limited continues.  I'm a bit mad about this and might play it again tomorrow but will probably return it unless I look through the manual and find a reasonable official easy way to continue from the level I stopped on.   Update 30min later: I've dug through the discussions and found out that I was right the continue structure is pretty broken. In fact in some ways its worse than I thought: There are only 3 continues, but if you beat the game using 2 or 3 continues you get to the end and ... game over.  No final boss.  no ending screens or story or celebration.  Just death.  I think thats shit.  In fact if you use even a single continue you get that same result.  This was deliberate on the part of the dev and hes had to defend it from a number of people who think the game is too hard like me.  I just dont know about this.  Its really really good but I am not in the mood for another brutal game right now.  I believe I could eventually beat levels 1 and 2 on easy on one continue eventually but there are 7 fucking levels.  Ok at least they did provide a cheat menu where you can specify the seed for the procedural rooms and also unlimited health, and or continues and you can pick your starting level.  Here are some of the discussions I took part in: 
	* HirmHund: The brutal 1cc requirement of Xeno Crisis is a design flaw. What good is your final boss if 99% of players will never see it outside of youtube?   Xenoleinzer: I agree with this. It's normal to reward skilled players but in this case I have the impression that most of the players are punished with a game over ending despite their efforts to finish it with 3 credits.  Me: Agreed. I want to be able to experience the game you've created for us, see the artwork and graphics, blast the enemies, figure out the boss patterns, and have fun and re-live some of the experience of the 90s games that I loved but without the frustration and feelings of defeat I often had back then. My free time is precious to me so its not so much fun for me to spend significant time building up my skills or feeling frustrated and repeating the early levels of games over and over to get one level closer to the end and have to start over again and again. I have a lot of fun trying a single thing a thousand times until I get good at it and beat it, but its discouraging and disheartening for me to have to go back to the beginning. I'm going to try the cheat mode to simulate this experience and I hope it works.  Meanwhile an alternative that might be more satisfactory for a lot of us less hardcore players is if you get to the end under any circumstances, then you get a simple picture and one screen ending that celebrates your win with something like this: "Congratulations! You have defeated the hordes of darkness (use canon words here of course). Unfortunately the boss escaped and will be back another day to scourge the galaxy with a new horde of evil minions. Try again with fewer continues to capture the boss and save the galaxy once and for all". Don't give them the full ending or the final boss, but don't dump them in the gutter with a game over. This would still achieve your design choice of significantly rewarding players who beat it with <1 continue but would not punish or insult players who have invested their precious time and money into the game but don't have the time to invest in getting so much better.
	* Originally posted by Bitmap Bureau: too many games of the 80s / 90s era allowed you to credit feed, Me: My memory of genesis games in the 80s / 90s was different. I honestly wish I had been able to play more Genesis games which let me credit feed because there are dozens of games I never got to see much of because I was never good enough to get very far at all.  Which games are you referring too when you say 'too many'?  P.S. I don't mean to be hard on you I honestly want to know and actually understand where you are coming from: the hardcore retro game difficulty (I remember it well .. too well) and respect it even if I don't like it (and will am considering returning the game because of it)
	* Update 30min later: So I used the unlimited ammo cheat and with just that I was able to beat the 3rd level with 0 continues.  I'm really proud of myself.  I am starting to see what the dev means and its not so bad anymore.  HOWEVER: If I hadn't dug through the discussions and found how to get to the seed and cheats menu I would feel ripped off annoyed angry and insulted.  Update: Nest Cleared no continues used!  Although: I only had one life left though.  
	* Update 30min later:  So admittedly I've had some gin and typing is hard, but I'm on the forest level and its much more difficult than the last.  I haven't been able to beat it on one continue and I've tried 5 times now.  Its a really fun game though so its ok.  I've revised my feelings about it somewhat, but it could have been clearer about its intentions with me and my feelings.  It could have announced that it was going to fuck with my feelings and make me feel not so powerful.  I'm playing with inifinite ammo and I dont honestly see how I could beat it with finite ammo regardless of continues.  Ok I finally beat it using 3 continues
	* Already played it for 100 minutes so I'm almost up to the 2h limit for returns.  I dont think I'll return it since its been decent fun so far, but its so close to wonderfulness that its sad.  I don't know if I'll ever beat it unless I just use unlimited continues.  I don't think I'll ever see the final boss. :( 
	* Next day.  I tried the genesis version and its no better.  On emulators you can save state which would seem like that would fix it but no it really doesn't because beating the first boss without using any continues is incredibly difficult and in this one there are no options for unlimited continues so I just spent 20 min trying to beat that one boss without using a continue to no avail.  
* Warhammer: Vermintide 2 - The combat is amazing!  I had a ton of fun adventuring to escape some skaven base.  The amount of backstory and canon in this game and in their universe is staggering. This is a lot of fun. I think its on sale?    Update: Played it at Trey's LAN Party and it was a complete blast!
* Lego Jurassic World - Wow the PC controls are broken as hell.  It is a chore and nightmare to move the players around.  It is advertised in the manual that you can use keyboard and mouse but no it wont let you use the mouse at all even to select menu items.  Its absurd.  Further in the process of trying to switch to gamepad I activated the second player and couldnt deactivate.  Further and the nail in the coffin is the saves are way too far apart and this was something I remember from some of the other games too.  
* Red Faction 2 -  5.1hrs on record in Steam. Short and sweet just how I like it.   Heres the review I posted on Steam in its entirety: "This is a great game and I had a blast playing it in 2019.  To address the mixed reviews I think I understand what is going on here. When you hold this title up against its predecessor there are some things missing from this title which I think warrant some peoples complaints namely: there's not much of the game that is destructible which is sorely missed since it was such a huge aspect of the first game, and its shorter than the first game (it was a perfect length imho but to each his own). Those are valid complaints when you compare it with the first game and I guess I just wish they had named it something other than Red Faction because when you look at the game without comparing it to its predecessor its great! What you get in place of those aspects that are missing is a more exciting action packed game with more interesting NPCs, great voice acting (the great actor Jason Statham voices one of the characters!), excellent vehicle levels to add variety and interesting boss fights. The story had twists and turns which kept it interesting all the way through. This whole game was cinematic. The gunplay is excellent. All of the weapons feel appropriately powerful and make a big impact which makes the basic shooting in the game (which is the core of the gameplay) feel fantastic. Its a joy to play and I had a blast. I played it in 4k with max settings and it looked better than I expected it to tbh." 
* Red Faction 1 - Well I played about half way through but theres a game breaking bug!  You can't enter the submarine at all.  It falls and crashes because the overhead release is on a frame count timer not a real time timer.  Apparently the open source Red Faction engine can play it and would let me finish.  I think I would like to because it was so good bitd and I had so much fun playing the first few hours.  
* Gauntlet Slayer Edition 12/18/19 - I beat this today!  I first played it a few months ago and it took me a while to get into but once I figured out the elf and the controls I've been having lots of fun.  I beat it on Easy.  Continue structure is perfect.  You can replay any level and you have to unlock the next levels by beating one of the current levels.  When you die you have to wait a few seconds and then you can respawn in exactly the same location (at least on easy mode) the elf is a dual stick shooter and I had a blast. 
* Hellbound Demo - 12/18/19 - I've played for 53 minutes and in my last game I beat it in 16 minutes (par was <2 but thats ok) and I loved it.  Its the same formula as doom but with updated graphics and shooting that are wonderful and with a really interesting map.  Interesting to me in the perfect way: finding keys finding the best way to come at the enemies to get the drop on them and not have them overwhelm you and unlocking doors to find the exit.  I loved it.  
* Project Warlock Arctic Attack - 12/18/19 - I liked this ok but I feel like I am supposed to like it more.  I loved the great retro look and feel.  it felt big and scary and intense and interesting, but having just played hellbound I dont know ...I'm not done and plan to play it some more and wouldn't be ashamed to buy the full version.
* Out Run 3D 3DS - 12/26/19 - This is really good. the controls are great and well mapped and I dont feel cheated by them.  I think I'm doing something wrong though because I am not making any big mistakes and still can't beat the second leg.  I get close every time.  I'll keep trying.  The 3d is fantastic.  I can't tell whether the continue structure is good here because it seems like you can select your leg but I don't see that working unfortunatley so that may just be for fastest times on that leg.  This is really cool.  You can change the settings to make it pretty easy.  Now I can just tap the brakes and beat it in a few minutes with ending A
  - I love the 3D and smooth sprite scaling and cool environments.  This is one of the best racing games ever.  
  - Splash wave!
  - It seems to have an upgrade system of some sort which compels you to play it and beat it even at the easier levels
  - Today 3-5-2020 I beat it on Two star difficulty and got the second ending where the car falls apart 
* Space Harrier 3D 3DS - 12/27/19 - This is really good. The controls are great with the pad or the dpad, but also there are touch controls which use the stylus which I think would work really well possibly better than the mouse on the Amiga port.  The graphics are arcade perfect and better than any port including Amiga.  The sound and music is great, and theres a level select when you unlock them!  Thats awesome!  That fixes the continue structure.  You only get 3 lives per level but thats ok thats a fair challenge (at least at this point on these earlier levels - could be a problem later but I dont know).  And the 3d is fantastic! 2-28-2020  - Not only is the 3D fantastic but the quality of life features are top notch.  Adjustable lives and difficulty, level select, save and load, replay save, saved high scores.  It’s really great!
  - It’s also got music playback in the menus which is great because the music is great

# 2020 Games #
* Mickey Mouse Land of Illusion Game Gear 1/8/2020 - I got to the second or third level, its cool that theres an overworld map and its got a good continue structure with apparently unlimited continues.  On tihs level theres a bunch of clunky underwater controls and its prety unforgiving and makes it not too much fun.  I was hopingto have more fun with it and its not too hard and I know I could beat it I'm just not motivated.  I think it would have been great bitd.  
* Devilish GG 1/8/2020 - This is a weird game with breakout controls.  I dont like it but I did have a game on DS called Class Action Devilish I think and I made some decent progress in that one.
* Double Dragon GG 1/8/2020 - Well this is so weird, its nothing like any of the other versions you can move up and down but its real clunky and its sort of more like a side scrolling platformer.  Its weird and not that fun but it might have been plenty of fun bitd.
* Double Dragon SMS 1/8/2020 - I remember wanting this when one of my friends was over and I asked my dad to go get it for us so we could play it on a sleepover and he did and it was super fun.  I think we beat it or got to the end and had a blast.  The graphics are shiny and clear and really discrete.  It looks great.  
* Power Strike SMS 1/8/2020 - Its pretty fancy with all of the 8 way controls and stuff.  I didnt love it though.  
* Sonic SMS 1/8/2020 - The graphics are great and theres an overworld which is pretty cool.  I would have loved this if I had bought it although I would have continued to be jealous of the genesis version.  The graphics are great.  the enemy sprites are small but everything is clear and the shading is great like the trees and grass hanging over the edge.  The controls actually feel fantastic. Maybe better than the Genesis.  it looks like you get the chaos emeralds by finding them hidden in teh levels.  The continue structure kind of sucks though.  On interesting quirk is you can't collect your rings when you get hit. One thing that means is on bosses you get one hit.  I wish I had bought it bitd.  Even before nintendo.  I was just sure though that it was a cheaper version of the genesis game which I saw as such graphical and technical perfection that I knew this wouldnt live up to that level and I thought this would actually be much worse than it is.  Its great.  Alright!  Ibeat the first boss and released a bunch of cute bunnies and birdies!  I also loved that about the original genesis game:  You were saving the enemies not killing them and you saved a bunch at the end of the level.  it made me feel really good.  The level 2 theme is really catchy.  You know what the platforming gets too hard a few levels in where you have to jump onto a little log from far away.  The waterfall level is one of those silly situations where if you advance the screen 1 inch above the ground hit box then you die if you land back on the ground.  The whole waterfall level is kind of crappy because of it being so unforgiving on the perfect platforming and some of the platforms dont land right which gets really frustrating.  Ok 3rd boss down using some save states and a bit of rewind.  Now I'm in Labyrinth zone.  The slowdown in the water level was pretty crappy and the slow sonic underwater platforming is not that fun.  Looks like I'm about half way through.  One weird thing is the spikes have horrible sloppy and unfair collision boxes.  I like this idea for making games easy: If its a kaizo trick that I couldn't have seen coming then rewind is ok.  I just beat it!  It was pretty fun and pretty short and I would have liked it as a kid.  I wonder though if I could beat it without save states.  The last words in the game are "Presented by Sega   End"  And it locks up which is kind of funny :) 
* Space Harrier GG 1/8/2020 - Continue structure is great because it has limited continues but then gives you a short password!  The gameplay is pretty terrible and the graphics are too super chunky with unmasked sprites  :(
* Sonic Game Gear 1/8/2020 - This version is pretty close to the master system version but a few differences: I think the invincibility sphere is smaller which intrigues me about the size of the sprites.  Its just barely as big as sonic in a ball not nearly as big when hes walking.  In the master system one the sphere is just as big as the player.  
* Gleylancer - 1/8/2020 - This is amazing.  There are so many cool things about this the graphics, ships, playability, collision, shooting powerups, controls (which there are 6 options for controlling your sidearms).  I beat the first level with just a few rewinds.  Its really great. I tried it without rewind and didnt make it through the first level.  It doesnt actually start you over at the beginning when you die ther are invisible checkpoints.  Lets try it again.  The high score entry is one of the coolest Ive seen.  Theres a very tricky part at the end of world 1 where you are supposed to not go after a powerup or you will die.  Its so tempting and I'm sure theres a very tricky way when you have ltos of skills to do it but you have to be very good and plan ahead.  Continue structure seems great.  YOu have a few lives to beat the level and then unlimited cotninues if you don't starting you at the beginning of that level.  Also it asks if you want to cahnge your shot type.  I did it with 3 ships left!!! Hey I nearly beat the next level in one life!  This game is really really good.  The collision on the ship is just perfect.  Its all very fair and fantastic.  The weapons are so cool.  The levels are amazing.  I love this so much.  This level I'm on now has a boss which closes you in to a tiny space and I haven't beaten it yet even after getting there like 10 times.  Lets see if I can do it with rewind.  Yeah i can beat it without too much trouble with rewind.  Ok after many more tries I finally beat that boss just now with only save states but not with rewind.  I am on level 11 now with rewind through the previous few levels and its great.  I love how the big enemies change color when hit, The palette changes to brighten them up its not an external glow but it looks great and is an excellent representation of them being hit.  Beat it!  I dont honestly think I could have beat the last few levels without rewind, but its still one of the fairest shooting games I've played.  its great.  
* Streets of Rage 2 - 1/8/2020 - This is a pretty good beatemup with small sprites but actually really great combat.  Its really fun punching in this game where thats not always true.  
* Hybris - 1/8/2020 - Hybris this has a great trainer which lets you start on any stage.  I'm playing on the mac on FS-UAE with an ADF.  I've played 2 games and havent gotten very far.  I'm using the trainer that lets you have all 5 powerups when you start, but honestly its really hard not to lose them quickly. Alright!  After trying many time s(probaly 7) II completed the first boss and stage! I'm proud!  I didnt have any lives left though but  its very fun!  Lets try it wihtout the trainer.  The continue structure is great! It lets you continue unlimited from the beginning of each stage.  Thats awesome imho.  Update: Its got credits on the first screen .. does that mean it only gives you on econtinue???  I love this game.  Continues seem unlimited and even better they dont start you off at the beginning of the level.  Thats wonderful!  The continues are only to get highscore it looks like.  Its so fun.  I got to level 2 fairly with no save states and on many legit cotninues.  Maybe 100 retries with save states and continues and I finally beat level 2.  I have no idea how I could beat some of these enemy patterns without save states.  One of the hardest ones are guys that come out of the side you're not nearest to at points near your vertical position and then fly in and shoot and then dip slightly randomly making it hard to avoid them and there are many of them really hard to dodge or shoot.  I would like the plane to be faster honestly.  
* SWIV - 1/8/2020 Amiga - I had this game aand loved it so much. I got pretty far (for me) and I played it again a week or two ago for my amiga project.  The ADF has lots of cool trainer options like lives and autofire.  I'm using unlimited continues, and autofire and spread missiles.  Doing it this way you are effectively invincible so its fun but not that fun.   To get it to run I had to use some 1MB chip ram and PAL mode and auto resolution and Kickstart 1.3 A500.  I beat the first big gun boss with unlimited continues
* Fantasy Zone - 1/8/2020 SMS - This sucked because there are no continues and the 2nd boss is silly difficult.  Getting a nupgrade would help but that shouldnt be required to just beat a boss because then you lose it and have to grind to get another upgrade but you cant count on it.  You can't be sure you will win if you make any mistakes.  that kind of unforgivness is silly imho.
* Golden Axe - 1/8/2020 SMS - This is so good.  I remember buying this and loving it because I could actually beat it once or twice.  I felt so accomplished. I really wanted it to have more characters and be two player but as it was it was super fun and looked great and played even better.  THe jump over the pit is still stupid and cheap and shouldnt be there.  having that there means your whole game can be ruined by a few tiny errors and having to learn techniques that you otherwise dont need to know or care about.  The player moves faster in this game which is nice.  Its not cheap in terms of your reach.  I beat it just now and got an A but I was using some rewind and I remember getting a really bad score bitd but at least I won!  I never felt like I had really mastered it because I didnt get a good grade.  
* Streets of Rage 2 - 1/8/2020 Gen - This is really cool game. The fighting is near perfect. the enemies arent cheap on normal mode (Until you get to zamza the level 3 boss).  I beat level 3.  There are lots of rom hacks which let you play as other characters or a few different fighting features or the ninja turtles!  The wrestler ABADEBE is much less cheap than the ZAMZA blanka like boss. The continue structure sucks.  2 continues and thats it.  Options menu lets you select 5 lives per continue but thats not enough to be a fair challenge for non-experts.  R. Bear is cheaper than even ZAMZA.  I lost 4 lives on him the third time I tried.  Its pretty long too so it gives a lot of content for this one game.  Its great but I am a bit bored honestly.  1/11/2020 I beat stage 7 without using save states and with just a bit of rewijnd.  I lost like 3 lives.  One lame thing is fi you run out of time you lose a life.  Stage 8 clear with lots of rewind and one more continue - 5 lives left.  I beat it!  Hey the credits song is really catchy and fun.  This is a great game.  Interesting: in openemu with the ds4 attached as bt and wired I was able to somewhat control two characters at one time since it saw them as separate controllers.  if I can get that trick working more reliably I think it mmight be fun to play two at once and just not pay attention to both. 
* The adventures of square - 1/10/2020 Doom Mod - This is really fun to play through with the puzzles being interesting and reminding me of Overload for PC if that is possible and the shooting being fun and controls being great.  I'm re-learning FPS controls on controller so I can play on the couch.  This is a really good game.  One cool thing about this game is you can download it on its own as a standalone game.  
* Space Hunter Doom Mod - 1/10/2020 - I'm having the best time playing through the Doom2 levels with the space hunter mod because the shooting is more fun imho.  its pretty easy as doom mods go but its still hard enough to be interesting for me.  I get lost pretty easy and the puzzles are interesting for me plus surviving is too.  I'm having to re-learn palying FPS games wiht the ps4 controller.  Its a really good mod.  Ive played through several full map sets with this and I personally significantly prefer it to the standard gun set.  
* Doom 2 - 1/12/2020 I'm playing the DOom 2 maps with the space hunter mod and these maps are a bit weird but also awesome. I'm spending 30-45 minutes solving the puzzles which makes me feel a bit stupid but I am not beating myself up too much I'm just having to lookin every nook and cranny.  I dont think the keys should be hidden in secrets I have to look at the map to find secret areas to find the keys and exit but I feel like I should be able to explore everywhere visible to find the keys and exits.  I found a secret to go to a wolfenstein level!  It was pretty cool!  In one case on the suburbs level the exit is so secret that you have to hit a secret unlabeled column, but if you hit it from the wrong angle (i.e. any of the flat sides like every other door in the game) the column moves but the door doesnt open.  If you hit it from the right angle then it opens the door  you need.  Tenements was frustrating. I loved exploring every nook and cranny its always fun, until I got to a point where I didnt know where to go even looking at every littl eline on the map.  finally After looking in the same place 4 times I had flipped some switch or opened some wall somehow to let me finally reach the exit.  It took 45 min total and was frustrating for probably 20 of those.  I played it again and it took under 15 min.  Par was 7 min.  I'm pretty happy with 15min, but I feel like trying it again. First time was just under 47 min, second time under 15, third time under 10, fourth time I beat par!  6:57!!!
* Doom the Way Id DId DTWID - Therea re a lot of good maps here probably slightly better than d2 imho.  e3m7 is a  masterpiece imho.
* Hard Reset - 1/17/2020 - I just started this game and I love it. The shooting and graphics are really satisfying and exciting and the enemies are scary.  I actually love the graphics.  I like that there are upgrades and that you are encouraged to use the environment to destroy your enemies.  I like that there are fair checkpoints.  The mouse user interfaces on the in game computers actually work really well and I like the puzzles which so far are just right for me.   They don't have me looking all over for a long time but are also non-obvious.  Its cute how since you cant crouch in the game they cover impassible gates with half a grate on the top half so it would physically be easy to crawl under but you know in the game you can't.  I really like this game.  I encountered a bug in the parking garage where I killed all enemies but the gate wouldn't open.  It took several tries to do it in the first place but I had to restart the checkpoint (by turning off the game) and then when I beat them again several tries later I was able to get through.  One thing I dont love is you can't play each level from any moment.  You can only continue from the checkpoint or restart the level you are on or just beat.  This is not a big deal but it would be nice to be able to go back somehow and retry each level.  If I were trying to get through a game using speedruns or get fastest scores or speed I would want that feature.   Wow I love the first huge boss the Atlas.  Hes so big and awesome and a fun battle.  As soon as I got to the second boss (the big crawly thing on buildings) gosh it got way harder.  Many encounters after seems to be harder too.  I spent like an hour on that boss, and the next major encounter is multi faceted and taking a really long time too.  The waves of enemies in this part aren't really matching the environment not giving me enough cover from these types of enemies.  Some of the enemies (specifically the flying ones) are not fun because its not clear when you have hit them and they dodge your shots, and its not clear how to even consistently hit them and they take way too many hits and theres no way to take real cover from them and not take damage.  11h later I beat it and this is a great game.  I loved it.  Beat it on 1/24/2020
* Soul Calibur VI - 2/1/2020 - I love this so much.  the music is amazing and even goes into a hobbiton kind of song when you go into a town.  I love the adventure mode and the character creation and all of the different quests and stories you get in this mode. played 3 hrs last night and 1.5 today.  Its so fun and cool.  I got into a match that was 15 levels over mine (45-30) and it took probably 15 min but I finally won and learned some new skills on the way.  Its so good.  haha Azwel said "How dare you interrupt me mid-monologue".  This game does a fantastic job of training you on the major combat features by putting you in different scenarios where the only way out is to learn it enough to beat an opponent who without that technique is impossibel to beat.  I spent like 10 tries on Ivy before I got good enough at anticipating her moves (shes got some mean combos that keep you far away and take down your soul meter).  Thej ending to the story is cool and doesn't jsut dump you into the credits.  I like that there is some dialogue after the final boss battle. 

* Kirby Planet Robobot 3-31-2020
  - Stage 2 - the robot stuff here is so cool
  - Stage 4 patched plains - the perspective at the beginning is so cool!
  - This first clanky woods battle is really cool with several parts!
  - 2-2 is a cool shmup ina. City with an absolutely awesome boss.  I would absolutely play a full game like this
  - 2-4 is a cool casino background hey and it’s the cool 3D pool table level great fun catchy tunes
  - 3-4 has a cool snowmen heads you have to fill with ice and amazing creamsicle ice cream swirl cones falling on you
  - Overload ocean stage 5 has a really cool 3D background and foreground thing going up and down a lot which is awespme
  - Gigabyte grounds 3 has a cool Rube Goldberg machines
  - Gigabyte grounds 5 is a great shooter with great 3d
  - 4-3 2020
  - Rhythm route 2 - huge pool balls in the front layer
  - Access ark 4 is awesome!  The environment is so damn cool
  - The credits can be punched!  The whole final boss battles series is cool with great forgiving continue structure and let’s you load up on power ups before each boss if you die
  - I beat it on 4/15/2020 and it’s really cool
  - It unlocks a really cool speed run Survival mode called Meta knight mare mode which has a great bat mechanic that I love flapping those wings
* Mario 3D land
  - 2-4 has a Mario 1 theme even to the point that there’s and end sectionnthays awesome for 3D Mario 1
  - 5-3 is like a Zelda dungeon with secrets and the Zelda sound and all
  - 3-4 water level let’s you get a fireflpwer
  - In 5-2 there’s a bonus room with a 1up near the top left and a fireflpwer below it some
    - 5-2 has a cool place at the beginning where you can jump up and into the camera
    - And a hidden fireflpwer at the beginning
  - 5-4 is pretty good for 1ups and a fire flower
  - 5-5 has a ton of 1ups in a stack of goombas
  - 6-3 has a really cool piano level
* Altered beast 3D classics 2-29-2020
  - The 3D is fine
  - There is local Wireless multiplayer!
  - It should have more difficulty options.  It doesn’t even have unlimited continues which blows my mind
  - At least it has save states
  - I wonder if the non Japanese version is different with continues?
  - 
* Sonic 3DS 3D classics 2-29-2020
  - There’s a built in level select which I think is wonderful
  - Then there’s a save and load 
  - And some great 3D options where it’s full 3D layers going in or popping out a bit and also an option to be flat but on an old school 3D curved CRT 
  - I got through the third stage on just 2 lives including the boss!
  - 4-11 I got through labyrinth zone on 3 lives but couldn’t beat the boss.  I could only hit him twice.  I bet there’s a strategy but so far I don’t like this boss 
  - 4-19  I got through whole labyrinth zone on 3 lives in fact lost one and gained one so ended up with 3!
  - 4-20 I got through labyrinth zone Again and then beat star light with 1 remaining
  - Man this game is so damn cool.  I never owned a genesis as a kid but I thought it was the coolest damn thing It was super high tech making all these amazing 3D (appearing due to parallax) graphics and amazing beautiful sounds.  I thought the volume on the console was wicked so you could play in private and I thought the curves were out of this world.  It was so cool.  This was over before I knew anything about SNES (and before it was released)
  - I rented sonic at least twice (which also meant I had to rent a genesis which I remember being $15 for the weekend)
  - I remember not getting very far and getting pretty frustrated.  I think if I had really just played it a little bit every day I would have eventually beat it
  - The last time I remember renting it I remember getting to world 2-1 but not getti much further.  That’s about as far as I typically got back in the day.  
  - I never figured out how the chaos emeralds worked only once or twice ever got one didn’t know how to activate the bonus levels (for me it seemed totally random to get the big ring actually I think I thought you had to be moving fast when Th e level ended) I never got any good at the bonus levels and never realized that those emeralds were something worth collecting and I don’t know if I could have anyway.  Actually I’m not sure I ever got entirely though the border surrounding the chaos emeralds
  - So I didn’t get many one ups from the bonus stages and in the regular stages I wanted to go really fast and felt like if I’m playing this game right I’ll be able to speed through each of the levels but I know now that’s not the case
  - That’s also why level 2-1 puzzled me there’s no way to go fast
  - If I had owned it or had more patience with it I could have beat it because now on 4-20 I got through labyrinth with 4 lives remaining and The next world all three levels and boss with 1 lives remaining
  - I remember that last time I rented it something weird happened in my brain.  I found a trick in a magazine like start plus a or something when on the title screen and it sent me to a level select!  Today I have one on my 3DS built into the game but back then I didn’t know what to think of it.  I tried a few random levels and died quickly and finally I tried the final boss and it was really cool seei Ng the final boss but of course I died quickly several times and had to start over.  After thAt though ... I felt different about the game.  I felt like I had (inexplicably I know) seen or mastered the whole game or some feeling like that and I had much less desire to play it anymore.  There were two aspects as far as I could tell: 1.  Now I could play any part of the game all of the difficulty was removed (even though I hadn’t beaten all but like 4 it felt that way) and 2. I felt like I had pretty much beaten or unlocked or experienced all it had to offer.  It’s weird in hindsight but that was in my head and I still held it in high esteem but didn’t want to play it so much anymore. 
  - In 2003 I played it again on DC or Xbox and remember thinking how stupid the 2nd world was how you couldn’t go fast at all. That’s kind of how I felt about the game until recently.
  - Spring zone zone 3 has the best music in the game imho the second part of the music is so catchy and cool and interesting and fun.
  -  the pinball parts In this game we’re so bad ass because they were better more fun momentary pinball action (the bouncing and sounds and stuff) than any other game I’d played outside of an actual pinball machine.  They made it feel super modern to me like a game within a game and I loved thay
  - I remember one of the most stressful things in SMB was the situations where you had to perform the Difficult action perfect there was no way to get around it there was no safety net or backup plan.
  -   In most situations in SMB there was a safety net at least in design because In most situations you can be in control of whether you are large and then if you get Hit you just go small.
  - For most jumps it would be if You Jump too late you die but if you jump a bit too early that can be ok so you don’t have to perform perfect ther is wiggle room.  Or if you undershoot you die but if you overshoot You land safely
  -   There were some big jumps that didn’t give you any safety net tho like on I think 8-2 or 4-3 where there’s a big leap where you have to run over a little gap and then land on a single block and then quickly jump again while still running.  It’s pretty easy for me now but bitd that was very difficult and scary because you knew that there was no way to get into that situation and not have to perform perfectly to beat it
  - Well sonic has a lot more situations where you have to perform perfectly to beat them.  Instant kills and unforgiving jumps and movements.  You have to make the jump just right and if you don’t well not only do you have to backtrack but you are often hit or killed and sometimes thrown into lava or knocked back down a cliff
  - Something I just noticed consciously but I think I knew subconsciously in the past is that in some ways the Mario games are faster.  No the character doesn’t actually move faster, but the levels are designed with generally less waiting and more left to right so you can run more than many of the sonic levels where you have to take it real slow and careful
  - Sometimes like on 2-2 the checkpoint can be behind you or out of the normal path which I don’t feel like Mario does to you
  - Also the bricks in the second world aren’t as beautiful of a sexy checkerboard they aren’t as clean or modern as the bricks on the first level
  - As of 4-20 I’ve had this cart for about 4 yrs (since 2016 at the latest) and first played this game in 1990 but right now learning it and getting really good at it level by level with its beautiful sexy Ultra modern in 90s Graphics plus the incredible 3D parallax thay I love so much is one of the funnest and most satisfying gaming experiences of my life.  I’m loving it
* New Super Mario 2
  - I love this!
  - One thing I don’t love is how it blurs when the 3D is deeper.  I understand why they did that and it’s a cool enough feature but I wish you could just turn it off.  I like to be able to focus on whatever i want at any depth and this doesn’t let me.  Yeah it’s more realistic but it’s less interesting to my eyes and brain and heart
  - I don’t love how you have to beat a castle to save
  - They give you lots of one up opportunities at least
  - 1-4 has some cool ways to get one ups
  - 2-4 there’s a pipe where you goomba jump for unlimited
  - 2-midcastle great place for leaves
* Kid Icarus Uprising 3D
  - Wow here are some of the reasons why this is one of the best games ever made
  - Adjustable difficulty every time you start a level With a transparent user interface to do so
  - Amazing integrated tutorial
  - Easy to replay levels
  - Great full length game
  - Amazing 3D graphics
  - Great Unique controls Which work great
  - Part of the game is like space harrier
  - Amazing narration
    - Great voice acting
    - Teaches you things
    - Breaks the fourth wall sometimes with pixelated jokes like the 3 headed dragon
  - It plays a funny song when reapers see you that seems totally out of place but it’s from the NES game!
  - Huge beast bosses
  - Exciting flying
  - Shows you direction to go in
  - Hearkens to the old game with most of the same enemies and power ups and bosses and even the music 
  - The bickering hydra heads are hilarious 
  - The game has somewhat of a teen anime sense of humor
  - I suck at this game.  The intensity slider has to be low or I die.  I still don’t know how to avoid the metroids while flying I’ve basically never avoided one.  There are lots of secrets I have no idea how to get. Like on level 3 or 4 there’s a pit that has a partial ring around it that looks like it needs to be rotated or something to get to the other side where there’s a treasure chest.  I can’t figure itnout
  - Level 5 is a really cool futuristic low poly world with tons of voice acting character and some really brilliant And interesting level designs
  - Chapter 6 has a great Spanish guitar song and a pretty large intricate level
  - This game is a must buy if you have any interest in how cool the 3D can be on this system.  It’s the best example and it would be a great AAA game on any system even without the stereo
  - Spoiler Alert One of these levels was like the final battle but then when I beat it the credits started rolling but then a worse boss interrupted them and the game started again :)
  - On level 10 I got turned into a shrimp and eaten
  - On 11 it’s a scary nuclear bomb!
* 3D Gunstar Heroes
  - It was so cheap at like $5.99 and so good
  - I beat the first stage on my first try
  - It’s forgiving the way I’ve got it set I set it easy mode and with double life I think
  - I would have died without that double life but I wonder how far back I would go or how many lives I have.  I wonder about the continue structure
  - The 3D is actually really great I’ve got it in pop out mode but it does take more eye adjusting than most of the games I’ve played on here 
  - I think that makes it pop more but there’s a side border for both eyes that’s visible 
  - I’ve gotten through most of the other levels without more than a couple retries and now I’m on probably stage 6 a horizontal shooter level
  - The 3D parallax when you’re on the Spaceship is really cool and the rotating power station boss is awesome! This would have blown my mind if i ever could have gotten to it bitd 
  - The last boss rush was tough but still only took me a few tries.  This mode is super fair.
  - I’m really proud that I beat this game.  It’s so good
  - The ending cinematic was fun and even slightly touching they included some emotion.  I loved it!
  - I have no idea if I ever would have been able to beat this bitd. 
  - It does seem to have unlimited continues and the final boss for example it starts you right there and even gives you a weapon upgrade 
* About 3ds
  - This is the first stereoscopic system and the tech is really cool!  It’s hard to imagine how it even works!  
  - It is unique because it won’t be around forever and once the displays are dead they basically can’t be replaced.  You will still be able to play the games but in 2030 you’ll be able to play ps3 wii nds switch even NES but it’s not certain you’ll be able to play 3DS
* BlasterMaster Zero 3DS
  - Demo
  - Not stereoscopic
  - Area 1 and 3 available
  - Seems to be unlimited lives and checkpoints everywhere
  - Controls are tight and the game is just like NES!
  - The music is epic and Deeply reminds me of playing NES games
  - Weird thing about the colors is underground whether 2d or 3D when you’re moving the brown background blurs in such a way that the whole screen seems to go dark.  It’s distracting and disconcerting 
  - The overhead areas are cool but I don’t think they could have been done on NES. They have parallax and are SNES worthy.  Update: the nes overhead areas looked amazing for the time with a huge character.  These look better but wow!  Nice work sunsoft!
  - I beat the boss of area one!  This is a really fun game!  It took Only three tries and there was a checkpoint immediately before
  - I got an upgrade to my gun!
  - I like how the two modes control so differently
  - It was cool that once I got my new weapon I could go to a few new sections of the same large map that I couldn’t get to before and that in face those weee the only places left to go really once the boss was beat
  - Great game
  - Not special on 3DS.  The steam version has some co op gameplay!  Wow the switch version has that feature too!!  Nice!  The co op is a crosshairs for the second player to shoot the enemies like operation wolf or something.  That’s really cool!  Or in boss mode it’s kind of pvp
  - I had much fun with area 1 so I think I’ll play area 3 too.  (Update: no I didn’t end up enjoying 3 tonight anyway) I don’t know but I don’t think I’ll buy this but who knows it’s clearly fantastic and worth it :). I suspect I found this back when I was looking for Metroidvanias
  - Apparently there’s a second game this one from 2017 and the new one from 2019 
* Leander
  - Amiga
  - 4-6-2020
  - Escape quits losing all lives with no continue and no mercy!
  - In my cracked version I have unlimited bombs and coins but not life (I could have selected life but didn’t)
  - You can select twin button joystick
  - You can pick how many lives (Max 5) and credits (Max 3) you get and the difficulty of the game in the options
  - I really wish you could go down through platforms to lower platforms 
  - There is a password to split you through the game by thirds so you have 5lives with 3 continues to beat a third of the game 
  - 4-7-2020
    - I played for many hours and had much fun
    - I got pretty good
    - I don’t understand the weapon upgrades
    - The dragon on 1-3 or 4 is far too brutal
    - I found a big problem because due to some copy protection I couldn’t beat level 1-4
    - A platform just didn’t exist
    - And I couldn’t get any version that was rumored to work to actually work on my Mac uae fsuae 
    - And I tried a lot
    - It was all depressing because I wanted to keep playing
    - Next day I got another version working and had fun
    - I got a sword upgrade so it was more fun
    - I think I accidentally also was invincible
    - But I got through the first 4 levels pretty quick probably 45min
    - Then I got through the rest of world 1!
    - The jumping on flying bags was silly. It requires such perfect timing that I think it should be much more forgiving
    - In the beginning of world 2 I found a part where I had to jump on a platform which floated up from spikes but the timing was so carefully critical that it wasn’t so much fun anymore
    - Continue Structure: 5 lives, 3 continues. Each life you start off right where you were.  Each continue you start at the beginning of the stage (1.3, 2.4, whatever).  Thats not too unfair.  You lose your weapon when you get hit or die (not sure which)
    - Hey If you have the infinite lives password in and then hit F8 the game pauses and then hold F6 and hit the fire button and it skips to the next level!
* Magic Pockets
  - I had some fun playing up to level 7 or 8 with heavy use of save states
  - 4-6-2020
  - Amiga
  - The power ups were too complicated and the enemies too sort of random (their powers and behavior weren’t the same for a given enemy)
* Miles & Kilo
  - This is a cool game!  The continue structure is great and it lets you do as many continues and lives as you want
  - The 3D is subtle but I like it
* Kirbys adventure 3D classic
  - I like the 3d
  - The continue structure seems really good and lenient
* Chaos Engine
  - I read something that said that Navvie and Priest were the best duo
  - Had to do some controller configurations and while it wasn’t hard it wasn’t particularly user friendly
  - I beat level one without dying!  I never did that before!
  - Beat level 2 but died like 3 times
* VROOM Galleon VR 4-18-2020
  - Expecting a game? You’ll be disappointed

## Some of the best games ever ##

I love these games from Master System:
1. Wonder Boy 3
2. Carmen Sandiego
3. Double Dragon
4. Phantasy Star
5. Hang On/Jungle Hunt (built in)
6. Castle of Illusion starting Mickey Mouse

I loved these games from the PSX:
1. Final Fantasy VII (this was so epic and I felt like a serious gamer playing this.  Beat this summer 1998)
2. Metal Gear Solid (Same as FF7) (rented and beat this fall 1998/spring 1999)
3. Resident Evil 2 (Same as FF7) (rented and beat this fall 1998/spring 1999)
4. Castlevania Symphony of the Night
5. Jet Moto 2 (Beat this Spring 1999 - really hard to beat this)
6. Gex (Beat this Spring 1999 - It was some work to do it - really hard)
7. Ridge Racer Type 4 (Great memories of renting this and thinking how much like GT it was but how it was slightly more edgy or something)
8. Gran Turismo (This was so cool when I rented it a few times, maybe I even rented the second one)
9. Suikoden (Beat this Summer 2000 when I was playing DWIV at the same time with the other hand)
10. Tomba (I think I rented it and loved it in part but didnt buy it until much later - In like 2010 I played about half of this - I owned the 2nd game for a while too)
11. Time Crisis (I beat it in 2000)
12. Klonoa (I beat this in the 2000s but I dont know whether it was the one on the Wii? I played through half of Klonoa 2 on PS2 as well but never finished it.)
14. Xenogears (I played through about half of this and was loving it so much playing it every night as I was going to sleep, but unfortunately my memory card died and I lost all of my progress :( it was one of those fancy high capacity memory cards) its a 60 hr game and I feel like I want to play it again and finally finish it 
15. I played a ton of Brave Fencer Mushashi and loved it but I got stuck and gave up and never came back to it.  
16. Um Jammer Lammy was amazing but it was very hard so I never beat it unfortunately
17. Soul Blade probably my favorite on the system I unlocked all of the characters even the secrets.  
18. Wipeout XL I played the hell out of this and I feel like I beat it but I dont remember when or what that would have really meant
19. Spyro the Dragon - Betsy got me hooked on this but I beat it on my own it was very fun exploring this awesome 3d world.  I loved it so much and remember the final boss. I owned the 2nd and 3rd game at one point but never played either except enough to fly around a bit I remember that. 
20. Final Fantasy 8 (Got about halfway through this actually)
21. Twisted Metal 2 - I played about half of this in the 2000s but never beat it and certainly didnt play it enough bitd, but what a great game in every sense.  Multiplayer was epic.  
22. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver - I played this for a bit on PSX, but then decided the DC version was the one to play and beat the whole game on Dreamcast.  It seemed like it took an eternity and it probably did but it was a really cool game.
23. Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain - I remember playing this at Lyndie's house and it was so damn cool, I remember the load times being really annoying and not knowing where to go after a while and getting stuck, but I got many hours in proabably half way through it and it was really really cool and I loved the lore.  I think there were problems with it loading or something. 

I Always wanted to play or master these from the PSX:
1. Parasite Eve (Don't really know why I didnt play and beat this because I wanted it so bad) (Had a demo of it which I loved very much)
2. Vagrant Story - I owned this at one point in the 2000s without a case but never really played it
3. Chrono Cross
5. Final Fantasy 9 - I owned this but never played it more than for just a few minutes.  
6. Wing Commander 3 (or 4?) (I bought it at Hastings hoping Betsy and I could play it together but it didnt load :( 
7. Everything in me said I should get Lunar: The Silver Star Complete collection for PSX but for some reason I never jumped on it.  I bet I would have freaking loved it.  It came with a map too!
8. Suikoden 2 - never bought this one
9. Time Crisis Project Titan - I owned this but only played it for a few minutes.  It was cool although it didnt draw me in quite like the first . there wanst anything wrong but the first one was so damn cool and immersive as a bad ass and this one didnt make me feel the same way.
10. All other Guncon games - I owned most of them in the 2000s but hardly played any of them.  
11. Tenchu Stealth Assassins - I had this for a while and it was so cool
12. Einhander - Same It was really cool but I didnt spend much time with it unfortunately
13. Gradius V - Dust had this and I played it at his work and it was just so cool with that awesome 3D (Wasnt there a darius game?  Wasnt there a space fish?)
14. Ergheiz - I loved this for a few days and thought it was so cool
15. Parappa the Rapper was pretty fun for a while.
16. Frequency - Dust said it was great
17. Tekken 2 I played a bit of and it was really cool.  I hardly played 3 at all.
18. Alundra - Dust or Chuck had this and showed it to me and MAN I loved it so much just seeing the pictures of it. 
19. Bushido Blade - I had some real fun with this for a few days because it was so cool it seemed like a strategy fighting game to me at the time, but I didnt get very far.
