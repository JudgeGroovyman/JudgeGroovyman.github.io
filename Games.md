# Crossplay VR #

6. Trackmania Turbo - this sounds like too much fun!!!
1. No Mans Sky comes out on VR for all platforms cross-play this Wednesday.  Its an enormous space sim where you can explore a whole galaxy. https://www.roadtovr.com/no-mans-sky-vr-psvr-announcement/ but its probably super complicated
2. Star Trek Bridge Crew (I own this now but have only played it once and didnt get anywhere
3. Rec Room, remember that time we played a quest or mission or whatever?  I can't say my performance held any water but it was a cool adventure and I would totally do that again.  Plus we could rock the battle royale feature that all the teenagers are playing these days.  They will totally snipe us from 200 miles the first few times we play but we might be able to figure out ways to hadoken the hell out of them.
4. Eve Valkyrie - Cross Platform Space Battle Sim
5. Sports Bar VR - Like Rec Room but more realistic looking
8. VRChat (Is this PSVR?)
9. Eagle Flight
10. Werewolves Within


## Other Multiplayer ##
1. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes
I think with Big Screen sharing enabled this might work.  Probably thats too much for the computer to handle though.

In other news I bought Skyrim VR (haven't played yet) and I just beat a game called Bloodstained Something or other of the Night which was made by the same guy who made Castlevania Symphony of the Night and it was really cool and I might play it again.
