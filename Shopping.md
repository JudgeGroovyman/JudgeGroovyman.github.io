 Over Ear
1. $30 mic reviews are good 12.7k pretty good reviews https://www.amazon.com/Vislla-Bluetooth-Headphones-Sweatproof-Earphones/dp/B07WWG151L I bought these.  I like cristis case much better.  These take much longer to swap in and out of the case.  its only a matter of seconds but heres are ~1-2s and these are ~4-8s due to the two handed zipper.  The bluetooth has a .5s delay or so with my computer.  Totally noticeable and I dont love that.  side effect is its kind of cool for watching fast guitar because I can hear it, instantaneously wonder how he made htat sound adn then watch him make taht sound.  the audio sounds great though.  The charging in the case is inside making it a little unwiedly esp when compared to cristis which you can charge wirelessly or plug in on the rear.  Whoa a little while later I had my garageband instrument volume maxed although the ovverall volume was medium and the headphones totally freaked out clipping and sounding terrible while it was playing. Turning it down fixed it.  You can't charge the phones in the case while the case is zipped up.  People will say "Yes you can!" but at least with my set you cannot reliably because zipping the case pushes on the ear circles which levers the phones just off the copper contacts enough to not charge.  battery lasts for like 10-12h for me which is really great.  Theres a weird artifact any time you pause or change the sound on your device: pause and for the first instant it will be in only one ear and not the other.  This also happens if you are fast forwarding on youtube every tiem you hit the arrow key and that whole artifact is a little disconcerting.  Interesting that when the case isn't charged then putting the phones in there doesnt even turn them off.  Thes ethings have blueetooth issues.  When they are on sometimes the ps4 controller or keyboard or trackball just dont connect.  Turn these earbuds off and those things have no problems.  It makes them kind of painful to use.  Also when I go to the bathroom they de-sync and you get right ear left ear back and forth with cut out which is pretty disconcerting.  Feb 5, now sometimes when you put them in the dock they make a high pitched whine, its not super audible from more than 10ft prob not at all, but from 2ft its really annoying and hold it up near your ears and its like a terrible bug sound.  then it stops.  weird.

2. $12.99 LOVE THESE 282 good reviews, nr mic, https://www.amazon.com/Earphones-Microphone-Cancelling-Headphones-Sweatproof/dp/B07GSRNVBQ/  Bought these.  The mic is totally workable and the nr works great.  compared to the earpods mic this one is muffled on the high end so its not as crystal clear but the nr works nearly as good.  both of them pop a bit between recordings.  the volume control on the mac goes all the way down with one button press or back th eother way.  THey are super comfortable even to sleep on my side on the plug comes off at a cool angle which I think its good for preventing the inevitable kinking.  These are my current favorites and I use them a lot.

# Cars #
1. Simple: Autotrader has free carfax
2. Medium: Subscribe to consumer reports for $10 for one month while you are shopping so you can find out statistical reliability
3. Advanced: To be thorough get an independent inspection done.  either take it somewhere on a test drive or dfw has mobile mechanics that will go to your car and inspect it before you buy.  Expect to pay $150-200
4. Super Advanced: Warranty companies are shoppable too because some never pay out and some pay out no problem.  comparison shop those too.  In my experience dealership warranties for older used vehicles are not worth it.  exception: 30-90 day may be worth it in case of major problems that no one knew about.
