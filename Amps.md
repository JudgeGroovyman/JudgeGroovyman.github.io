Quotes

- Piranha - [Hey talks about quality amps having a harmonic ringing and this one does](https://youtu.be/2TTDflrZwKM?t=394) he gets harmonic overtones in his headphones because it adds a harmonic character that is really only found in the old classic fenders and vox amps.  14m0s:'They're ringing like a bell'
- Piranha - high gain tone is good, combined with another amp its good, Reviews aren't universally complimentary
- Micro Dark "what if I tried using the effects loop on the Micro Dark amp...so I ran the send output to the input of the pedal board, and the output of the pedal board to the return input on the MD...HUGE DIFFERENCE !! The effects all sound soooo much better and the guitar has it's nice clean tone back minus the distortion !! ... I just not enjoying it, I'm loving it !! The Micro Dark with the G12T-75 Celestion speaker in the Marshall cabinet has taken over my home studio. I'm getting so many great tones, at all volume levels. Great distortions, great cleans...sounds great at very low volume too !! This set up is just working out so well for me, and now the effect pedals I have sound better than ever. "
- Mark 5 "The Mark V head is brilliant, but there's almost too many options. I can get such good cleans with reverb I sold my Silverface Princeton Reverb, the only thing I miss is the bias trem. Does it sound exactly BF clean? No. But it sounds great, and it gets tones from the other channel a SF/BF Fender never will. Plus the footswitchable contour control works good - set it on noon, at gig volumes you get singing sustain on the edge of controllable feedback. I can use it in my old-fashioned dance band with my 335 and Gretsch, or the modern band with PRS Custom and Strat. It does everything with the 2-mode channels, and you only need to tweak gain and treble slightly - if you're au fait with the Boogie 'set the gain and treble right' it' childsplay getting good tones. "

Other Options
1. Any regular tube amp with a tube preamp stage and FX loop and just run that preamp signal out to an amp sim pedal or speaker emulator or IR Power Amp Simulator or something and experiment to figure out what sounds good. (this is pretty high baggage)
2. Attenuator between the power amp and speaker of a regular tube amp (this is pretty high baggage) (See attenuator section)
3. Tube Headphone Amp
4. Tube Preamp
5. Tube Amp Sim Pedal or FX

## Details ##
- 6505/5150 "Also, the effects loop has a poorly-designed buffer that robs all your low-end and adds fizz whenever you're using the loop (it even does this if you simply run a patch cable from send to return.) Eventually, you'll want to use the loop for delay, reverb, etc. It is a very simple fix, but you've got to be somewhat proficient with a soldering iron. It involves soldering a capacitor to the legs of a resistor just behind the effects loop "send" jack. Peavey endorses this fix. Anyway, it took me about 10 minutes to do it, and the sound is now the same whether the effects loop is used or not.   The big reason to do that is so you can run an EQ pedal in the effects loop. That is the most important upgrade to any 5150/6505, IMO. If you thought the amp crushed before doing so -- wait until you try it with an EQ."

### Quotes ###
- "for heads the H and K clean tone is beautiful. Crystal clear and the little 5 watt head isnt too pricey and will give you bedroom cleans. the Blackstar stuff is probably also worth a look. ... HT 5 Clean I like, think the cleans on the Hughes and Kettner if you are using it as a dedicated clean amp are better than blackstars though" [Rob Chapman Forum](https://www.robchapman.tv/forum/threads/best-small-tube-head-for-clean-tone.33759/page-2)
- "If you like the sound of a Fender champ then you'll love the cleans of the VHT Special 6. The cleans are nothing like a Fender tweed. The cleans are more like a BF champ, on steroids. The Special 6 is a bit on the bright side but manageable. These amps also take OD pedals very well."  [Convince me to buy a VHT](https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/vht-special-6-cleans.1324893/))
- For the VHT Special 6 [They released the schematic](http://chasingtone.com/yourguitaramp/youramp-reviews/vht-special-6-review/))
- Mesa "I've read many a time that a Mesa Mark I has the best Blackface clean sound out there. Original or reissue in a head" ... "Mesa Boogie specifically the Mark 2A (the best cleans of the Mark Series) Twin like cleans all day, but even tighter/more focused"
- "And I have this to say - NOTHING sounds like a good Twin Reverb with JBL's. ... You say what you say because you've never played a FYD or SMS rackmounted TR preamp into a McIntosh MC50 or Carvin DCM200L into a pair of SSP 1X12 cabs loaded, of course, with JBLs. Not only would they sound quite like a good TR - actually, I'll argue better - but you'd be able to bring them to gigs and use them at any volume level"
- "Morgan RV40 is spectacular, sounds killer through my 4x12 with a H30/V30 too. It's quickly becoming my favorite clean amp"
- "For big power BF cleans, a Showman....for less power a Bandmaster...if you like the Bandmaster but you want something spongier and more compressed still, a Tremolux. Those are the BF era Fender heads with the classic AB/AA763 preamp circuit (same as was used in the Twin Reverb and the Deluxe Reverb). No reverb though. Can't really go wrong with any of 'em if you're looking for classic BF Fender 6L6GC cleans in a head. And they're relatively inexpensive to boot!"
- Bassbreaker: Problem with FX Loop Hum "first run (2017) has a faulty effects loop - both heads and combos .. Any Fender repair will fix the loop with a factor kit, at no charge to you. the fix is quick and at no charge to the consumer. ... the updated ones will have a plastic fx send jack, if it's all metal it has not been updated! "
- Bassbreaker: "If you need an amp that is squeaky squeaky clean for fuzz, od, distortion, you might want to look somewhere else.  ... It is a real rock and roll amplifier.  Its single ended so you can drive it really hard, ... but you will have to master the art of manipulating the guitars volume and tone controls to regulate the amount of gain that you want from the amplifier.  I love playing in that fashion.  I think its liberating going with just a single cable right into an amplifier like this that is really cooking and make it through that show.  " [From Some Love for the Fender Bassbreaker 007](https://youtu.be/sSFWjAnkd5A?t=442)
- Bassbreaker: "To sound bigger with this amp, put the volume at 3 o'clock, the gain at the minimum and use a good fuzz or overdrive pedal for your dirt. "  Thats a good tip for a lot of amps. Volume high, gain low, boosts in front

## Quotes ##
- Super Champ "I've had both and I can assure you, after Fuse adjustment, the X2 is alot better. I don't know why Fender ships the amp with everything on 10 and you have to adj. it out, but it does sound alot better. The bass response is huge compared to the Xd. The XD is a little louder in the low volume range, the X2 takes over in the high volume range. The line out on the X2 is much better too."
- Super Champ "Yes, the X2 amazed me, after changing different cabs models within fuse, how much bass can be had. Fuse is very, very easy. It doesn't require much skill. You can adj. it exclusively for your guitar. That separates the X2 from the Xd."

## Quotes ##
- Quilter "If I ever play solid state.......Quilter or right back to tubes. I am also a bit of a tube snob and my ears tell me Quilter is as close as you will ever get to what tubes can do"
- Quitler "It took the pedals like a dream, it responded to my pick attack and expression like a dream"
- Quilter "if I wasn't so fussy (I am, extremely) I would probably use it for every gig as let's face it, the people listening wouldn't be able to tell the difference"
- Quilter "when the Bravado isn't here I use a Fender BDri as my main gigging amp... well, I used to, as if the Bravado isn't here, from here on in I'll be using the Quilter"
- Piranha & IR: "you could very easily just use the effects loop send straight into your interface. You can get the Two Notes Wall of Sound plugin just by buying one impulse response from them (which I think one of them is around $12) and the WoS plugin gives you the option to add a power-amp section along with the speaker impulse. So you wouldn't lose anything by not using the amp's power section. The 6505 Piranha doesn't require a load, so no harm in not having a cab connected if you wanted to record silently.  So really, armed with the Piranha and WoS, you could probably get an even better sound than I did here. I was just trying to keep it authentic and not color it with additional power amp simulation. " https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvszG5CT7M4
- Piranha & IR "Thanks to your video and advice I started messing around with my amps FX send into my interface and loaded up a tube power amp vst and impulse responses. It sounds great! Why isn't this method talked about more??? I'm using a Blackstar HT Club 50 head straight out of the FX send into my interface, with a dummy 1/4" headphone jack in the return to turn stop sound from coming out of the cab. Silent practicing and recording using a full 50 watt tube amp. It's a dream come true in my situation where micing my 4x12 cab blaring 50 watts isn't possible... lol. With the real amps actual tube preamp sound it gets that "real" feeling even though the power amp and cabinet is being taken care of via plugins. It really still "feels" and sounds like an actual live amp being mic'd up. This is awesome. I" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvszG5CT7M4

## Quotes ##
- Mustang "Try a Mustang III v2 with just a touch of gain on the Fender Super Sonic emulation. You'll never go back to tubes!"
- Mustang Unfortunately FUSE is dead now
- Yamaha THR10X Settings at the end of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLmKK5p9E80)
- Vypyr Sanpera Pedal "you'll notice some people complain that there's a time lag when they switch presets. The switch engages as you're picking up your foot, not as you're stepping down on it. Thus, it will not engage until your foot comes off. Step on it a little early if you must and lift your foot off the second you need the switch to occur. Simple as that!"
- Vypyr Sanpera Pedal "The only thing you might have to do to it is adjust the sensitivity of the expression pedal switches, so you won't have to step so hard on it to engage something like the wah-function. But there's a couple youtube videos on how to do that and they're pretty good. It's not hard, at all. It's more to adjust it according to what works for you, since you don't want it too easy, either."
- Vypyr Sanpera Pedal - Theres a mod to drill the rubber under the Expression pedal to make it softer and make the clicking better.  Theres an official mod to open it up and adjust a screw 1/4 turn on a white plate to make it click easier or harder which looks super easy.  Theres a problem with the looper volume with my amp and apparently when you update the firmware in my amp it fixes that problem.  Making these mods and then setting the amp up with some great presets would be a valuable service.
- Katana "No matter what sneakey amp or whatever knob positions i found it to be fatiguing for my ears. At the end of a 3-4 hour jam my ears and brain were exhausted. Does not happen with my main amp."
- Katana/GT1 "Set the boss GT output to small combo, set the katana amp on clean and as flat as possible, and use the GT as a modeler and effects on one and you'll get killer tones.  ... t/s rep at Boss said that the modeling/effects were the same, but those in the Katana had been tuned to the speaker cabinet"
- Katana Sneaky Amps "Katana's additional amps and effects, (some call sneaky amps) are accessible using the non-boss software KATANAFxFloorBoard."
- Katana not GT100 "I had a Gt100 for a couple years and I could not make amp models work for me all that time, direct to the board or through effects loop return on my amp with cab modeling bypassed. I connected effects loop send of my katana head to the same amps effects return and it was thick, creamy, punchy, alive.. so according to my observations, it's not. Maybe modeling part shares some guts but there is something more going on with Boss now."
- Katana - That Pedal Show during their wet dry videos talk about the inherent tiny delay in the katana and all other digital amps.  Its not noticeable to the ear on its own (note: I believe it is noticeable to the brain and thats 75% of the reason tubes are considered better is their instantaneous response to the fingers) but its noticeable when you get to working in stereo with other non delayed amps
- "Not gonna lie, this was very frustrating for me, and took quite some time. So try this, open your DAW of choise i personally use reaper. You need ASIO4ALL. Enable ID:Core Amplifier and try both 44.1kHz and 48kHz. I personally set ASIO buffer size to 224 Samples. But this might not work for everyone. Tick 'Always Resample 44.1 - 48kHz' And just see if the crackles gets worse or not. Then just try increasing or deacresing buffer size. When i was trying to fix this i had to find a really percise buffer size that worked for me. And if i change my buffersize just a littlebit i start to get crackles again. So just try changing it by very little."

# Preamps #


## Boost ##

The best explanation of why pedals matter is in [this boost video by Pete Thorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMjXLrFCOuU), especially listen to him rip with and without the pedal at 4:30. 

NOT Distortion NOT Overdrive
AKA Tone  Shaping and or Boost

Actual Preamps: According to [Why You Need A Preamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVbceQGhbdM&t=641) preamp pedals are only the ones which tone shape but stay crystal clean.  Thats interesting but not what follows here, but perhaps it would be beneficial to put one in front of these tones to add definition and clarity.  

Boost: This might be related to Pete Thorns [Treble Boosters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQFdP6PaKTk) or his [5 Pedals for Boosting your amp Tone Secrets #4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMjXLrFCOuU)

- ART Tube MP (29-$100) (Warms up and preamps any signal, some versions have variable valve voicings)

Tumnus is great for small amps (klon?)
https://youtu.be/zbvke372TKM&t=840s

Cali76 is an overdrive for your clean sound (compression for sustain)

- About [Preamps giving clarity](https://youtu.be/1gPxdl7hDKA?t=271)

2. Beano Booster: A Treble Booster pedal. Has to be at the front of your signal chain due to the germanium.  From [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGGiuhukWNo)

Vertex Boost MK1 or MK2

Nobels OD1 (or its many clones)

### Giving Life ###
There are a class of pedals which boost in just the right way that it makes a clean tone come alive.  These are the kind of pedals that might stay always on and you would really miss if you turned it off.
- EP Boost on 0 ([Talked about in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XGvRAQ0HeA&t=9m45s), also "Ultimate Overdrives Part One")
- Mojo Mojo on 0 Always on Paul Gilbert [Beginning of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5J8R2S3BZw)
- Simble Predriver (Preamp/Booster/Compressor) (Good candidate for an always on magic pedal) [Pete Thorns Review](https://youtu.be/N8zzvVmyzIw?t=117)
- Clover [More about this pedal](https://youtu.be/SVbceQGhbdM?t=203)


### Treble Boosters ###
- "Never played a Rangemaster but I own a Naga Viper ... My Mesa sounds amazing until I hit that pedal, and then its really magical"
- Find them cheap by looking for naga clone or or beano clone or rangemaster clone or treble booster or java boost clone on reverb



## Tone Shaping Preamps ##
Like the preamp section of an amp but in a pedal.  Most of these can feed a poweramp through the fx loop return and make a great sound.

$329 Richie Kotzen Tech21 FlyRig has a sansamp in it so he plays it into a clean tube amp for a small room.  He spent 6 months getting the overdrive right in that thing and he tours with JUST that and plugs into any clean tube amp, ideally one of his victory amps or he used to use marshalls.  HE needs a percussive bite to his tone.

- IRT Pulse - [How to setup Pulse on Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueVF52HDNNE) "To set up the Pulse on Macs: You have to create an aggregate I/O using "Audio MIDI Set Up."  You have to use different devices for the inputs and outputs. I used a USB Audio CODEC with two inputs and used my Focusrite as the output.  Whatever you name your new aggregate, insure your DAW is set for it. Heres the Apple support page that shows you how easy it is to create the aggregate.  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202000"
- IRT Pulse - [Great Clean Tones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueVF52HDNNE)
- Preamp Pedals [This Guy](https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/cab-sim-and-preamp-pedals-query.1989739/#post-27546321) shares an interesting perspective on replacing the tube power amp (or in this case not) "The bottom line is the critical tone shaping happens in the preamp and the speaker while a certain dynamic is added by a tube power amp which is really felt when monitoring the guitar amp. Once I start monitoring a miced guitar amp however, there is that reduction to that experience puts the speaker simulation on a nearly level playing field."
- Bulava "just finished my board and tried running a Tech 21 OMG (from an RK5) distortion into the Bulava. It sounded awesome. ... I really like the clean, too."   " thrilled to report that the AMT SS-20 works fantastically well as a pedal platform. Both my Rockett The Dude and MI Audio Crunchbox (only pedals I have lying around at the moment) sound massive through the AMT clean channel into an ADA GCS-3 cab sim"
- AMT Other Pedals F1(Fender) also: B1 (Bogner), R1(Mesa), E2(Engl), D1(Diezel), S1(Soldano), P1(5150), M1(Marshall), C2(Cornford), some are cheaper than others, 
- Ethos "you could always step up to the Ethos, killer clean tone AND a great OD tone as well"
- AMT "the pedal (P1) sounds excellent imo. It feels and sounds like I'm playing through an amp instead of a pedal (it goes through an EHX magnum and a bogner cube). What's also amazing about it is it cleans up real well when you roll your guitar's volume down. If you're thinking about getting the P1, I would go ahead and get the P2 instead. The difference between the 1 series and the 2 series is that the 2 has a clean channel when switched off, but that also makes it a non true bypass. Another downside is the clean has a fixed eq since the eq controls are assigned to the gain channel only. But on the flip side, the clean channel sounds like a nice fender and doesn't really need to be eq'd.  You should also consider the S2 as it sounds like the P1 boosted with a tube screamer - tight. The E1 I don't like much because to my ears it's lacking some low end."
- EHX 2ube "2ube with couple old RCA 12au7 has been my most used pedal for years, actually have 2 of them.   After drives as a dual tube splitter to drive stereo effects after them. You can switch it to line level if your driving FRFR speakers that want line level input or instrument if driving guitar amps. If your running wet/dry you can dial up some extra OD on the dry side if desired.  Or plug your guitar into 2ube 1 then out to your other drive pedals in loop then back to 2ube 2 as output tube buffer. Like this your guitars plugged right into a tube preamp, acts like it too, reacts very dynamically to vol roll offs and pick attack. It's a input buffer with both drive and vol adjustments. Like your cleans with a little hair on them, it can do it on that drive knob then vol knob can reign it in so its not OD input of next pedal.  So many ways you can configure this pedal. I even use it as stereo OD after synths. Old 12au7 and 12ay7 are its mojo tubes, dump the stock 12ax7wb, their awful in this pedal."

#### About the Mesa Boogie VTwin ####
- Apparently [hard to find in great working condition](https://youtu.be/ObrzKKxZaLc?t=225)
- Then again heres a contrary opinion that [they are reliable](https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/mesa-v-twin-praise.516842/)
- [About the V Twin](https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/mesa-v-twin-praise.516842/): "I love mine. I have tried to replace it with a smaller, battery-powered pedal, but without success (Catalinbread SCOD, Fulltone OCD, Keeley Metal Zone, Mad Professor MRD, MI Audio Crunch Box, Subdecay Blackstar, Vox Satchurator, and I forget what else). Everything I have tried, even if it sounds good on its own, pales in comparison to the massive tone of the V-Twin."
- [Not only overdrive]() "I used it not only as a distortion/overdrive generator in front of an amp, but also as a preamp straight into a recording deck."
- "I foolishly sold it when I bought a Mark 1 reissue because I thought I would have the "Mesa sound" covered with that amp."
- "I use one for practice direct to board. The magic ingredient for me is running a TS type pedal in front of it. It really tightens up the sound a lot. I recnt;y tried a few othee OD's in front but the TS is the only one that seems to work."
- "it's warmer and smoother than any Recto I've heard"
- "Its one of the best high gain pedals out. I wish I hadn't sold mine, its was built like a tank!"
- "An Xotic RC Booster sounds very good in front of the V Twin. If you are using humbukers , you can drive the hell out of it. It screams. very thick saturated OD. I like it best in front of a clean amp just on the verge of break up."
- "2 days ago I took it out of the recording setup and plugged it into the power amp junction (under the chassis) of my MBMKIIB combo loaded with Yellow Jackets in Triode mode and an EVM12L. I set the vtwin on the right side channel mode 2 with the gain up about 1/3 to 1/2 way. This gives a slight breakup. Nice warm sound. Push the master up and you start getting into power tube distortion. Sweet. Then I stepped on my OCDv4. Holy #$^& ! Here's the tone I've been searching for all my life. I can't stop playing. I haven't been this inspired in a long time. Turning off the OCD and switching on the BoR gave another inspiring tone. All of the sudden all my pedals sound freakin awesome! I hope the second honeymoon I'm on with the Vtwin never ends.:JAM"
- "The clean channel, however, takes pedals just like a good tube amp, so I mainly use it with headphones, in the wee, small hours before sunrise.."
- "It's that latency issue that really bugs me. I could never get used to that moment of dead silence in a live setting, so it was relegated to the studio"
- "I suse the V Twin for metal. If your un an MXR Six Band Eq after the VTwin you get incredible tone sahping options with a boost in louness, more headroom. Sounds amazing. High gain boogie tones all the way. I also run a Creations Audio Lab MK.4.23 before it, kick it for leads and I get more gain with no sound coloration. "
- "The VTwin is hands down the best Overdrive/Distorion pedal ever built (IMO). Cant understand why Mesa doent make them anymore. Im glad I got one."
- "After all these years and thousands of dollars spent on gear, my V-Twin is still my favorite pedal by far ... I have tried to replace the V-Twin with something smaller and battery powered, but it just cannot be done. Nothing has the massive low end, tone-ful girth, and easy playability of the mighty V-Twin."
- Fix for the delay "there is the irritating sound cutoff when you switch from the v-twin to bypass ... External Bypass switch, the problem is only around when you use the onboard one. Any 1 -button/2 setting footswitchshould work, there's a jack on the backside for it ... so by using the external switcing outputs, theres no sound loss when bypassing? hmm, interesting, thanks!  ... I'm assuming you mean the "dropout" when switching, and yes, an external switch aleviates the problem.  .. now when i switch from the v-twin to bypass, there is no loss in sounds, but vise versa, the sounds cuts out for a second. ... Stick a 1 megaohm resistor between the ground and signal and your set."

#### Behringer Vintage Tube Monster V999 ####
- "I've bought and then sold lots and lots of pedals. ... With the VT-999 this may be as close as I've gotten to a Marshall in a Box tone so I'm pretty pleased. Oh, a tube screamer is icing on the cake to give your tone extra punch."
- "This pedal need bow it's metaphorical head to no one.  this paddle gives you the gain stage of a hot rodded Marshall amplifier. (Tonally) Pick your poison, be it NWOBHM, Ozzy Era Zakk Wylde, Randy Rhoads and dozens of other tones that made heavy metal great. You will find it."
- "If you dial it down, you can play anything, blues to jazz to classic rock, and very low gain settings it serves to fantastically just warm up the signal of a clean guitar"
- "if you're a guitarist just starting out, and you want to distortion pedal that'll do anything you need it to, look no further.  If you're a pro, and you're looking for another color for your Distortion palette, this one deserves a place among the pantheon of the gods.  If you have an amplifier that has a fantastic clean tone but just doesn't bring the fire when it's time to turn up the heat, this one can bring Hell.  I've said a lot, but I still don't feel that I've said enough.  Just buy the damn thing."
- "I wish I had ordered it sooner.  Out of the box this thing is a beast."
- " if you get a noisy one it is not the design, exchange it for a good one. If you get one with a noise problem it is defective. Exchange it for another and you will like it."
- "This pedal literally cracks me up. I've spent upwards of $300 on real tube pedals, and not happy with the tone on most. ... After 10 minutes, I pulled out my box of JJ's ECC83s. Popped that in, and laughed all the way to the fridge for another beer after hearing a nice smooth tube OD!"
- "opens up with 9v center neg 500mV 1A power supply"
- "unless you're after a real saturated metal distortion...a very low gain works best. It'll still OD a lot with a 12AU7, but you get a wider scope of clean to dirt with the low gain tube.  A better 12AX7 gain rating 100% 5751, and exact match to a 12AX7 with a gain rating of 70% 12AT7 gain rating 60% 12AY7 gain rating 45% 12AV7 gain rating 41% 12AU7 gain rating 19%  All of the tubes sounded MUCH better than the stock....but the 12AU7 gave the wide scope of overdrive and a fuller tone that responded the best to the tone controls.  any decent tube from Tung Sol, JJ...etc will work."
- "The build quality is great, but the tube overdrive was missing the bottom end and clear not muddy distortion. So I got an electro Harmonix 12AX7E electron tube and it made a world of a difference!"

# Headphones & Monitors #

Probably worth getting really good headphones in this case.  Personally I want the solid feeling of the headphones being glued to my head and due to my head and my hair many headphones slip right off when I move around at all which makes them unusable for playing guitar so I don't want the ear cups to rotate sideways at all (because they slip off my head) and I don't really want them rotating up and down either.  I also don't want a detachable cable even though thats all the rage these days I realize that its got its practical purposes and that lots of other people want it that way.  I don't like them collapsing or folding since then its one more step to put them on (grabbing with both hands to unfold and pull apart).  If they are too large they will just slip off.

My Needs:
- No rotation
- No collapsing or folding 
- Straight Cable
- Not Detachable Cable
- Ideally over ear
- Not too loose 

See Impedances elsewhere in this note

## Headphone Notes ##
Ideal characteristics 
1. Sexy / Classy
2. Unbelievable shimmery spongy clean tones
3. Speaker Sim Headphone Out
4. Raw Line Out
5. Aux In

### No for various reasons ### 
- $127 Audiotechnica ATH-M50x (Collapsible and foldable)
- $80 Sony MDR7506 (Folding, coiled cable)

### Should work ###
- $134 Beyerdynamic DT-770 (32 Ohm, 80 Ohm, 250 Ohm models)
- $49 Audio-Technica ATH-M20x (Rotate a bit vertically)
- $68 AKG K240STUDIO (Detachable cable? Locked)
- $38 [Samson That I have right now](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LBSEQS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 
- $49 CAD Audio MH210 45mm (rotates vertically)
- $37 Superlux HD-681 (reviews aren't ideal)
- $40 Superlux HD-681 EVO (detachable cable, white or black)
- $40 Superlux HD668B 

These headphones work pretty well:


Here are some other options that might meet my needs:
- LyxPro HAS-10
- AKG K240STUDIO (these look yummy)
- Audio-Technica ATH-M20x

## Monitors ##
Computer speakers work ok.

- Instead of headphones mount small stereo speakers on tall speaker stands to my left and right, or just one stereo bar speaker.

### Quotes ###
- Zoom G1x Four I learned some amazing things: 1. The clean tones with a compressor or two are really really good.  Best I've had in my living room. 2.  Only 5 blocks including cabinet and wah so if you want to use this into headphones with wah you've only got three blocks. 3. The headphone out is tricky!  If you look on the back you will find the headphone out, plug into it, hear some sound but it will be VERY quiet.  Well you've accidentally plugged into the aux-in (we all did it once dont feel bad). Unless you got a flashlight out and investigated or had remembered from som ewell lit pics online you wouldn't have noticed.  Ist super light.  It doesnt need batteries or a fancy power supply because it can be powered from pretty much any android phone charger!  Online patch sharing is a mixed bag.  some are downloadable but for some reason use non-existant instruments, some dont work at all, others require some third party software, g1 four patches don't work entirely interchangeably with g1x four, even though they are generally adaptable (the exp pedal is the only difference I know of), However with all that said about patches, its really really easy to dial them in yourself.  There aren't many blocks possible soo it takes only 2 minutes to do a patch. The computer software is really good and lets you save and load patches and input new ones and activate the tuner (the looper and drums are probably the only things that arent settable by the software).  Looper Volumes and patches: well there is a problem: when you turn on the looper it records whatever you play and then plays it back at the same volume through the patch you are on right then.  This means that whatever else you play will get lost in the mix, unless you have volume pedal down for the rhythm, or turn guitar volume down if that tone works for you.  The drums stay pretty loud regardless.  There may be an assignable looper pedal which gets around this but if there is then it uses one of your precious blocks.     Another problem: When you turn on the looper it takes about 1s to display an animation that says the word LOOPER.  Thats cute.  But when you are not in the looper but you have a loop going and you want to stop the loop because it has gotten so damn annoying and you get back to the looper to hit stop you have to wait for it and its infuriating.  at least if the looper is playing it should instantly take you to the looper screen, or if necessary display the logo but at least activate the stop and clear button when the logo is displaying its fun animation.  
- AxeFX2 "I have had a number of guitar amp modellers - line 6, eleven rack, software etc. back then, guitar recordings were always a chore, and never, ever a great sound. I rarely played guitar for enjoyment - just played because I was recording a song.  Now - I have the axe fx. I find myself sitting in the studio four hours on end, playing guitar...just for fun. I try a sound and it gives me an idea, and I play....all of a sudden, the sun is coming up! I've had the axe fx ii for over a year now and the unit, fractals support and customer focus is light years ahead of anything out there. I cannot say it strongly enough - you may be partially happy with other units, but the axe fx gives you ideas and motivates you to play."
- AxeFX2 "There is no alternative!  There are however devices one can settle on but you will never be totally happy and always wonder what it would have been like to have the real thing"
- Kemper Full 30s looper in pedalboard making it fully functional, use Michael Britt profiles
- To get Kemper profiles:  In addition to Michael Britt there's a great rundown at just before 5min in this video: https://youtu.be/bHtV4YbBWSU
- Kemper [how to use the Kemper](https://youtu.be/GBvOP-29yCw) "Kemper has more of an amp-y quality to it."  "Its like pulling into a warehouse full of thousands of amps and cabinets and you can just find the one you want, plug into it, and go" 
- AxeFX3 "This sounds more like a  pristene clean, they sound more like what you would get in the studio when you've compressed and EQd them to fit into a mix better"
- In [this comparison between AxeFX and Kemper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBvOP-29yCw) I preferred the AxeFX 
- Amplifire [How to dial in a tone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5sXy23PT8s)
- Amplifire "Amplifire takes pedals very well, and Marc Gallo has confirmed he spent a lot of time getting this right"
- Iridium "I have already used the Iridium on stage. I set nearly everything between 11 and 1 o'clock and just let her rip. It sounded fantastic! It has to be one of the most idiot-proof digital setups out there."
- Trick to simulate dual amps on the AxeFX FM3 "First, a quick note - the bass player in my main band often used a Fishman bass pedal that could produce an octave + fifth signal to a separate output and we'd run that into a Tech 21 Plexi pedal and later an Atomic Amplifirebox. Then he got an HX stomp and we created a single patch with a pitch block and two amp blocks to do the same thing. The reason for this is that we have usually just been a 1 guitar band and he would kick in the faux guitar during solos when the bass is pumping 8ths or something similar. So I wanted to do the same thing with the FM3. But there's just one amp block and I use that for an SVT amp. And there's just one cab block that has a matching 8x10 IR. The solution for the Amp block in my case was to use a Tube Drive (I think I ended up with the 3-knob version). For the cab block, there's two ways I could have done this. Take advantage of the fact that the cab block is stereo and you can use two IRs. Pan the SVT hard left and Pan the Tube Drive hard right - then adjust the balance in the cab block (this happens after the IR have been applied. Use a technique that @FractalAudio shared a while back that uses a filter and a parametric EQ to do a faux cabinet. I'm guessing it's a similar approach to what something like a Palmer PDI-09 does.  The filter and EQ uses less CPU and it's already being fed a very dramatically pitch-shifted signal so it's not exactly going to sound like a real guitar anyhow.  With the faux guitar and amp mixed just enough to be heard but not dominant, the end result is actually pretty good in a live mix - obviously this isn't something you'd do if you were recording.  So the tl;dr reason I shared this, is that you may be able to do a similar thing with the FM3 to produce your sound. Run the lows through an SVT amp/cab block and then run the highs into a Tube drive with either the filter or stereo cab technique. Since you're using a 5150, I'd use the 4-knob tube drive - it has a lot of gain on tap.  How do you split your highs/lows? Crossover? Low/high pass filters? Or?"

## Working with a Modeler ampsim ##
[How to make your Helix or Kemper FEEL like the real thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J02heFTwEXY&t=483s)
1. Stick a subtle compressor at the end of the chain to simulate natural tube poweramp compression. "This is more of a feel thing than a tone thing"
2. We always perceive more volume as sounding better
3. Use [subtractive EQ](https://youtu.be/J02heFTwEXY?t=609) to affect the sound after the amp and cab but before the delay and reverb
4. Use a bit of soft clipping (subtle distortion) after amp and cab to simulate speaker and poweramp breakup
5. Working with the amplifire [dialing in a tone in the amplifire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5sXy23PT8s)



## Channel Switch Lag ##
"The Diezel D-Moll doesn't have this drop issue, but it does have a little bit of a time lag when kicking in the channel change, and a bigger time lag when kicking in the fx loop. Can't speak for their other models."

"The Sig X is pretty much instantaneous across all modes."

"The Laney VH100r is instantaneous across all modes."

"The Satriani JVM is pretty much instantaneous across all modes.
Vanilla JVM definitely does it, I measure it once, about 50ms silence between changes."

Blackstar HT dont have this.  Chappers shows it off in his demo of the one and 5

[multiwatt dual rec has the problem](https://www.thefretboard.co.uk/discussion/27836/channel-switch-lag-problem).  pre multi watt doesnt but the switches eventually fail

"-You can't change between the distortion, heavy distortion, and clean settings within an amp bank. This means that in order to change between distortion and clean, you have to change between banks, and unfortunately, there is a brief pause while the VYPYR changes over. This isn't so bad for sitting at home, writing songs, but it is terrible for anything quick and on-the-go."

# Attenuators and Speaker Sims and Cab Sims #
If you power up a traditional tube amp, and pull out the speaker cable, you can destroy your tube amp because a tube power section requires the resistance provided by the speaker.  You or an amp manufacturer can use an 'attenuator' or 'dummy load' to electrically take the place of a speaker.  'Attenuation' is an electrical term which in physics means 'a loss of intensity' so an attenuator lowers the intensity of the amps signal and can provide the resistance necessary to run the amp quietly or silently while not burning out the power section of a tube power amp.  Typically the attenuator will have a line level signal coming out of it which is the same as the signal that was going to go to the speaker only quieter.  This works just fine electrically however there are two caveats: 
1.  Each speaker (and cabinet) has its own characteristics which add color to the sound.  The sound you would have heard out of the speaker will be inherently different than the sound you will hear from the line out since the line out will not have been affected by the characteristics of the speaker (some say the speaker and cab are 50% of your tone).  The simple solution to this is to plug the line out into something called a 'speaker sim' aka 'cabinet sim' aka 'cab sim' which will simulate the color of some speaker and or speaker cabinet. 
2.  When the signal exits the power amp the speaker doesnt merely accept it and play the signal, the speakers resistance pushes back against the power amp to varying degrees such that the power amp has to push the sound into and through the speaker and receives impulse responses back from the speaker and some of the valueable tones we hear when playing a tube amp are a result of the interactions between the power amp and the speaker.  The responses actually improve the tone and simulating those impulse responses is a part of the latest attentuators and the best sounding speaker simulators.

- This [video of Pat Quilter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAEdc1l-t6g) shows with an oscilliscope the difference between using an actual speaker and a dummy (resistive) load.

4. "The little known fact about ZOOM products is their super low noise floor. (-102 dB!) Noise is the enemy of music.  Yes, noise gates help, especially on those ridiculously distorted and processed metal sounds that all our inner children embrace. But you will need LESS noise gating when you build from a clean low floor. Less gating = more realistic response + better tones.  Another fact about ZOOM: they have very fast processors and high-quality converters. Any digital audio can only be as good as the converters: both A to D and D to A. No matter how good the translation from A to D and back again, unless you have the processing speed, there will be artifacts: glitches, aliasing, phase decoherence. Those artifacts are particularly nasty when a stereo signal is summed to mono, as many players do.  ZOOM processors are purpose-built for audio, unlike many other LINEs who use cheap off-the-shelf generic processors in their entry level products. The ENTIRE ZOOM line uses the same quality converters and processors, even in their least expensive models.   ZOOM keeps prices low by purchasing a Zillion high-quality processors for the entire line, instead of using cheap chips in cheap pedals.  In general, all zoom audio stuff is high-quality, regardless of price-point. Super low noise. Super fast processors. Few if any artifacts. And they all sum to mono beautifully. Obviously the best way to use any effect is in stereo, but not every gig justifies carrying the extra gear. So that summing feature is CRUCIAL. "



## FX Loop Attenuators ##
Find new tones and dial in more usable tones, zero has no volume but 1 or 2 is MUCH too loud expands your amps range of volume.
1. Carls Custom Volume Box $24 (FX Loop Attenuator)
2. JHS Little Black Box $45 (FX Loop Attenuator)


## Impedances ##
1. Speakers: 4-16 Ohms
2. Headphones: 25-300 Ohms
3. DJ Headphones: 27-70 Ohms

Headphones with low impedance (<25Ohms) require little power to deliver high audio levels however are more susceptable to blowouts when using more powerful amplifiers.  Headphones with higher impedance demand more power to deliver high audio levels but as a result are protected from damage from overloading.

- "I have the ampli firebox nd was considering the Iridium until I bought some OwnHammer IRs.  The OwnHammer's sound WAY better than the stock Atomic IRs. Also, I thought a single cab/speaker IR was just that...a single IR...but no. They are so many different types of mic choices and mic placements that come with a single $7.99 purchase. I didn't count, but I'd guess around 40-50 different choices in the zip file.  I'm no expert, but to me the Ownhammer's are way less "woofy"? and the pick attack sounds much more natural. I know, sounds can be hard to explain."
- Beyerdynamic by signing up to a list https://youtu.be/pTLu6HpBFBA&t=300s
- "PSA: If you prefer the sound of one of these over the others, it's almost certainly the IRs you prefer. Don't buy IR loaders on sound. Buy for the features that you need, and then get some Ownhammer IRs and sound spectacular regardless."
- "I agree that changing the IRs in the Amplifire makes a big difference. They are stock matched cabs in this video, but when I've recorded and gigged with the AA3 I've used third party cabs, usually Michael Britt's."
- "Saw a clip today of the Axe II, Amplifire and Zoom G3n doing Plexi tones. Once the same OwnHammer impulse was added, they all sound spot on to each other" [AXEFX vs Amplifire vs Zoom G3x](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtZlAzVQ7EE)

1. Boss Katana: Boss Tone Studio for Katana works on Macos 11.2.2 (Confirmed on my mac).  Drivers for katana last updated in Dec 2019.  
1. Boss GT001: last updated 2017, officially supported only up to OS10.15 Confirmed to work on my mac.  Drivers seemed to install just fine (when allowed permissions)
1. Boss GT1000Core: Last updated Oct2020, M1 macs not yet supported
1. Zoom: Zoom software (at least for the gce3) works on mac.  Confirmed on my mac.    
10. Blackstar: id:Core and:series have great software but its based on microsoft silverlight so doesnt and wont work on mac :( I tried installing it on my mac and after forcing me to install mono several times (and i already had it installed) and restarting it still wouldnt install the actual software.  
1. Fender Mustang: Fender Tone software works on mac Big sur.  
10. Vox VT doesnt have usb recording.  Tone Librarian software doesnt work on Big Sur :( (tested - it has 0 on its icon and wont run
1. Comments: It seems like most of these neglect to update their software for their older units but I dont exactly blame them since many of their customers (windows users) wont have the same set of problems.  Most of them that have mac compat at least have it compatible with the latest OS for their latest products.  Blackstar seems to be the exception here.

Run Rocksmith and turn off your guitar sound in the mixer. Choose preset in nux or make your own sound - and play rocksmith. And thats all! Nux is mixing rocksmith output with fx tone in stereo, all feutures in rocksmith 100% working, great sound modelling with impulse response, no latency problem!"

# Pedals #


### MIDI Footswitch ###
- Some FX Units can respond to midi signals and if they can I can make my own Footswitch that uses MIDI over USB or just MIDI to do anything I want!   
- [The first clue about using a home made midi footswitch with Zoom MS50G](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/99bv2d/question_looking_for_a_good_tube_amp_for_bedroom/e4mnaag/)
- Behringer MIDI Foot Controller FCB1010 "If you get the chip, make sure you specify the version with smooth CCs on the pedals. The original behringer software is very crude at the bottom of the pedal travel. The regular UNO emulates this - but there is an UNO version that 'corrects' this nonsense and supplies a nice smooth CC output from bottom to top." This can apparently work pretty well with the Kemper. Behringer MidiPedalboard with Uno for Kemper can work too for cheaper.
- For HX Stomp check out [this MIDI Pedal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db6JQp46QYI)

## Other Cool Pedals##
- TC Electronic MIMIQ $60-120 (Double or Triple Track your Guitar sound, stereo ) 
- Keely 30ms Double Tracker (reverb stereo chorus and doubletracking)
- EHX Freeze (lets you sustain a note) [Tricks to use this pedal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjFth1mg5Rc)
- keyztone exchanger pickup sim
- EHX Knockout for pickup sim or eq


## Ambiance ##
- Boss RV3 Reverb + Delay
- Any small FX pedal would have these two FX in it

## Drums ##
- Digitech Trio (whole band in a pedal)


## Cool pedal companies ##
- Wampler (love the pedals, intolerance)
- JHS pedal products have my respect
- Baroni-Lab
- AMT


# Loopers #
- My Zoom device works as a looper!
- $70 VSN Twin Looper Electric - Most of same features as the nux but 2 buttons BUT only 10min of loop rather than 8hrs.  looks simpler honestly.  no drums.
- $199 Ditto x2 Looper ($130 used) (5min, unlimited undo/redo, 2 buttons, half speed playback, USB for load save (at least it will let you load backing tracks onto it))
- $199 Boss RC3 (3h, 99 locations, usb, drum patterns, problems transferring files?)
- $199 Boss RC5 (USB for wavs, 99 phrases, external control, 13h, )
- $308 Boss RC10r (6hrs, 280 drum presets, 16kits, midi, option for 100% analog signal, 99 phrases, 2 tracks, 2 external controls)
- -----------------
- Boss RC1 Loop Station (can use with external 2 button footswitch, 12min, stereo, USB for wave upload download)
- $99 Donner New Circle Looper with drum machine (save loops for later, can sync with drum track (remember which one per loop), ) (out of stock)
- $99 Nux Loopcore - Strange reviews that concern me, usb, speed up slow down loops, drum machine, 8hrs, only one button - but 2 button Footswitch!!!  Might work well just as a recorder honestly ...
- Elecroharmonix
- NO TC Wiretap Riff Recorder (Sync with iphone, 8hrs on pedal, tap to record) (bought and it was a mess)
- "If I could travel backward in time to meet my younger self... I'd bring a Ditto Looper and say, 'Practice with this pedal. It will help your playing enormously, and you'll have a great time." - Paul Gilbert
- $350 Digitech Trio+ Band Creator (3 button external footswitch (TRS)) (older version discontinued)
- $130 Ditto+ one button so I dont want it but ... this plus version has usb to upload and also has dynamic loop length 
- ------------------
- Jam Man solo xt ('I have a jam man solo xt with aux in and it converts aux in to mono.")
- $700 Headrush Loopboard
- Pigtronix Infinity
- $200 Used Line6 JM4 Looper (4 loops?)
- $200 Used Ditto X4 Looper
- EHX Memory Box
- $100 used Digitech SDrum (not a looper but drums)

More loopers are [listed here](https://musiccritic.com/equipment/pedals/looper-pedals/) 


# Expression Pedals #

I want a cool Pressure pedal.  To do this I need polarity switch and also continuous input, aka half-damper aka half-pedaling.  If I need to I could buy or build a polarity reversing adapter.  I could like get a splitter stereo to dual mono LR, then couplers, then another splitter/combiner and just swap them ...
- Roland DP10 $50 has continuous input which apparently means you can use it as an expression pedal.  I want to try that
- KorgDS1h $55 has half-damper ... its got a trs cable which I didnt think it would
- -----
- Yamaha fc3a $40 (reviews indicate that there isn't usable travel between on and off, yes its continuous but dont even think about going halfway or 1/4 thats one reviewer anyway)

Notes: "It appears this is a simple on/off switch pedal. For continuous or gradient performance the phrases to look for in sustain pedal description are "half-damper" or "half-pedaling." If there is no indication by the manufacturer of one of those descriptions, the pedal is just an on/off switch. If your digital piano or elec... see more"
Note for polarity reversing trick (which I dont think will work with guitar fx but hey) "If a sustain pedal plugged into a Yamaha keyboard is producing the opposite effect - sustaining when the pedal is not depressed, and not sustaining when it is depressed - it's usually because (a) the pedal was plugged in while the keyboard was turned on, or (b) the pedal was depressed while the unit was powering on. This tricks the keyboard into thinking the default state of the pedal is depressed, resulting in a reverse polarity or reverse function. There's an easy way to remedy this: 1) With the unit turned on and the sustain pedal plugged in, depress and hold the sustain pedal while you power the unit off.2) Release the sustain pedal once the unit has been turned off.3) Turn the unit back on."

Note Polarity is also known as latch/unlatch and some keyboards (roland ) have a latch unlatch settign built intto the kb.
Note For the korg "Notice the Korg website has a new driver "Korg Kontrol Editor", which allows for software-based polarity switching. However, I found that this pedal work perfectly right out of the box. Notice the Korg website has a new driver "Korg Kontrol Editor", which allows for software-based polarity switching. However, I found that this pedal work perfectly right out of the box."

# Shelves #
Ideally 19.5Wx10Hx12D


### Needs ###
Would like the top shelf to be 40-44" tall so I can tweak that one and the ones below it too
< 22" wide to fit in the closet door
Ideally <10"deep to fit just in front of my other amp and still close the closet door

Closet is probably 24" across, but the door opening would clear 22" just barely

## Shelves I bought ##
4 shelves
Could accomodate 19.5Wx10Hx12D


|-----4-----|
|10H		|
|19.5W		|
|-----3-----|
|10H		|
|19.5W		|
|-----2-----|
|11.5H		|
|19.5W		|
|-----1-----|

6" Deep for 1 shelf
12.5" Deep for both together

19.5W is within the current boundaries.  With heavy modifications could support up to 21".  Could possibly flip shelves to make more height 



### How wide are they so far ###
How wide are the amps that I want on this thing?
How deep are they?

#### Medium Sized Heads ####
NOFIT Morgan MVP23 20Wx10Dx10H
NOFIT Bassbreaker 15 is 19.6Wx9Dx10H
FIT!! Blackstar HT5RH  17.4Wx9Hx9D 
FIT!! Superchamp X2 is 17.5Wx9Dx8H


#### Small Heads ####
FIT!! Laney L5 Studio 16Wx8Dx8H
FIT!! VHT Special 6 head 15Wx8Dx9.5H
FIT!! Peavey Classic 20 mini 14Wx8Dx8H
FIT!! H&K Tubemeister 18 14Wx6Dx6H
FIT!! Blackstar HT1RH 13Wx8Dx8H
FIT!! EVH 5150 III Lunchbox 13Wx7Dx7H
FIT!! H&K Tubemeister 5 10Wx6Hx6D
FIT!! Mooer Little Monster 8Wx5Dx5H

#### Tiny Heads ####
Could fit 2-4 of these on one shelf!
FIT!! Micro Terror 7Wx4Dx6H
FIT!! Micro Dark 7Wx4Dx6H
FIT!! Joyo 6.4Wx4.3Dx5.5H
FIT!! Mooer LIttle Monster 7.4Wx4Dx4H




Most will fit in 20W
Most will fit in 10H (not VHT or Blackstar)
Most will fit in 10D (not Morgan or VHT)


Ideally 40" Tall x 20" Wide x 10" deep with 12" between shelves 

- This one is 22 Wide x 42 High x 6 deep which isnt deep enough unless I strapped them on.  The top shelf is really more like 37" tall and it seems like it would tip over pretty easily, but I really like it though because it would be so easy to put away [This one](https://www.amazon.com/4-Tier-Kitchen-Storage-Cupboard-Casters/dp/B01KUZLAY4/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=rolling+kitchen+shelves&qid=1565147962&s=gateway&sr=8-8)
    - I could get two of them and tie them together to make them deeper and more stable!?!
- This one is 17 Wide x 41 High x 10 deep which seems perfect, but the top shelf is really more like 37" tall and plus has more shelves than I need and not enough space in between so I would have to remove some [This one](https://www.amazon.com/Cozzine-Lockable-Organizer-Shelving-Bathroom/dp/B07CQFR9BN/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=rolling+kitchen+shelves&qid=1565147962&s=gateway&sr=8-7)

# Power Cables Adapters #
Center is the same as Tip
Center Negative = Tip Negative

## What do I want in a power cable? ##
5. 9V
6. 5.5x2.1mm tip
3. Center Negative
4. 1A-2A
1. 6ft+ cable
2. Lots of amazon reviews
7. <$15

One Amp is important for some select pedals (Behringer) but most only require 300mA so that 0.5A will do.

THe Zoom needs Center Negative 9V

Most if not all 9V power supplies have the same tip.

These pedals seem to have the same adapters as Casio AD-5 
Casio SA-46 has center positive but otherwise the same

### Options ###
1. [$10.89, 9V, High Ratings, .8-1A, Tip Negative, 10ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DXF97BR/) The plug on this one looks wrong, but all of my research says it isn't [Same Device but more expensive and specific to the FX](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DND9Y1D)
2. [12.99, 9V, Few Ratings, 1.0A, Tip Negative, 6ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QC6L35G) This one seems really high quality
3. [$19.95, 9V, High Ratings, 2A, Tip Negative, 10Ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003OCLKP0) This one is not a wall wart so seems of the highest quality.  dont know what Amps though but since its got a big block its probably high amps?  [More Info about this at Amazon UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0077CZSZ6)
4. [12.99, 9V, Highest, 1A, Tip Negative, 6.5ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7FCC3P/) This looks like the finest cable with the best ratings.  
4. [$14.99, 9V, High Ratings, 1.0A, Tip Negative, 4-10ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KVT1DMQ/) This one has extensions for 8 devices

#### Runners up for various reasons ####
1. [$7.39,  9V, High Ratings, 0.5A, Tip Negative, 6.0ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00191WVF6)
2. [$7.99,  9V, High Ratings, .85A, Tip Negative, 6.6ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07234PV7Q)
3. [$6.99,  9V, Few  Ratings, 2.0A, Tip Negative, 3.3ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Z4Z32H1)

5. [$12.96, 9V, Few  Ratings, 1.0A, Unknown,         8ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JX4WPLG)
4. [12.49, 9V, No Ratings, 1.0A, Tip Negative, 6ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PLS3RHP) Probably the same device as the $10.89 one above.  Not Prime.
3. [$8.98, 9V, Few Ratings, 1.0A, Tip Negative, 6ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WJPXKNI) No amazon prime and it seems cheap


## Power ##
USB Power technically works, but its super noisy no matter how I arrange batteries or whatever.
1. $30 Donner Power Supply 
2. $50 Dunlop DC Brick
3. $30 AGPTEK CP-05 new
4. $37 Caline Power CP-04
5. $120 Caline Power CP-06+ Is a battery with isolated supplies!  
6. Rechargeable 9v batteries can also be plugged into a little cable and plugged into the top of the pedal. No noise.  easy replacement and recharging and access.


This thing is a super quiet power supply with noise suppression for audio.  its $50 and comes in 5,9,12,and 15v versions and could help power some power splitters for pedals or just one pedal. 
https://www.amazon.com/iPower-Supply-International-Travel-Adapters/dp/B01GNNXP0Y/ 

On reverb there is a Soul Power Instruments Mobile Power (6 outputs inclued 2 isolated, USB Bus-powered Power Suply) which runs on USB up to 2.5A input usb current and outputs to 4 9v power or 2 isolated one 500mA and one 1000mA
Otehrs like this include Mission Engineering 529 and Mosky Power Statiion Nano
or the Rockboard with 50h of 9v power for 2-3 1A devices.

# What I Want #
Goals: Need to be able to easily get a killer brown sound and a killer warm creamy shimmering clean.

- Small
- Easy to plug in
- Easy to move
- Rechargeable
- Sexy

Possibly Also:
- Tinkerable: Independent of the warm soupy guitar tone of tube amps I really like the idea of tinkering with effects on a two monitor computer workstation and having the sound reflect what I do on my computer.  Probably want to pick the one that has the most presets from other people so I can work with other peoples stuff.
- Multiple amps: I like the idea of running my signal into multiple amps or amp sims.  Possibly for stereo effects, possibly just to create a more complete tone.  See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEgNn469gdg) at about 11 min for a demo of two amps at once and how good it sounds and how much they love it

New Desires
- Lightweight
- Controllable at eye level (not on the floor)
- Few cables (easy to set up)
- Great sounds
- Wah
- Looper Pedal (not too many cables)
- Solid power cable
- Dirty/Clean/Boost from footswitch
- Aux In
- Dual stereo amps with different sounds for amazing tones
- Crystalline Spongy Cleans
- Killer Pinnacle level Brown Sound

Low Baggage Tube Amp
1. Lightweight
2. Low maintenance
3. Super Quiet Bedroom / Phone Speaker / Line out levels
4. Great Warm Tone
5. Not too big
6. Not too many wires
7. Not too many controls
8. Not phone required (optional ok)

Ideal Tube Amp
1. Lightweight
2. Low Maintenance
3. Great Warm Fendery Clean Tone
4. Fits on my shelf (19.5Wx10Hx12D)
5. Headphone out on front
6. <250
7. Instantaneous response (probably means all tube required)
8. Front panel access
9. FX Loop for pedal experiments


Desired Multi FX:
1. Expression Pedal Expansion
2. USB Interface
3. USB Bus Powered
4. Stereo Out
5. Software Controllable
6. Very Small


How to setup a station?  
1. A folding chair, a nice table, several guitar cables running to the ground that can be clipped back onto the table.  
2.. just pick up the expression pedal and looper (zoom?) put them on the ground no cables to plug or anything.
3. A built in power strip with a single long cable that I can easily plug into the wall.
4. Two little speakers mounted on stands.  pc speakers? Mounted Speakerbar at ear height Compromise: 1 bluetooth triangle speaker mounted on a bendable mic stand which sticks up  from the table with all cables routed really well and has power plugged into it already or batteries for the floor devices so no power?

One thing I want to do: 1. a device to play backing tracks so it will plug into a 
headphone amp or little mixer on the desk that the qc also plugs into right before it gets to the speaker
and an easy way to run it out to the speaker.  
(this could be an old phone or ipod touch but it should be built into the rig somehow)
and 


Mar 2 2021
One device with 2 footswitches and an expression pedal.  Looper play/dub, start/stop, Expression for wah.
Footswitches easily put on the floor from a simple table which has the rest of the gear and easily fits in a cabinet.  with a speaker mounted on top of the table
Basically no compromises

Fell in love with the quad cortex.  Probably best to sell literally everything else.





Keep the zoom to be a looper maybe?  Would it work as just a looper and a wah pedal?  


1. Finish adjusting the nice prs action
6. Upload Ownhammer IRs into my cab sim



Simplest 1: 
1 quad cortex.  eq pedal on the desk, great looper and wah that effortlessly move to the ground (maybe a little pedalboard for just those two things)
What looper/wah?  Maybe the zoom that I have with an external expression pedal?  maybe even a sustain pedal? (Some have polarity switches)
Record into my laptop with a simple usb cable from the qc



Simplest 3:
Guitar -> s2 button Looper (zoom?) -> ABY -> L into pinnacle -> tube amp -> IR Cab Sim -> triangle speaker
d										 -> R into vypyr ->
d 								  





Roland DP10 as an external expression pedal


Next:
- ----------------------
- Get a good looper (decision fatigue) (Start with my zoom)
- Get a table to work on
- Get an ABY Pedal for going stereo



Mar 12

Simplest Options

I had preordered the new HXStompEX or whatever because it seemed to be the lowest baggage possible thing, however then I learned that garageband can do amps and cabs and plugins so ... I bought a cable.  That would be the super lowest baggage thing.
I cancelled the HXStomp.  The only thing about it was it wasnt uhh wah pedal.

Vypyr

I'm falling back in love with the peavey VYPYR.  the VIP1 has a built in USB interface and sounds so damn good recorded into garage band.  Its got quirks (pans hard left when you change fx lol)  And its got that footswitch  with 4 buttons and expression (and you can even get a huge footswitch with two expressions).  WHOA Apparentlyy the vypyr 30 also has USB record out!
I'm having more fun using garageband as a looper actually and its super easy to lay back on my couch with wireless trackball and keyboard.

 I like the Peavey Vypyr and I like that its like permanent and wont fall over and is super stable like that, and I've got a wah (Well when I have the fx set there anyway) however ... the options are limited, the looper doesnt work on teh 30 but its got all of the options but its 
1. Vypyr VIP1 (limited fx options, a little bit of noise (annoying), clumsy with the LR, support is limited, not really kept up to date, software is limited and untrustworthy ) (wah, already here, love the tone, it really sings, noise is not problematic. super lightweight, not as stable as the 30, USB Recording)
1. Vypyr 30 (heavy, big, wah firmware problem burned me a little, support is limited, not really kept up to date, software is limited and untrustworthy,) (stable and solid as a rock, lots of fx options, wah, USB recording out)
1. Zoom ((doesnt sing in high gain as much as the vypyr the wayy its currently set), not enuogh fx options) (super light, great clean, really good high gain, lots of FX options, can be used with the software )
1. ------
1. I like the idea of having a super lightweight device on the floor with an easy power plug and solid USB interface and all wiring easy to plug in and with very low noise.
1. I like the idea of having super low noise rig no matter what
1. I like the idea of having controls over the guitar fx controllable from the computer


1. Amp with built in interface and clear cabling and laptop controllable (MAC) and wah
	1. $149 Fender Mustang LT25 (No wah, mac compatible?, )
	2. $349 Boss Katana Head
	2. $249 Boss Katana 50 26lbs
#Dude
	3. $129 Blackstar ID:core 10 (Sends DI signal too!  can re-amp later, no mac software)
	4. $799 Yamaha dual head?
1. Just a somehow super quiet interface and plugins
	1. Might have to test a bunch.
	1. Might have to pay $600 (at that point I could get the helix)
1. Floor modeller with wah and clear cabling and laptop controllable (MAC)
	1. $150 NuX MG300 (reamp or dry out, wah, software works with mac) (yes)

Do not need
1. Looper
2. Footswitches

Want
Downloadable Amp Profiles sounds like tons of fun
At least downloadable presets sounds like fun

1. Vypyr not laptop controllable but I could setup presets and switch with the footswitch and use wah that way and that would be all I need

Dont care so much about:
1. Looper
1. Footswitches
1. Cost


Require:
1. Compatible with Mac Big Sur
1. USB audio interface
1. Dual Amp

Desire:
1. 4 channel audio interface 
1. dry signal on audio interface
1. Wah
1. Super Quiet audio interface so I can use high gain plugins


Possible Form Factors:
1. Tiny size to be able to mount on desk with laptop
1. Medium Size desktop or floor, eye level on rolling rack, easy button presses
1. Small-medium amp size so it will never tip
1. Small floor processor with built in wah but controllable from the computer
1. Super lightweight amp size so I can easily carry it around


Ideals
1. Compatible with M1 macs (or likely will soon)

Yesterday I made a spreadsheet that is helping me get this all through my head

1. I like the idea of having two different small amps in parallel into an interface or two interfaces: one which has clear clickable presets (vypyr perhaps?) and ideally another which has a cool mac software configuration.
	1. Advantages: It would be a super clear and solid and low baggage solution from an investment perspective.  They are easily replaceable and not that valuable so I can ditch them if necessary.
	2. Disadvantages: I would be tethered to that spot for recording (maybe thats ok since there aren't like lots of places to go in here anyway). 
2. I like the idea of having two tiny under desk sized amps like headphone amps and running them in parallel
	1. Advantages:  Almost zero investment baggage.  Could get cool tones.  
	2. Disadvantages: Kind of a clumsy arrangement.  Preset synchronization done manually.  
3. I like the idea of having just one device and selling everything else
	1. Advantages: Lowest possible baggage
	2. Disadvantages: Cost.  Not sure which one since there are disadvantages to each.  
4. I like the idea of using the amps I have here in parallel
	1. Advantages: No cost.  Start today (almost).  Fantastic tones and responsiveness.
	2. Disadvantages: Complexity of setup.  Inflexibility of setup.  
5. I like the idea of several amps or amp sims on a rack or table or floor
	1. Advantages: Loads of flexibility.  Relatively low baggage.
	2. Disadvantages: Cable baggage.  Complexity of interface.  
	
Start with $300 for an interface and $100 for an ABY
- $900-1200 Option: (Atomic Amplifire or BluGuitar Amp1 or H&K Tube amp or Laney IRT Pulse) in parallel with both into an interface (Boss GT001)
- $100 for accessories for hooking up (Vypyr VIP1, Vypyr 30, Cube 30, H&K Tube, Zoom G1xfour, Pinnacle, Cab Sim, HotTone Eagles Heart, Joyo American Sound, Behringer Vintage monster)
- $150 for (Vypyr VIP1, Vypyr 30, Cube 30, Mustang, Blackstar )
