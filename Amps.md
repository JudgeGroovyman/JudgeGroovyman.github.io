Quotes

- Piranha - [Hey talks about quality amps having a harmonic ringing and this one does](https://youtu.be/2TTDflrZwKM?t=394) he gets harmonic overtones in his headphones because it adds a harmonic character that is really only found in the old classic fenders and vox amps.  14m0s:'They're ringing like a bell'
- Piranha - high gain tone is good, combined with another amp its good, Reviews aren't universally complimentary
- Micro Dark "what if I tried using the effects loop on the Micro Dark amp...so I ran the send output to the input of the pedal board, and the output of the pedal board to the return input on the MD...HUGE DIFFERENCE !! The effects all sound soooo much better and the guitar has it's nice clean tone back minus the distortion !! ... I just not enjoying it, I'm loving it !! The Micro Dark with the G12T-75 Celestion speaker in the Marshall cabinet has taken over my home studio. I'm getting so many great tones, at all volume levels. Great distortions, great cleans...sounds great at very low volume too !! This set up is just working out so well for me, and now the effect pedals I have sound better than ever. "
- Mark 5 "The Mark V head is brilliant, but there's almost too many options. I can get such good cleans with reverb I sold my Silverface Princeton Reverb, the only thing I miss is the bias trem. Does it sound exactly BF clean? No. But it sounds great, and it gets tones from the other channel a SF/BF Fender never will. Plus the footswitchable contour control works good - set it on noon, at gig volumes you get singing sustain on the edge of controllable feedback. I can use it in my old-fashioned dance band with my 335 and Gretsch, or the modern band with PRS Custom and Strat. It does everything with the 2-mode channels, and you only need to tweak gain and treble slightly - if you're au fait with the Boogie 'set the gain and treble right' it' childsplay getting good tones. "

Other Options
1. Any regular tube amp with a tube preamp stage and FX loop and just run that preamp signal out to an amp sim pedal or speaker emulator or IR Power Amp Simulator or something and experiment to figure out what sounds good. (this is pretty high baggage)
2. Attenuator between the power amp and speaker of a regular tube amp (this is pretty high baggage) (See attenuator section)
3. Tube Headphone Amp
4. Tube Preamp
5. Tube Amp Sim Pedal or FX

### Quotes ###
- 6505/5150 "Also, the effects loop has a poorly-designed buffer that robs all your low-end and adds fizz whenever you're using the loop (it even does this if you simply run a patch cable from send to return.) Eventually, you'll want to use the loop for delay, reverb, etc. It is a very simple fix, but you've got to be somewhat proficient with a soldering iron. It involves soldering a capacitor to the legs of a resistor just behind the effects loop "send" jack. Peavey endorses this fix. Anyway, it took me about 10 minutes to do it, and the sound is now the same whether the effects loop is used or not.   The big reason to do that is so you can run an EQ pedal in the effects loop. That is the most important upgrade to any 5150/6505, IMO. If you thought the amp crushed before doing so -- wait until you try it with an EQ."
- "for heads the H and K clean tone is beautiful. Crystal clear and the little 5 watt head isnt too pricey and will give you bedroom cleans. the Blackstar stuff is probably also worth a look. ... HT 5 Clean I like, think the cleans on the Hughes and Kettner if you are using it as a dedicated clean amp are better than blackstars though" [Rob Chapman Forum](https://www.robchapman.tv/forum/threads/best-small-tube-head-for-clean-tone.33759/page-2)
- "If you like the sound of a Fender champ then you'll love the cleans of the VHT Special 6. The cleans are nothing like a Fender tweed. The cleans are more like a BF champ, on steroids. The Special 6 is a bit on the bright side but manageable. These amps also take OD pedals very well."  [Convince me to buy a VHT](https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/vht-special-6-cleans.1324893/))
- For the VHT Special 6 [They released the schematic](http://chasingtone.com/yourguitaramp/youramp-reviews/vht-special-6-review/))
- Mesa "I've read many a time that a Mesa Mark I has the best Blackface clean sound out there. Original or reissue in a head" ... "Mesa Boogie specifically the Mark 2A (the best cleans of the Mark Series) Twin like cleans all day, but even tighter/more focused"
- "And I have this to say - NOTHING sounds like a good Twin Reverb with JBL's. ... You say what you say because you've never played a FYD or SMS rackmounted TR preamp into a McIntosh MC50 or Carvin DCM200L into a pair of SSP 1X12 cabs loaded, of course, with JBLs. Not only would they sound quite like a good TR - actually, I'll argue better - but you'd be able to bring them to gigs and use them at any volume level"
- "Morgan RV40 is spectacular, sounds killer through my 4x12 with a H30/V30 too. It's quickly becoming my favorite clean amp"
- "For big power BF cleans, a Showman....for less power a Bandmaster...if you like the Bandmaster but you want something spongier and more compressed still, a Tremolux. Those are the BF era Fender heads with the classic AB/AA763 preamp circuit (same as was used in the Twin Reverb and the Deluxe Reverb). No reverb though. Can't really go wrong with any of 'em if you're looking for classic BF Fender 6L6GC cleans in a head. And they're relatively inexpensive to boot!"
- Bassbreaker: Problem with FX Loop Hum "first run (2017) has a faulty effects loop - both heads and combos .. Any Fender repair will fix the loop with a factor kit, at no charge to you. the fix is quick and at no charge to the consumer. ... the updated ones will have a plastic fx send jack, if it's all metal it has not been updated! "
- Bassbreaker: "If you need an amp that is squeaky squeaky clean for fuzz, od, distortion, you might want to look somewhere else.  ... It is a real rock and roll amplifier.  Its single ended so you can drive it really hard, ... but you will have to master the art of manipulating the guitars volume and tone controls to regulate the amount of gain that you want from the amplifier.  I love playing in that fashion.  I think its liberating going with just a single cable right into an amplifier like this that is really cooking and make it through that show.  " [From Some Love for the Fender Bassbreaker 007](https://youtu.be/sSFWjAnkd5A?t=442)
- Bassbreaker: "To sound bigger with this amp, put the volume at 3 o'clock, the gain at the minimum and use a good fuzz or overdrive pedal for your dirt. "  Thats a good tip for a lot of amps. Volume high, gain low, boosts in front

## Quotes ##
- Super Champ "I've had both and I can assure you, after Fuse adjustment, the X2 is alot better. I don't know why Fender ships the amp with everything on 10 and you have to adj. it out, but it does sound alot better. The bass response is huge compared to the Xd. The XD is a little louder in the low volume range, the X2 takes over in the high volume range. The line out on the X2 is much better too."
- Super Champ "Yes, the X2 amazed me, after changing different cabs models within fuse, how much bass can be had. Fuse is very, very easy. It doesn't require much skill. You can adj. it exclusively for your guitar. That separates the X2 from the Xd."

## Quotes ##
- Quilter "If I ever play solid state.......Quilter or right back to tubes. I am also a bit of a tube snob and my ears tell me Quilter is as close as you will ever get to what tubes can do"
- Quitler "It took the pedals like a dream, it responded to my pick attack and expression like a dream"
- Quilter "if I wasn't so fussy (I am, extremely) I would probably use it for every gig as let's face it, the people listening wouldn't be able to tell the difference"
- Quilter "when the Bravado isn't here I use a Fender BDri as my main gigging amp... well, I used to, as if the Bravado isn't here, from here on in I'll be using the Quilter"
- Piranha & IR: "you could very easily just use the effects loop send straight into your interface. You can get the Two Notes Wall of Sound plugin just by buying one impulse response from them (which I think one of them is around $12) and the WoS plugin gives you the option to add a power-amp section along with the speaker impulse. So you wouldn't lose anything by not using the amp's power section. The 6505 Piranha doesn't require a load, so no harm in not having a cab connected if you wanted to record silently.  So really, armed with the Piranha and WoS, you could probably get an even better sound than I did here. I was just trying to keep it authentic and not color it with additional power amp simulation. " https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvszG5CT7M4
- Piranha & IR "Thanks to your video and advice I started messing around with my amps FX send into my interface and loaded up a tube power amp vst and impulse responses. It sounds great! Why isn't this method talked about more??? I'm using a Blackstar HT Club 50 head straight out of the FX send into my interface, with a dummy 1/4" headphone jack in the return to turn stop sound from coming out of the cab. Silent practicing and recording using a full 50 watt tube amp. It's a dream come true in my situation where micing my 4x12 cab blaring 50 watts isn't possible... lol. With the real amps actual tube preamp sound it gets that "real" feeling even though the power amp and cabinet is being taken care of via plugins. It really still "feels" and sounds like an actual live amp being mic'd up. This is awesome. I" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvszG5CT7M4

## Quotes ##
- Mustang "Try a Mustang III v2 with just a touch of gain on the Fender Super Sonic emulation. You'll never go back to tubes!"
- Mustang Unfortunately FUSE is dead now
- Yamaha THR10X Settings at the end of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLmKK5p9E80)
- Vypyr Sanpera Pedal "you'll notice some people complain that there's a time lag when they switch presets. The switch engages as you're picking up your foot, not as you're stepping down on it. Thus, it will not engage until your foot comes off. Step on it a little early if you must and lift your foot off the second you need the switch to occur. Simple as that!"
- Vypyr Sanpera Pedal "The only thing you might have to do to it is adjust the sensitivity of the expression pedal switches, so you won't have to step so hard on it to engage something like the wah-function. But there's a couple youtube videos on how to do that and they're pretty good. It's not hard, at all. It's more to adjust it according to what works for you, since you don't want it too easy, either."
- Vypyr Sanpera Pedal - Theres a mod to drill the rubber under the Expression pedal to make it softer and make the clicking better.  Theres an official mod to open it up and adjust a screw 1/4 turn on a white plate to make it click easier or harder which looks super easy.  Theres a problem with the looper volume with my amp and apparently when you update the firmware in my amp it fixes that problem.  Making these mods and then setting the amp up with some great presets would be a valuable service.
- Katana "No matter what sneakey amp or whatever knob positions i found it to be fatiguing for my ears. At the end of a 3-4 hour jam my ears and brain were exhausted. Does not happen with my main amp."
- Katana/GT1 "Set the boss GT output to small combo, set the katana amp on clean and as flat as possible, and use the GT as a modeler and effects on one and you'll get killer tones.  ... t/s rep at Boss said that the modeling/effects were the same, but those in the Katana had been tuned to the speaker cabinet"
- Katana Sneaky Amps "Katana's additional amps and effects, (some call sneaky amps) are accessible using the non-boss software KATANAFxFloorBoard."
- Katana not GT100 "I had a Gt100 for a couple years and I could not make amp models work for me all that time, direct to the board or through effects loop return on my amp with cab modeling bypassed. I connected effects loop send of my katana head to the same amps effects return and it was thick, creamy, punchy, alive.. so according to my observations, it's not. Maybe modeling part shares some guts but there is something more going on with Boss now."
- Katana - That Pedal Show during their wet dry videos talk about the inherent tiny delay in the katana and all other digital amps.  Its not noticeable to the ear on its own (note: I believe it is noticeable to the brain and thats 75% of the reason tubes are considered better is their instantaneous response to the fingers) but its noticeable when you get to working in stereo with other non delayed amps
- Blackstar ID:Core "Not gonna lie, this was very frustrating for me, and took quite some time. So try this, open your DAW of choise i personally use reaper. You need ASIO4ALL. Enable ID:Core Amplifier and try both 44.1kHz and 48kHz. I personally set ASIO buffer size to 224 Samples. But this might not work for everyone. Tick 'Always Resample 44.1 - 48kHz' And just see if the crackles gets worse or not. Then just try increasing or deacresing buffer size. When i was trying to fix this i had to find a really percise buffer size that worked for me. And if i change my buffersize just a littlebit i start to get crackles again. So just try changing it by very little."

## Boost ##



- The best explanation of why pedals matter is in [this boost video by Pete Thorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMjXLrFCOuU), especially listen to him rip with and without the pedal at 4:30. 
- NOT Distortion NOT Overdrive
- Actual Preamps: According to [Why You Need A Preamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVbceQGhbdM&t=641) preamp pedals are only the ones which tone shape but stay crystal clean.  Thats interesting but not what follows here, but perhaps it would be beneficial to put one in front of these tones to add definition and clarity.  
- Boost: This might be related to Pete Thorns [Treble Boosters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQFdP6PaKTk) or his [5 Pedals for Boosting your amp Tone Secrets #4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMjXLrFCOuU)
- ART Tube MP (29-$100) (Warms up and preamps any signal, some versions have variable valve voicings)

Amp tweaker for tight drive tube screamer pedal and for the tight metal preamp pedal



### Giving Life ###
There are a class of pedals which boost in just the right way that it makes a clean tone come alive.  These are the kind of pedals that might stay always on and you would really miss if you turned it off.
- EP Boost on 0 ([Talked about in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XGvRAQ0HeA&t=9m45s), also "Ultimate Overdrives Part One")
- Mojo Mojo on 0 Always on Paul Gilbert [Beginning of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5J8R2S3BZw)
- Simble Predriver (Preamp/Booster/Compressor) (Good candidate for an always on magic pedal) [Pete Thorns Review](https://youtu.be/N8zzvVmyzIw?t=117)
- Clover [More about this pedal](https://youtu.be/SVbceQGhbdM?t=203) [real preamp and boost with versatile eq and xlr](https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/report-back-all-analog-ampless-direct-rig-jhs-clover-and-radial-jdx-direct-drive.2035820/#post-28323906)
- BBE Sonic Maximizer (Michael Nielsen shows how critical it is in his Nuno tone video).  He says it is an exciter


### Treble Boosters ###
- "Never played a Rangemaster but I own a Naga Viper ... My Mesa sounds amazing until I hit that pedal, and then its really magical"
- Find them cheap by looking for naga clone or or beano clone or rangemaster clone or treble booster or java boost clone on reverb
- Beano Booster: A Treble Booster pedal. Has to be at the front of your signal chain due to the germanium.  From [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGGiuhukWNo)
- Cali76 is an [overdrive for your clean sound](https://youtu.be/zbvke372TKM) (compression for sustain) 
- Vertex Boost MK1 or MK2
- Nobels OD1 (or its many clones)



## Tone Shaping Preamps ##
Like the preamp section of an amp but in a pedal.  Most of these can feed a poweramp through the fx loop return and make a great sound.

$329 Richie Kotzen Tech21 FlyRig has a sansamp in it so he plays it into a clean tube amp for a small room.  He spent 6 months getting the overdrive right in that thing and he tours with JUST that and plugs into any clean tube amp, ideally one of his victory amps or he used to use marshalls.  HE needs a percussive bite to his tone.

### Quotes ###
- IRT Pulse - [How to setup Pulse on Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueVF52HDNNE) "To set up the Pulse on Macs: You have to create an aggregate I/O using "Audio MIDI Set Up."  You have to use different devices for the inputs and outputs. I used a USB Audio CODEC with two inputs and used my Focusrite as the output.  Whatever you name your new aggregate, insure your DAW is set for it. Heres the Apple support page that shows you how easy it is to create the aggregate.  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202000"
- IRT Pulse - [Great Clean Tones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueVF52HDNNE)
- Preamp Pedals [This Guy](https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/cab-sim-and-preamp-pedals-query.1989739/#post-27546321) shares an interesting perspective on replacing the tube power amp (or in this case not) "The bottom line is the critical tone shaping happens in the preamp and the speaker while a certain dynamic is added by a tube power amp which is really felt when monitoring the guitar amp. Once I start monitoring a miced guitar amp however, there is that reduction to that experience puts the speaker simulation on a nearly level playing field."
- Bulava "just finished my board and tried running a Tech 21 OMG (from an RK5) distortion into the Bulava. It sounded awesome. ... I really like the clean, too."   " thrilled to report that the AMT SS-20 works fantastically well as a pedal platform. Both my Rockett The Dude and MI Audio Crunchbox (only pedals I have lying around at the moment) sound massive through the AMT clean channel into an ADA GCS-3 cab sim"
- AMT Other Pedals F1(Fender) also: B1 (Bogner), R1(Mesa), E2(Engl), D1(Diezel), S1(Soldano), P1(5150), M1(Marshall), C2(Cornford), some are cheaper than others, 
- Ethos "you could always step up to the Ethos, killer clean tone AND a great OD tone as well"
- AMT "the pedal (P1) sounds excellent imo. It feels and sounds like I'm playing through an amp instead of a pedal (it goes through an EHX magnum and a bogner cube). What's also amazing about it is it cleans up real well when you roll your guitar's volume down. If you're thinking about getting the P1, I would go ahead and get the P2 instead. The difference between the 1 series and the 2 series is that the 2 has a clean channel when switched off, but that also makes it a non true bypass. Another downside is the clean has a fixed eq since the eq controls are assigned to the gain channel only. But on the flip side, the clean channel sounds like a nice fender and doesn't really need to be eq'd.  You should also consider the S2 as it sounds like the P1 boosted with a tube screamer - tight. The E1 I don't like much because to my ears it's lacking some low end."
- EHX 2ube "2ube with couple old RCA 12au7 has been my most used pedal for years, actually have 2 of them.   After drives as a dual tube splitter to drive stereo effects after them. You can switch it to line level if your driving FRFR speakers that want line level input or instrument if driving guitar amps. If your running wet/dry you can dial up some extra OD on the dry side if desired.  Or plug your guitar into 2ube 1 then out to your other drive pedals in loop then back to 2ube 2 as output tube buffer. Like this your guitars plugged right into a tube preamp, acts like it too, reacts very dynamically to vol roll offs and pick attack. It's a input buffer with both drive and vol adjustments. Like your cleans with a little hair on them, it can do it on that drive knob then vol knob can reign it in so its not OD input of next pedal.  So many ways you can configure this pedal. I even use it as stereo OD after synths. Old 12au7 and 12ay7 are its mojo tubes, dump the stock 12ax7wb, their awful in this pedal."
- “Would also add the Victory Kraken. Very small amp but still 50 Watts of tube goodness.” “10/10 I agree. The Kraken is a monstrous sounding amp, Gain 1 at 11 oclock, pushed hard with an OD... Bliss.” ... “I've got the kraken 50 watt. It replaced my 5150 ii head . I got tired of lugging half a tonne of tone about, so got the kraken which has got more to offer sonically (opinion) and its just as loud, easy to carry (8kg!!!) and has more than enough gain for some dirt shitting riffs. Cleans are super crisp and jangly. Its and absolute workhorse”
- ADA MP1 Preamp (if the pedal version really works this is the secret to 80s sounds.  Michael Nielsen says in the nuno tone video that its critical to nunos tone and has a great AB test with without the rack version) he says to use preset 45 and gives the settings on screen in the video



#### About the Mesa Boogie VTwin ####
- Apparently [hard to find in great working condition](https://youtu.be/ObrzKKxZaLc?t=225)
- Then again heres a contrary opinion that [they are reliable](https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/mesa-v-twin-praise.516842/)
- [About the V Twin](https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/mesa-v-twin-praise.516842/): "I love mine. I have tried to replace it with a smaller, battery-powered pedal, but without success (Catalinbread SCOD, Fulltone OCD, Keeley Metal Zone, Mad Professor MRD, MI Audio Crunch Box, Subdecay Blackstar, Vox Satchurator, and I forget what else). Everything I have tried, even if it sounds good on its own, pales in comparison to the massive tone of the V-Twin."
- [Not only overdrive]() "I used it not only as a distortion/overdrive generator in front of an amp, but also as a preamp straight into a recording deck."
- "I foolishly sold it when I bought a Mark 1 reissue because I thought I would have the "Mesa sound" covered with that amp."
- "I use one for practice direct to board. The magic ingredient for me is running a TS type pedal in front of it. It really tightens up the sound a lot. I recnt;y tried a few othee OD's in front but the TS is the only one that seems to work."
- "it's warmer and smoother than any Recto I've heard"
- "Its one of the best high gain pedals out. I wish I hadn't sold mine, its was built like a tank!"
- "An Xotic RC Booster sounds very good in front of the V Twin. If you are using humbukers , you can drive the hell out of it. It screams. very thick saturated OD. I like it best in front of a clean amp just on the verge of break up."
- "2 days ago I took it out of the recording setup and plugged it into the power amp junction (under the chassis) of my MBMKIIB combo loaded with Yellow Jackets in Triode mode and an EVM12L. I set the vtwin on the right side channel mode 2 with the gain up about 1/3 to 1/2 way. This gives a slight breakup. Nice warm sound. Push the master up and you start getting into power tube distortion. Sweet. Then I stepped on my OCDv4. Holy #$^& ! Here's the tone I've been searching for all my life. I can't stop playing. I haven't been this inspired in a long time. Turning off the OCD and switching on the BoR gave another inspiring tone. All of the sudden all my pedals sound freakin awesome! I hope the second honeymoon I'm on with the Vtwin never ends.:JAM"
- "The clean channel, however, takes pedals just like a good tube amp, so I mainly use it with headphones, in the wee, small hours before sunrise.."
- "It's that latency issue that really bugs me. I could never get used to that moment of dead silence in a live setting, so it was relegated to the studio"
- "I suse the V Twin for metal. If your un an MXR Six Band Eq after the VTwin you get incredible tone sahping options with a boost in louness, more headroom. Sounds amazing. High gain boogie tones all the way. I also run a Creations Audio Lab MK.4.23 before it, kick it for leads and I get more gain with no sound coloration. "
- "The VTwin is hands down the best Overdrive/Distorion pedal ever built (IMO). Cant understand why Mesa doent make them anymore. Im glad I got one."
- "After all these years and thousands of dollars spent on gear, my V-Twin is still my favorite pedal by far ... I have tried to replace the V-Twin with something smaller and battery powered, but it just cannot be done. Nothing has the massive low end, tone-ful girth, and easy playability of the mighty V-Twin."
- Fix for the delay "there is the irritating sound cutoff when you switch from the v-twin to bypass ... External Bypass switch, the problem is only around when you use the onboard one. Any 1 -button/2 setting footswitchshould work, there's a jack on the backside for it ... so by using the external switcing outputs, theres no sound loss when bypassing? hmm, interesting, thanks!  ... I'm assuming you mean the "dropout" when switching, and yes, an external switch aleviates the problem.  .. now when i switch from the v-twin to bypass, there is no loss in sounds, but vise versa, the sounds cuts out for a second. ... Stick a 1 megaohm resistor between the ground and signal and your set."

#### Behringer Vintage Tube Monster V999 ####
- "I've bought and then sold lots and lots of pedals. ... With the VT-999 this may be as close as I've gotten to a Marshall in a Box tone so I'm pretty pleased. Oh, a tube screamer is icing on the cake to give your tone extra punch."
- "This pedal need bow it's metaphorical head to no one.  this paddle gives you the gain stage of a hot rodded Marshall amplifier. (Tonally) Pick your poison, be it NWOBHM, Ozzy Era Zakk Wylde, Randy Rhoads and dozens of other tones that made heavy metal great. You will find it."
- "If you dial it down, you can play anything, blues to jazz to classic rock, and very low gain settings it serves to fantastically just warm up the signal of a clean guitar"
- "if you're a guitarist just starting out, and you want to distortion pedal that'll do anything you need it to, look no further.  If you're a pro, and you're looking for another color for your Distortion palette, this one deserves a place among the pantheon of the gods.  If you have an amplifier that has a fantastic clean tone but just doesn't bring the fire when it's time to turn up the heat, this one can bring Hell.  I've said a lot, but I still don't feel that I've said enough.  Just buy the damn thing."
- "I wish I had ordered it sooner.  Out of the box this thing is a beast."
- " if you get a noisy one it is not the design, exchange it for a good one. If you get one with a noise problem it is defective. Exchange it for another and you will like it."
- "This pedal literally cracks me up. I've spent upwards of $300 on real tube pedals, and not happy with the tone on most. ... After 10 minutes, I pulled out my box of JJ's ECC83s. Popped that in, and laughed all the way to the fridge for another beer after hearing a nice smooth tube OD!"
- "opens up with 9v center neg 500mV 1A power supply"
- "unless you're after a real saturated metal distortion...a very low gain works best. It'll still OD a lot with a 12AU7, but you get a wider scope of clean to dirt with the low gain tube.  A better 12AX7 gain rating 100% 5751, and exact match to a 12AX7 with a gain rating of 70% 12AT7 gain rating 60% 12AY7 gain rating 45% 12AV7 gain rating 41% 12AU7 gain rating 19%  All of the tubes sounded MUCH better than the stock....but the 12AU7 gave the wide scope of overdrive and a fuller tone that responded the best to the tone controls.  any decent tube from Tung Sol, JJ...etc will work."
- "The build quality is great, but the tube overdrive was missing the bottom end and clear not muddy distortion. So I got an electro Harmonix 12AX7E electron tube and it made a world of a difference!"

# Headphones & Monitors #

Probably worth getting really good headphones in this case.  Personally I want the solid feeling of the headphones being glued to my head and due to my head and my hair many headphones slip right off when I move around at all which makes them unusable for playing guitar so I don't want the ear cups to rotate sideways at all (because they slip off my head) and I don't really want them rotating up and down either.  I also don't want a detachable cable even though thats all the rage these days I realize that its got its practical purposes and that lots of other people want it that way.  I don't like them collapsing or folding since then its one more step to put them on (grabbing with both hands to unfold and pull apart).  If they are too large they will just slip off.

My Needs:
- No rotation
- No collapsing or folding 
- Straight Cable
- Not Detachable Cable
- Ideally over ear
- Not too loose 

See Impedances elsewhere in this note

## Headphone Notes ##
Ideal characteristics 
1. Sexy / Classy
2. Unbelievable shimmery spongy clean tones
3. Speaker Sim Headphone Out
4. Raw Line Out
5. Aux In

### No for various reasons ### 
- $127 Audiotechnica ATH-M50x (Collapsible and foldable)
- $80 Sony MDR7506 (Folding, coiled cable)

### Should work ###
- $134 Beyerdynamic DT-770 (32 Ohm, 80 Ohm, 250 Ohm models)
- $49 Audio-Technica ATH-M20x (Rotate a bit vertically)
- $68 AKG K240STUDIO (Detachable cable? Locked)
- $38 [Samson That I have right now](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LBSEQS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 
- $49 CAD Audio MH210 45mm (rotates vertically)
- $37 Superlux HD-681 (reviews aren't ideal)
- $40 Superlux HD-681 EVO (detachable cable, white or black)
- $40 Superlux HD668B 

These headphones work pretty well:


Here are some other options that might meet my needs:
- LyxPro HAS-10
- AKG K240STUDIO (these look yummy)
- Audio-Technica ATH-M20x

## Monitors ##
Computer speakers work ok.

- Instead of headphones mount small stereo speakers on tall speaker stands to my left and right, or just one stereo bar speaker.

### Quotes ###
- Zoom G1x Four I learned some amazing things: 1. The clean tones with a compressor or two are really really good.  Best I've had in my living room. 2.  Only 5 blocks including cabinet and wah so if you want to use this into headphones with wah you've only got three blocks. 3. The headphone out is tricky!  If you look on the back you will find the headphone out, plug into it, hear some sound but it will be VERY quiet.  Well you've accidentally plugged into the aux-in (we all did it once dont feel bad). Unless you got a flashlight out and investigated or had remembered from som ewell lit pics online you wouldn't have noticed.  Ist super light.  It doesnt need batteries or a fancy power supply because it can be powered from pretty much any android phone charger!  Online patch sharing is a mixed bag.  some are downloadable but for some reason use non-existant instruments, some dont work at all, others require some third party software, g1 four patches don't work entirely interchangeably with g1x four, even though they are generally adaptable (the exp pedal is the only difference I know of), However with all that said about patches, its really really easy to dial them in yourself.  There aren't many blocks possible soo it takes only 2 minutes to do a patch. The computer software is really good and lets you save and load patches and input new ones and activate the tuner (the looper and drums are probably the only things that arent settable by the software).  Looper Volumes and patches: well there is a problem: when you turn on the looper it records whatever you play and then plays it back at the same volume through the patch you are on right then.  This means that whatever else you play will get lost in the mix, unless you have volume pedal down for the rhythm, or turn guitar volume down if that tone works for you.  The drums stay pretty loud regardless.  There may be an assignable looper pedal which gets around this but if there is then it uses one of your precious blocks.     Another problem: When you turn on the looper it takes about 1s to display an animation that says the word LOOPER.  Thats cute.  But when you are not in the looper but you have a loop going and you want to stop the loop because it has gotten so damn annoying and you get back to the looper to hit stop you have to wait for it and its infuriating.  at least if the looper is playing it should instantly take you to the looper screen, or if necessary display the logo but at least activate the stop and clear button when the logo is displaying its fun animation.   Update: There may be a setting to avoid that looper audio problem.  
- AxeFX2 "I have had a number of guitar amp modellers - line 6, eleven rack, software etc. back then, guitar recordings were always a chore, and never, ever a great sound. I rarely played guitar for enjoyment - just played because I was recording a song.  Now - I have the axe fx. I find myself sitting in the studio four hours on end, playing guitar...just for fun. I try a sound and it gives me an idea, and I play....all of a sudden, the sun is coming up! I've had the axe fx ii for over a year now and the unit, fractals support and customer focus is light years ahead of anything out there. I cannot say it strongly enough - you may be partially happy with other units, but the axe fx gives you ideas and motivates you to play."
- AxeFX2 "There is no alternative!  There are however devices one can settle on but you will never be totally happy and always wonder what it would have been like to have the real thing"
- Kemper Full 30s looper in pedalboard making it fully functional, use Michael Britt profiles
- To get Kemper profiles:  In addition to Michael Britt there's a great rundown at just before 5min in this video: https://youtu.be/bHtV4YbBWSU
- Kemper [how to use the Kemper](https://youtu.be/GBvOP-29yCw) "Kemper has more of an amp-y quality to it."  "Its like pulling into a warehouse full of thousands of amps and cabinets and you can just find the one you want, plug into it, and go" 
- AxeFX3 "This sounds more like a  pristene clean, they sound more like what you would get in the studio when you've compressed and EQd them to fit into a mix better"
- In [this comparison between AxeFX and Kemper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBvOP-29yCw) I preferred the AxeFX 
- Amplifire [How to dial in a tone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5sXy23PT8s)
- Amplifire "Amplifire takes pedals very well, and Marc Gallo has confirmed he spent a lot of time getting this right"
- Iridium "I have already used the Iridium on stage. I set nearly everything between 11 and 1 o'clock and just let her rip. It sounded fantastic! It has to be one of the most idiot-proof digital setups out there."
- Trick to simulate dual amps on the AxeFX FM3 "First, a quick note - the bass player in my main band often used a Fishman bass pedal that could produce an octave + fifth signal to a separate output and we'd run that into a Tech 21 Plexi pedal and later an Atomic Amplifirebox. Then he got an HX stomp and we created a single patch with a pitch block and two amp blocks to do the same thing. The reason for this is that we have usually just been a 1 guitar band and he would kick in the faux guitar during solos when the bass is pumping 8ths or something similar. So I wanted to do the same thing with the FM3. But there's just one amp block and I use that for an SVT amp. And there's just one cab block that has a matching 8x10 IR. The solution for the Amp block in my case was to use a Tube Drive (I think I ended up with the 3-knob version). For the cab block, there's two ways I could have done this. Take advantage of the fact that the cab block is stereo and you can use two IRs. Pan the SVT hard left and Pan the Tube Drive hard right - then adjust the balance in the cab block (this happens after the IR have been applied. Use a technique that @FractalAudio shared a while back that uses a filter and a parametric EQ to do a faux cabinet. I'm guessing it's a similar approach to what something like a Palmer PDI-09 does.  The filter and EQ uses less CPU and it's already being fed a very dramatically pitch-shifted signal so it's not exactly going to sound like a real guitar anyhow.  With the faux guitar and amp mixed just enough to be heard but not dominant, the end result is actually pretty good in a live mix - obviously this isn't something you'd do if you were recording.  So the tl;dr reason I shared this, is that you may be able to do a similar thing with the FM3 to produce your sound. Run the lows through an SVT amp/cab block and then run the highs into a Tube drive with either the filter or stereo cab technique. Since you're using a 5150, I'd use the 4-knob tube drive - it has a lot of gain on tap.  How do you split your highs/lows? Crossover? Low/high pass filters? Or?"
- Zoom G5n “Maybe you should buy some professionally created patches from Choptones to get started. Take a look at their YT demos for the ones you like - a pack is only like $10 and you will better understand the patch creation process, which uses some EQ and non traditional parameters to achieve the result - These types of settings are used by the pro patch makers on all modelers. I have a G5n and an Atomic Amplifire, and I can tell you the G5n is no slouch in the amp tone department, at least for my use.”

## Small Amp Sims ##
- Joyo American Sound (the one I have)
- Behringer GDI21 V-Tone $30 (1/4" and XLR Out, this is like that Behringer Amp that I had which sounded so fucking fantastic)



## Working with a Modeler ampsim ##
[How to make your Helix or Kemper FEEL like the real thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J02heFTwEXY&t=483s)
1. Stick a subtle compressor at the end of the chain to simulate natural tube poweramp compression. "This is more of a feel thing than a tone thing"
2. We always perceive more volume as sounding better
3. Use [subtractive EQ](https://youtu.be/J02heFTwEXY?t=609) to affect the sound after the amp and cab but before the delay and reverb
4. Use a bit of soft clipping (subtle distortion) after amp and cab to simulate speaker and poweramp breakup
5. Working with the amplifire [dialing in a tone in the amplifire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5sXy23PT8s)



## Channel Switch Lag ##
"The Diezel D-Moll doesn't have this drop issue, but it does have a little bit of a time lag when kicking in the channel change, and a bigger time lag when kicking in the fx loop. Can't speak for their other models."

"The Sig X is pretty much instantaneous across all modes."

"The Laney VH100r is instantaneous across all modes."

"The Satriani JVM is pretty much instantaneous across all modes.
Vanilla JVM definitely does it, I measure it once, about 50ms silence between changes."

Blackstar HT dont have this.  Chappers shows it off in his demo of the one and 5

[multiwatt dual rec has the problem](https://www.thefretboard.co.uk/discussion/27836/channel-switch-lag-problem).  pre multi watt doesnt but the switches eventually fail

"-You can't change between the distortion, heavy distortion, and clean settings within an amp bank. This means that in order to change between distortion and clean, you have to change between banks, and unfortunately, there is a brief pause while the VYPYR changes over. This isn't so bad for sitting at home, writing songs, but it is terrible for anything quick and on-the-go."

[Why Guitar Amp Sims Matter](https://www.musicianonamission.com/guitar-amp-simulators-vs-real/)
"Why? Four reasons.  1) You don’t have to worry about room acoustics. 2) You don’t need a microphone. 3) You don’t have to worry about noise. 4) If time is a constraint, you have a wide range of tones available in a matter of SECONDS."

Eliminating the latency problem is possible: https://youtu.be/FRrzLXuMtRo?t=294 2.16ms via quad cortex

https://www.gearslutz.com/gear/scuffham-amps/s-gear

best guitar amp sim plugins apparently by far are from Neural and STL

From Neural "Try the fortin cali and you;ll be blown away"
"To my ears the nembrini sounds more organic and has better low end.  The neural sounds too digitally perfect.  I use an evh phase 90 into nembrini and it sounds so good.  Glad someone else agrees"

Theres a comparison of amplitube vs neural and its no contest neural


## Investigate These Amp Sims ##

3. https://bedroomproducersblog.com/2012/02/21/bpb-freeware-studio-best-free-guitar-amp-simulator-vstau-plugins/
12. Free 1GB of [Tube and Solid State Harmonic Distortion Saturators](http://www.morevox.com/web/irs.html)  I wonder what that means??? Does that mean amp/cab combos?  Just the amp?  Would a guitar sound wonderful through these with no amp sim?  If not wonderful, would a guitar sound interesting through one of these?

 Paid Plugins (Test them all with big Sur)
1. ---------- Nope (for me)
1. $60 [Audio Assault Reamp studio](https://audio-assault.com/plugins.php) All of their gear for $60
1. $99 Antelope Audio (Run on Synergy Core INterface)
1. $199 Universal Audio Tweed - these are really great but kind of expensive.  I dont know how well they match against the neural dsp offerings but they are pricced to compete with them ... acutally overpriced in comparison.  I think JayLeonardJ actually had one of their interfaces which ran the DSP for these amp models ON the device (but you had to have bought them already or something)
1. Free [Studio Devil Valve Custom](https://www.studiodevil.com/products/british_valve_custom/)  Problem: Runnnig the standalone on big sur had a No sign on the icon so didnt run at all.  The plugin seemed to run but required me to 'lower the security settings for garageband' through a popup.  I did and it runs but that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  It runs with lowered security settings and I dont even know what the security settinig might have been that it changed (I checked secuirty and privacy panel and found nothing problematic or even that might have worked) and it sounds good although its completely and super bare bones.  
1. $149 [StudioDevil Amp Modeler pro](https://www.studiodevil.com/products/amp_modeler_pro/) - Mac Problem see valve custom.  I just dont trust it on mac.   tube amp emulation no branded models or even fake ones.  Demos sound fantastic.  WHOA This is the Amplifire but in software!!!  how cool!  I wouldnt even havve to buy one of those then.  Then again those are self contained and I can re-sell them so ... hmm kind of old?  Free version has problems with big sur.  Technically the free one runs in garageband tho
4. $65 [Marshall Valvestate](https://honestampsimreviews.com/2020/09/29/audiority-solidus-vs8100/) 10/10! wow!
1. Free Amplitube. Free has 5 amps and 5 cabs and a few good pedals free forever.  I got mesa for free in April 2021.  
1. $199 Amplitube.  Other amps are $30 or so pedals are $10.

1. $89 [TH-U Metal or Rock](https://overloud.com/products/th-u-metal) 
2. $299 [Overloud THU](https://overloud.com/products/th-u-full) DEAL: Some of this is free with cakewalk on windows.  Multiple amps I think. tons of options) not much community around it 
3. $399 Helix native ($99 if you have a new and registered hxstomp discounts for other products.  registers to hardware )
1. $15-25 [Vadim Taranov](http://vtaramps.blogspot.com/2020/12/slowrunner.html) has a bunch of pretty inexpensive amp sims. THey are PC only
2. $99 Bias FX 2 (Also $199 for IR Loader and more amps and guitars and $299 for more amps and guitars ) Guitar Match probably a pickup swapper, looper, presets to dl 30amps, no custom IRs in the base version.

"One major advantage of paid-IRs came up today. I noticed that the Soundwoofer Engl IR had IRs that were out of phase. I didn't even notice at first, but it became obvious when I panned 2 tracks to the same side. I know 3 Sigma Audio said they put a lot of effort into making sure that their IRs are phase aligned, so I decided to try out their Orange 4x12 IRs. I like them, but I feel like I need to get to know its personality a bit. I need more time with them to come to conclusion.  The odd thing about 3 Sigma audio IRs is that they don't use the usual format of doing 1 mic per wav file, with 1 position. They do have different positions, but their IRs are a blend of mics. I'm not quite sure what to thing of that. I can certainly use IRs well, but man, do I ever feel lost when it comes to try to compare these things."

# Attenuators and Speaker Sims and Cab Sims #
If you power up a traditional tube amp, and pull out the speaker cable, you can destroy your tube amp because a tube power section requires the resistance provided by the speaker.  You or an amp manufacturer can use an 'attenuator' or 'dummy load' to electrically take the place of a speaker.  'Attenuation' is an electrical term which in physics means 'a loss of intensity' so an attenuator lowers the intensity of the amps signal and can provide the resistance necessary to run the amp quietly or silently while not burning out the power section of a tube power amp.  Typically the attenuator will have a line level signal coming out of it which is the same as the signal that was going to go to the speaker only quieter.  This works just fine electrically however there are two caveats: 
1.  Each speaker (and cabinet) has its own characteristics which add color to the sound.  The sound you would have heard out of the speaker will be inherently different than the sound you will hear from the line out since the line out will not have been affected by the characteristics of the speaker (some say the speaker and cab are 50% of your tone).  The simple solution to this is to plug the line out into something called a 'speaker sim' aka 'cabinet sim' aka 'cab sim' which will simulate the color of some speaker and or speaker cabinet. 
2.  When the signal exits the power amp the speaker doesnt merely accept it and play the signal, the speakers resistance pushes back against the power amp to varying degrees such that the power amp has to push the sound into and through the speaker and receives impulse responses back from the speaker and some of the valueable tones we hear when playing a tube amp are a result of the interactions between the power amp and the speaker.  The responses actually improve the tone and simulating those impulse responses is a part of the latest attentuators and the best sounding speaker simulators.

- This [video of Pat Quilter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAEdc1l-t6g) shows with an oscilliscope the difference between using an actual speaker and a dummy (resistive) load. 
- This video shows what [a difference a speaker simulator makes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=138&v=l818I0TXcmM) by playing a signal with and without a speker simulator.

4. "The little known fact about ZOOM products is their super low noise floor. (-102 dB!) Noise is the enemy of music.  Yes, noise gates help, especially on those ridiculously distorted and processed metal sounds that all our inner children embrace. But you will need LESS noise gating when you build from a clean low floor. Less gating = more realistic response + better tones.  Another fact about ZOOM: they have very fast processors and high-quality converters. Any digital audio can only be as good as the converters: both A to D and D to A. No matter how good the translation from A to D and back again, unless you have the processing speed, there will be artifacts: glitches, aliasing, phase decoherence. Those artifacts are particularly nasty when a stereo signal is summed to mono, as many players do.  ZOOM processors are purpose-built for audio, unlike many other LINEs who use cheap off-the-shelf generic processors in their entry level products. The ENTIRE ZOOM line uses the same quality converters and processors, even in their least expensive models.   ZOOM keeps prices low by purchasing a Zillion high-quality processors for the entire line, instead of using cheap chips in cheap pedals.  In general, all zoom audio stuff is high-quality, regardless of price-point. Super low noise. Super fast processors. Few if any artifacts. And they all sum to mono beautifully. Obviously the best way to use any effect is in stereo, but not every gig justifies carrying the extra gear. So that summing feature is CRUCIAL. "  All of that rationale is right and is probably true among guitar gear compared to digitech or korg or something but the zoom interfaces have a higher ein than the best ones (see my ein numbers)



## FX Loop Attenuators ##
Find new tones and dial in more usable tones, zero has no volume but 1 or 2 is MUCH too loud expands your amps range of volume.
1. Carls Custom Volume Box $24 (FX Loop Attenuator)
2. JHS Little Black Box $45 (FX Loop Attenuator)


## Impedances ##
1. Speakers: 4-16 Ohms
2. Headphones: 25-300 Ohms
3. DJ Headphones: 27-70 Ohms

Headphones with low impedance (<25Ohms) require little power to deliver high audio levels however are more susceptable to blowouts when using more powerful amplifiers.  Headphones with higher impedance demand more power to deliver high audio levels but as a result are protected from damage from overloading.



## Impulse Responses (IRs) ##
- https://www.ownhammer.com/store/
- Celestion makes some of the best
- [Some good free ones](https://www.redwirez.com/free1960g12m25s.jsp) which is demoed [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jugofWFouLE)
- "I have the ampli firebox nd was considering the Iridium until I bought some OwnHammer IRs.  The OwnHammer's sound WAY better than the stock Atomic IRs. Also, I thought a single cab/speaker IR was just that...a single IR...but no. They are so many different types of mic choices and mic placements that come with a single $7.99 purchase. I didn't count, but I'd guess around 40-50 different choices in the zip file.  I'm no expert, but to me the Ownhammer's are way less "woofy"? and the pick attack sounds much more natural. I know, sounds can be hard to explain."
- Beyerdynamic by signing up to a list https://youtu.be/pTLu6HpBFBA&t=300s
- "PSA: If you prefer the sound of one of these over the others, it's almost certainly the IRs you prefer. Don't buy IR loaders on sound. Buy for the features that you need, and then get some Ownhammer IRs and sound spectacular regardless."
- "I agree that changing the IRs in the Amplifire makes a big difference. They are stock matched cabs in this video, but when I've recorded and gigged with the AA3 I've used third party cabs, usually Michael Britt's."
- "Saw a clip today of the Axe II, Amplifire and Zoom G3n doing Plexi tones. Once the same OwnHammer impulse was added, they all sound spot on to each other" [AXEFX vs Amplifire vs Zoom G3x](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtZlAzVQ7EE)
- “You can get the Two Notes Wall of Sound plugin just by buying one impulse response from them (which I think one of them is around $12) and the WoS plugin gives you the option to add a power-amp section along with the speaker impulse. So you wouldn't lose anything by not using the amp's power section. “”
- “To quickly audition blends, you can record the Amplifire with cabs turned off, put it on loop in your DAW, then use a free IR convolver like NadIR that can load dual IRs and experiment.”
- bunch of free ones came with the yamaha thr100dh

1. *$199 Audient ID4 -130 (AMAZIING) (use the wheel as a controller) (one video comparison reported that it lost more tone after 500 reamps than the SSL) USBTypeB  Has cool way to control your computer!

I believe that is latency from input to output monitoring WITHIN the device from its input direct to its output.      Round Trip latency is from the device to the pc and back out to your headphones.

2. For future investigations: Look up Thunderbolt interfaces which will be $600 and up but the added speed of thunderbolt and the quality of these interfaces could be worth it.  For example: UAD Arrow Thunderbolt is the least noisy of all in Ola’s comparison with the SSL2.  His other interface is perhaps more pro but not in every way and its much more expensive.

<!-- DUDE1 -->




Notes:
1. Boss Katana: Boss Tone Studio for Katana works on Macos 11.2.2 (Confirmed on my mac).  Drivers for katana last updated in Dec 2019.  
1. Boss GT001: last updated 2017, officially supported only up to OS10.15 Confirmed to work on my mac.  Drivers seemed to install just fine (when allowed permissions). [Glenn Delaune for Great GT001 presets](https://youtu.be/w1um7s_MCz8)  and [Joshua Munday for Boss GT100/GT001 patches](https://www.guitarfxpatches.com)
1. Boss GT1000Core: Last updated Oct2020, M1 macs not yet supported
1. Zoom: Zoom software (at least for the gce3) works on mac.  Confirmed on my mac.    
10. Blackstar: id:Core and:series have great software but its based on microsoft silverlight so doesnt and wont work on mac :( I tried installing it on my mac and after forcing me to install mono several times (and i already had it installed) and restarting it still wouldnt install the actual software.  
1. Fender Mustang: Fender Tone software works on mac Big sur.  PLUS theres an iOS app with great reviews for GT and GTX
10. Vox VT doesnt have usb recording.  Tone Librarian software doesnt work on Big Sur :( (tested - it has 0 on its icon and wont run
1. Comments: It seems like most of these neglect to update their software for their older units but I dont exactly blame them since many of their customers (windows users) wont have the same set of problems.  Most of them that have mac compat at least have it compatible with the latest OS for their latest products.  Blackstar seems to be the exception here.  
1. Nux MG30 and MG300 QuickTone software works on Mac (tested both)
1. Here this guy [uses nux mg300 to play rocksmith](https://www.reddit.com/r/rocksmith/comments/kd8u4f/play_rocksmith_with_nux_is_awesome_great_sound/) "Connect pedal via usb,install asio drivers, configure nux interface in rs_asio.ini Download and run QuickTone (thats the nux software), in the usb settings choose the dry mode.In this mode you send clean tone from your guitar directly to rocksmith. Run Rocksmith and turn off your guitar sound in the mixer. Choose preset in nux or make your own sound - and play rocksmith. And thats all! Nux is mixing rocksmith output with fx tone in stereo, all feutures in rocksmith 100% working, great sound modelling with impulse response, no latency problem!"
1. Comments: None that I am aware of (even line6) are compatible with M1 macs yet.  I wonder who the first will be?  I suspect Line6 or Fractal, 
1. Yamaha: Some models have USB Record out.  For others its not advertised.  Software (THRHD_H) runs on Mac Big Sur!   THD apparently earlier versions used to have wet dry 4 channel audio with a steinberg driver https://www.jazzguitar.be/forum/recording-music-software/79906-usb-out-yamaha-thrii.html
1. Atomic Amplifire software works on Mac Big Sur (Tested!)
1. Mooer GE300 software says its only ycompatible with 10.15 and does seem to run on Big Sur although couldnt find the device so it instantly closed. 
1. Valeton GP100 software works on Big Sur.  in Taylor Danleys video he shows how to make the usb signal dry too!
1. [Using XSonic XTone with iPad](https://thesweetsetup.com/playing-guitar-from-my-ipad/)
1. Fractal FM3 Editt software is updated in March 2021 and is compatible with Catalina which is a promising note about them keeping it up to date with future versions of macos and the m1
1. IK Product Manager works on Mac Big Sur installed and ran fine
1. Omec Teleport: Does it provide midi somehow?, buffered input.  You can input audio as well as send it out to USB.  Oh! Guitar in, Run it into amplitube or some other amp sim on your usb or iphone (how it works with iphone blows my mind), then it comes back with the guitar out of the first signal and the sound from the usb out the second signal?    It has to be quiet then doesnt it?  No it doesnt work quite like that.  
1. Audient Evo 4  [Here it says 128](https://evo.audio/products/evo-4/specs/)


[casually mentions mac can use bt midi footswitch (irig blueboard)](https://youtu.be/RE9YIkcDm7U?t=100)

# Pedals #


### MIDI Footswitch ###
- Some FX Units can respond to midi signals and if they can I can make my own Footswitch that uses MIDI over USB or just MIDI to do anything I want!   
- [The first clue about using a home made midi footswitch with Zoom MS50G](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/99bv2d/question_looking_for_a_good_tube_amp_for_bedroom/e4mnaag/)
- Behringer MIDI Foot Controller FCB1010 "If you get the chip, make sure you specify the version with smooth CCs on the pedals. The original behringer software is very crude at the bottom of the pedal travel. The regular UNO emulates this - but there is an UNO version that 'corrects' this nonsense and supplies a nice smooth CC output from bottom to top." This can apparently work pretty well with the Kemper. Behringer MidiPedalboard with Uno for Kemper can work too for cheaper.
- For HX Stomp check out [this MIDI Pedal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db6JQp46QYI)

## Other Cool Pedals##

- Keely 30ms Double Tracker (reverb stereo chorus and doubletracking)
- EHX Freeze (lets you sustain a note) [Tricks to use this pedal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjFth1mg5Rc)

## Drums ##
- Digitech Trio (whole band in a pedal)


## Cool pedal companies ##
- Wampler (love the pedals, intolerance)
- JHS pedal products have my respect
- Baroni-Lab
- AMT


# Loopers #
- My Zoom device works as a looper!
- $70 VSN Twin Looper Electric - Most of same features as the nux but 2 buttons BUT only 10min of loop rather than 8hrs.  looks simpler honestly.  no drums.
- $199 Ditto x2 Looper ($130 used) (5min, unlimited undo/redo, 2 buttons, half speed playback, USB for load save (at least it will let you load backing tracks onto it))
- $199 Boss RC3 (3h, 99 locations, usb, drum patterns, problems transferring files?)
- $199 Boss RC5 (USB for wavs, 99 phrases, external control, 13h, )
- $308 Boss RC10r (6hrs, 280 drum presets, 16kits, midi, option for 100% analog signal, 99 phrases, 2 tracks, 2 external controls)
- -----------------
- Boss RC1 Loop Station (can use with external 2 button footswitch, 12min, stereo, USB for wave upload download)
- $99 Donner New Circle Looper with drum machine (save loops for later, can sync with drum track (remember which one per loop), ) (out of stock)
- $99 Nux Loopcore - Strange reviews that concern me, usb, speed up slow down loops, drum machine, 8hrs, only one button - but 2 button Footswitch!!!  Might work well just as a recorder honestly ...
- Elecroharmonix
- NO TC Wiretap Riff Recorder (Sync with iphone, 8hrs on pedal, tap to record) (bought and it was a mess)
- "If I could travel backward in time to meet my younger self... I'd bring a Ditto Looper and say, 'Practice with this pedal. It will help your playing enormously, and you'll have a great time." - Paul Gilbert
- $350 Digitech Trio+ Band Creator (3 button external footswitch (TRS)) (older version discontinued)
- $130 Ditto+ one button so I dont want it but ... this plus version has usb to upload and also has dynamic loop length 
- ------------------
- Jam Man solo xt ('I have a jam man solo xt with aux in and it converts aux in to mono.")
- $700 Headrush Loopboard
- Pigtronix Infinity
- $200 Used Line6 JM4 Looper (4 loops?)
- $200 Used Ditto X4 Looper
- EHX Memory Box
- $100 used Digitech SDrum (not a looper but drums)

More loopers are [listed here](https://musiccritic.com/equipment/pedals/looper-pedals/) 


# Expression Pedals #

I want a cool Pressure pedal.  To do this I need polarity switch and also continuous input, aka half-damper aka half-pedaling.  If I need to I could buy or build a polarity reversing adapter.  I could like get a splitter stereo to dual mono LR, then couplers, then another splitter/combiner and just swap them ...
- Roland DP10 $50 has continuous input which apparently means you can use it as an expression pedal.  I want to try that
- KorgDS1h $55 has half-damper ... its got a trs cable which I didnt think it would
- -----
- Yamaha fc3a $40 (reviews indicate that there isn't usable travel between on and off, yes its continuous but dont even think about going halfway or 1/4 thats one reviewer anyway)

Notes: "It appears this is a simple on/off switch pedal. For continuous or gradient performance the phrases to look for in sustain pedal description are "half-damper" or "half-pedaling." If there is no indication by the manufacturer of one of those descriptions, the pedal is just an on/off switch. If your digital piano or elec... see more"
Note for polarity reversing trick (which I dont think will work with guitar fx but hey) "If a sustain pedal plugged into a Yamaha keyboard is producing the opposite effect - sustaining when the pedal is not depressed, and not sustaining when it is depressed - it's usually because (a) the pedal was plugged in while the keyboard was turned on, or (b) the pedal was depressed while the unit was powering on. This tricks the keyboard into thinking the default state of the pedal is depressed, resulting in a reverse polarity or reverse function. There's an easy way to remedy this: 1) With the unit turned on and the sustain pedal plugged in, depress and hold the sustain pedal while you power the unit off.2) Release the sustain pedal once the unit has been turned off.3) Turn the unit back on."

Note Polarity is also known as latch/unlatch and some keyboards (roland ) have a latch unlatch settign built intto the kb.
Note For the korg "Notice the Korg website has a new driver "Korg Kontrol Editor", which allows for software-based polarity switching. However, I found that this pedal work perfectly right out of the box. Notice the Korg website has a new driver "Korg Kontrol Editor", which allows for software-based polarity switching. However, I found that this pedal work perfectly right out of the box."

# Shelves #
Ideally 19.5Wx10Hx12D


### Needs ###
Would like the top shelf to be 40-44" tall so I can tweak that one and the ones below it too
< 22" wide to fit in the closet door
Ideally <10"deep to fit just in front of my other amp and still close the closet door

Closet is probably 24" across, but the door opening would clear 22" just barely

## Shelves I bought ##
4 shelves
Could accomodate 19.5Wx10Hx12D


|-----4-----|
|10H		|
|19.5W		|
|-----3-----|
|10H		|
|19.5W		|
|-----2-----|
|11.5H		|
|19.5W		|
|-----1-----|

6" Deep for 1 shelf
12.5" Deep for both together

19.5W is within the current boundaries.  With heavy modifications could support up to 21".  Could possibly flip shelves to make more height 



### How wide are they so far ###
How wide are the amps that I want on this thing?
How deep are they?

#### Medium Sized Heads ####
NOFIT Morgan MVP23 20Wx10Dx10H
NOFIT Bassbreaker 15 is 19.6Wx9Dx10H
FIT!! Blackstar HT5RH  17.4Wx9Hx9D 
FIT!! Superchamp X2 is 17.5Wx9Dx8H


#### Small Heads ####
FIT!! Laney L5 Studio 16Wx8Dx8H
FIT!! VHT Special 6 head 15Wx8Dx9.5H
FIT!! Peavey Classic 20 mini 14Wx8Dx8H
FIT!! H&K Tubemeister 18 14Wx6Dx6H
FIT!! Blackstar HT1RH 13Wx8Dx8H
FIT!! EVH 5150 III Lunchbox 13Wx7Dx7H
FIT!! H&K Tubemeister 5 10Wx6Hx6D
FIT!! Mooer Little Monster 8Wx5Dx5H

#### Tiny Heads ####
Could fit 2-4 of these on one shelf!
FIT!! Micro Terror 7Wx4Dx6H
FIT!! Micro Dark 7Wx4Dx6H
FIT!! Joyo 6.4Wx4.3Dx5.5H
FIT!! Mooer LIttle Monster 7.4Wx4Dx4H




Most will fit in 20W
Most will fit in 10H (not VHT or Blackstar)
Most will fit in 10D (not Morgan or VHT)


Ideally 40" Tall x 20" Wide x 10" deep with 12" between shelves 

- This one is 22 Wide x 42 High x 6 deep which isnt deep enough unless I strapped them on.  The top shelf is really more like 37" tall and it seems like it would tip over pretty easily, but I really like it though because it would be so easy to put away [This one](https://www.amazon.com/4-Tier-Kitchen-Storage-Cupboard-Casters/dp/B01KUZLAY4/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=rolling+kitchen+shelves&qid=1565147962&s=gateway&sr=8-8)
    - I could get two of them and tie them together to make them deeper and more stable!?!
- This one is 17 Wide x 41 High x 10 deep which seems perfect, but the top shelf is really more like 37" tall and plus has more shelves than I need and not enough space in between so I would have to remove some [This one](https://www.amazon.com/Cozzine-Lockable-Organizer-Shelving-Bathroom/dp/B07CQFR9BN/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=rolling+kitchen+shelves&qid=1565147962&s=gateway&sr=8-7)

# Power Cables Adapters #
Center is the same as Tip
Center Negative = Tip Negative

## What do I want in a power cable? ##
5. 9V
6. 5.5x2.1mm tip
3. Center Negative
4. 1A-2A
1. 6ft+ cable
2. Lots of amazon reviews
7. <$15

One Amp is important for some select pedals (Behringer) but most only require 300mA so that 0.5A will do.

THe Zoom needs Center Negative 9V

Most if not all 9V power supplies have the same tip.

These pedals seem to have the same adapters as Casio AD-5 
Casio SA-46 has center positive but otherwise the same

### Options ###
1. [$10.89, 9V, High Ratings, .8-1A, Tip Negative, 10ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DXF97BR/) The plug on this one looks wrong, but all of my research says it isn't [Same Device but more expensive and specific to the FX](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DND9Y1D)
2. [12.99, 9V, Few Ratings, 1.0A, Tip Negative, 6ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QC6L35G) This one seems really high quality
3. [$19.95, 9V, High Ratings, 2A, Tip Negative, 10Ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003OCLKP0) This one is not a wall wart so seems of the highest quality.  dont know what Amps though but since its got a big block its probably high amps?  [More Info about this at Amazon UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0077CZSZ6)
4. [12.99, 9V, Highest, 1A, Tip Negative, 6.5ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7FCC3P/) This looks like the finest cable with the best ratings.  
4. [$14.99, 9V, High Ratings, 1.0A, Tip Negative, 4-10ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KVT1DMQ/) This one has extensions for 8 devices

#### Runners up for various reasons ####
1. [$7.39,  9V, High Ratings, 0.5A, Tip Negative, 6.0ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00191WVF6)
2. [$7.99,  9V, High Ratings, .85A, Tip Negative, 6.6ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07234PV7Q)
3. [$6.99,  9V, Few  Ratings, 2.0A, Tip Negative, 3.3ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Z4Z32H1)

5. [$12.96, 9V, Few  Ratings, 1.0A, Unknown,         8ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JX4WPLG)
4. [12.49, 9V, No Ratings, 1.0A, Tip Negative, 6ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PLS3RHP) Probably the same device as the $10.89 one above.  Not Prime.
3. [$8.98, 9V, Few Ratings, 1.0A, Tip Negative, 6ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WJPXKNI) No amazon prime and it seems cheap


## Power ##
USB Power technically works, but its super noisy no matter how I arrange batteries or whatever.
1. $30 Donner Power Supply 
2. $50 Dunlop DC Brick
3. $30 AGPTEK CP-05 new
4. $37 Caline Power CP-04
5. $120 Caline Power CP-06+ Is a battery with isolated supplies!  
6. Rechargeable 9v batteries can also be plugged into a little cable and plugged into the top of the pedal. No noise.  easy replacement and recharging and access.


This thing is a super quiet power supply with noise suppression for audio.  its $50 and comes in 5,9,12,and 15v versions and could help power some power splitters for pedals or just one pedal. 
https://www.amazon.com/iPower-Supply-International-Travel-Adapters/dp/B01GNNXP0Y/ 

On reverb there is a Soul Power Instruments Mobile Power (6 outputs inclued 2 isolated, USB Bus-powered Power Suply) which runs on USB up to 2.5A input usb current and outputs to 4 9v power or 2 isolated one 500mA and one 1000mA
Otehrs like this include Mission Engineering 529 and Mosky Power Statiion Nano
or the Rockboard with 50h of 9v power for 2-3 1A devices.

# What I Want #
Goals: Need to be able to easily get a killer brown sound and a killer warm creamy shimmering clean.

- Small
- Easy to plug in
- Easy to move
- Rechargeable
- Sexy

Possibly Also:
- Tinkerable: Independent of the warm soupy guitar tone of tube amps I really like the idea of tinkering with effects on a two monitor computer workstation and having the sound reflect what I do on my computer.  Probably want to pick the one that has the most presets from other people so I can work with other peoples stuff.
- Multiple amps: I like the idea of running my signal into multiple amps or amp sims.  Possibly for stereo effects, possibly just to create a more complete tone.  See [this video](https://youtu.be/iEgNn469gdg?t=649) at about 11 min for a demo of two amps at once (piranha and microdark) and how good it sounds and how much they love it

New Desires
- Lightweight
- Controllable at eye level (not on the floor)
- Few cables (easy to set up)
- Great sounds
- Wah
- Looper Pedal (not too many cables)
- Solid power cable
- Dirty/Clean/Boost from footswitch

How to setup a station?  
1. A folding chair, a nice table, several guitar cables running to the ground that can be clipped back onto the table.  
2.. just pick up the expression pedal and looper (zoom?) put them on the ground no cables to plug or anything.
3. A built in power strip with a single long cable that I can easily plug into the wall.
4. Two little speakers mounted on stands.  pc speakers? Mounted Speakerbar at ear height Compromise: 1 bluetooth triangle speaker mounted on a bendable mic stand which sticks up  from the table with all cables routed really well and has power plugged into it already or batteries for the floor devices so no power?

One thing I want to do: 1. a device to play backing tracks so it will plug into a 
headphone amp or little mixer on the desk that the qc also plugs into right before it gets to the speaker
and an easy way to run it out to the speaker.  
(this could be an old phone or ipod touch but it should be built into the rig somehow)

One device with 2 footswitches and an expression pedal.  Looper play/dub, start/stop, Expression for wah.
Footswitches easily put on the floor from a simple table which has the rest of the gear and easily fits in a cabinet.  with a speaker mounted on top of the table
Basically no compromises

I like the idea of a Transparent Overdrive first (with a bit of EQ) then a wah then a tubescreamer into a signal splitter which gives me one to two slightly detuned signals and then into a 5150 and then into light delay then light reverb.  For solos boost the signal into the tubescreamer or add a rat or klon and turn the delay up 10-20%

-->                                         


Gear Details:
1. Purple Pickups in Limelight: 1. As soon as I had them plugged in I thought I didnt like them.  They are lower output than any of my others, but spending 20 miin with them and I'm warming to them.  They are warm and the neck one on cleans is really clear actually.  They are not bright and they are possibly missing some upper range to me, but still have a pretty good set of  harmonics.  I really like the neck clean sound really like it.  chimey. clear. warm. sweet.  its got something weird when I drive it.  I wonder if its my wiring?  Like when I really hit it hard on the unmatched ... maybe its my headphone speakers or the EQ in my boss.  ok iin the boss I changed the input calibration from -1 to -7 that fixed the distortion.  My other guitars didn't distort quite like that.  Sustain is great right now actually.  high gain is great on arena mode with bridge or regular pickups .  I guess its lower output and maybe that controls arena mode better or something but it sounds and works and feels great.  NOTE:  All of this is in the back of my mind with a feeling that there is something missing but not a problematic somethiini gjust a premium or boutique or quality or something else that I deserve.  On orange crush mode it sounds pretty shitty
1. JB 59 Chrome set in Limelight.  The 59 isnt wired right, it has a signal but is problematically scratchy. The JB is awesome in its own way. In this guitar it does things that none of my others do.  It kind of breaks compatabiliity with my patches!  half of the patches that I had previously designated as good or great, just sound shitty with this pickup, and half that I had previouslyy designated as shitty sound great!?!  Its weird but that plus the wiring problem makes me  uncomforable about them.  Before I even wired it in I ordered a purple super distortion, maybe that will fit in better?
1. It seems like this boss is more sensitive than a normal amp to the guitar and the pickups.  It doesnt sound even remotely similar with different guitars ... but then thats not even entirely true because Billy ocean sounded like limelight with those pink pickups.  I dont know its confusing! 



- Boss GT001 - mar 28 I got this mar 23 or so love it so much.  Dry Recording, MIDI Synth Pickup built in, Dual amping, so many blocks to play with.  Its a guitarists DREAM.  The sound is good, the noise is low, I can mostly use the garageband amps, I can recocrd dry and then use whatever gb effects and amps and plugins I want.  I can effortlessly (even accidentally which is how I figured it out) use MIDI!! I had a midi track selected on accident, hit record and watched notes being added for no reason and it blew my mind.  I’m so excited that I sent videos to lots of my friends and family.  Configuration via boss gt tone studio is really fantastic and works great even on mac big sur.  
	- update Mar 27.  Ordered lots of things from amazon including new pickups for both of my new guitars.  We’ve been itching to do soldering projects and its important that all of my guitars sound fantastic.  I also bought some really premium pickups from some dude on thegearpage.  
		- update later Mar 27.  Cristi suggested I get some recorded tones from my new guitars so we can do a before and after pickup swaps so I recorded what ended up being a magical song with the horseman.  The clean tones are not problematic at all with either one its just the high gain tones that dont really work.  They are all flabby.  Theres no chunk or tightness.  It sounds like these pickups are from a super cheap early 90s crap guitar and like the amp is from a gorilla amp.  not entirely, the fx are good and there are nice tones like when I hit an open chord or sometimes when I do a bend, its just mostly the flabbiness and shittiness of the chunk and rhythm.  
		- update later Mar 27.  I decided to get some contrast by recording some high gain with my brown guitar but you kknow what ... it sounds crappy too right now :(.  I have a sneaking suspicion that these boss high gain presets are problematic.
		- update later Mar 27.  Before we watch tv together Cristi told me to plug into my amp real quick where I know the sounds are great and hot damn both of my new guitars sound fantastic in their own ways!  They dont need new pickups!  Theyre great as they are!  lol I have been fooled by stinky presets!!
	- New presets: I’m now searching youtube for how to set this up so it sounds fantastic.  I found 3 resourcces: tone central (which is built into the tone studio app), guitarpatches.com, and youtube (search for the type of tone you want + ‘gt001 patch’ or ‘gt100 patch’), 
		- at guitarpatches.com there are lots of patches even like 30 from 2020.  there arent any from 2021 but this device is from 2014 so i dont blame anyone for thinking its not the new hotness and digging into it deep. there are 20-30 from every year except only a few from 2017 but even after that there were many submitted.  
	- Input Calibration: Ok I’m hearing from several sources on youtube that I need to do input calibration of my guitars.  I need for the input settings to be not too much and not too little.  This is an interesting ‘weakness’ you might say of this is that you cant save input settings with presets or name the input settings you have to set it manually and globally.  It does save it though but its kind of like assuming either the input will be similar enough between your guitars that it doesnt matter (which I think is naive) or that you will just memorize the settings or something.  It also doesnt really give you a way to determine or calibrate your input but it does give you the TOOLS to be able to figure it out if you are an enterprising guitar tinkerrer.  This is the kind of thing that Helix, AxeFX and Kemper probably have totally figured out.  probably pod does too.  probably a good half of the other ones do too.   You should be able to save a certain number of global presets even if its just like 5.  Still its certainly not a showstopper worst case you can stick a little sticky note on your device with different guitar input settings.  You know whats cool is I have lots of memories these days of things that i did on my Korg AX30g in 1996 but back then I really didnt know what I was doing.  I remember doing some kind of input calibration and not knowing or caring what it meant and not being sure I got it right.  I remember it saying I should do it so I did it, then I remember later thinking I needed to do it again every time I turned it on or something.  Maybe there was even a master knob setting for that or something.  
		- For this input calibration there are a few videos about it on youtube and some of them talk about makign a wah that engages when the input gets to a certain max point 126/127 or soemthing.  Theres already a preset for this on guitarpatches.com called [input calibration guitar](https://guitarpatches.com/patches.php?mode=show&unit=GT100v2&ID=11798) with instructions on how to use it in the description. 
		- Thinking back even my korg had synth in it with thata step filter thing.  Apparenlty helix has soomething that sounds a lot like that.  but with helix i cant tell whether theres a guitar involvd. it seem slike its just synth being played from the footswitches.  
		- Trying these guitars with these presets, Mr Brownstone is just naturally tighter than Limelight I think.  Limelight doesnt have a pickup problem but there is an inherent tightness difference to the chunk.  Maybe anyway.  The bass in limelight is maybe a little bit flabby maybe?  Maybe certain pickups can tighten it up?  Maybe its a character I can use?  Some of the presets work better with limelight sort of.  Theres less heat but more harmonics believe it or not.  Theres less noise but also less gain.  it sounds wonderful but doesnt metal as well perhaps.  Maybe the pickups are more PAF in this one and more HFS in brownstone? the sustain in limelight on an open a note is insane!  BUT WAIT ... I havent done input calibration yet.  Ok I did that and mr brownstone is still way clearer and tighter.  Input seems to be the same .   WAIT the pickup height on limelight on bridge is pretty high.  Maybe if I lower it but then raise the input it would sound different?  Reminder: The pickup switch is ... backwards in that one and I wonder if that means they swapped the pickups or the switch?  Maybe swapping the pickups back would be good.  whats really cool is soemtimes when I strum limelight its so acoustic and singing that I cant quite tell if its not an amplified sound or not!
		- tip: To start out for the first few weeks: pick one guitar adn one speaker and calibrate to that and adjust your settings to match that and dont change naything and punch in new tones and get a few that you really like like 4-10 that are good and usable and name them after the guitar LLChorusComp or whatever
	- WOW the boss has some kind of DAW control features?!? theyre in the menu.  like the 4 favorites buttons become pause an dplay and record?  how coool!
	- When I turn the patch down to 0 volume the dry signal doesnt come through to amplitube anymore.  Why not?  thats weird.  it should come through the same regardless of patch volume.  Does that mean I have to control the dry signal volume through patch level?  I thought the patch would have zero bearing on that. 
	- I dont know the best way to send the dry signal to amplitube plugin while basically turning OFF all of the boss effects?  maybe an empty patch?  The level still matters  alot though.  but the thing is I dont even want a dry signal coming in through the headphones  
	- ok good news the patch level doesnt affect the sound at least when moniitoring through the computer.    Update: Sometimes it totally does.  like right now I have amplitube set to channels 3 and 4 (should be dryy) and when I change the patch volume theyy go hot and when patch volume goes to 0 they go dead.  I think amplitube got confused.  I restarted and in garageband it works as expected; channel 1 and 2 of the boss are based on patch level, channels 3 and 4 are not.  I think amplitube got confused and said 3 but actually was looking at 1 
	- Ok I dont think this is a problem.  I made a patch . Turned its volume to 0 and it works fine.
	- Advantage of usiinig the boss for headphones?  it gets WAY louder than the computers headphone jack does so when I’m usiinig a quiet plugin it still works.
- ===== Amplitube 5.  Just downloaded it.  10 authorizations (ever? or at a time?).  Username requires a number. 	It looks really interesting.  How to turn all of the boss fx off?  OH Interesting: changing the fx in the boss is changing fx in amplitube for some reason and in some wayy!?!   
	- I got the triple rec and it sounds fantastic!  I dont know iif it sounds real.  I dont know if I have optimized it, but with two overdrive pedals one max drive and one high level 0 drive, it sounds like a beautiful gutteral buzz saw!super rich and throaty and lovely on open chords.    
	- I really like how preset savving works.  theres tons of metadata and even a notes section and data about your guitar.
	- I love that all of these amps are free.  There are tons that arent but just filter by the ones you have and there are plenty to make tons of great tones and see what its like playyingi through a plugin. 
	- Lets see if i can get a liquid gain tone from this rig.  Yeah I got somethiing
	- This rhyythm tone is missing somethiing.  Its throaty but its like ... open wah and isnt cuttinig through
	- WHOA yyou can multi amp 2 amps even on the free one!  3 amps if you buy iit! OH no two isnt free there are two in the chain but it doesnt let you run them both afaik. update yeah iti lets you!
	- Features in full version only: Looper, 3 amps simultaneous (2 is free).
	- I like how it sounds, my strings feel powerful right now for chords
	- But compared to the friedman on boss I feel like I’m having to fight to get the lead tones I want.  the notes and harmoniics are not jumping off of the strings like I deserve, and I dont think its going to cut through. 
	- When i switched back to boss I immediately got a better sound that felt better and rocked harder adn was more liquid.
	- I am not truly getting that much gain from the triple rec and that cant be right.  that thing is supposed to be a monster, but it wasnt until I put multiple overdrive sin front.  maybe I need an empty boss patch with a relatively high level to start with?
	- I’m trying it without monitoring through the boss instead monitioring from the computers headphone jack.  there is SLIGHT Latency probably <100ms but there was basically none in the boss.  and it seems like there was none when monitoring through the boss too.
	- Changed buffer to 16 and latency is much smaller.  change it to 2048 and its allmost unplayyable.
	- Its a nice crunch sound by default.   It responds to the volume control on the guitar real nice with this crunch.  Sounds fantastic.  I like the low gain on the triple rec.  it sounds lovelyy and tube like just breaking up.   I really do like the tube feel on some of these settings.  It sounds sweet and lovely like roasting tubes ready to crank.  
	- clean recto channel has so small volume II almost cant make it audible
	- annoyance: its too easy on the pedals to miss the dial and pick up the pedal.
	- annoyance: its too easy fro a tooltip from the lower pedal dial to block clicking on the upper pedal dial
	- THe presets all kind of suck
	- I dont think theres much gaini ini this triple rec tbh its weird!  A video I saw sounded similar and boosted with a drive but I dont have a tubesccreamer ... maybe I can use the boss for that?  or the zoom if necessary.
	- Apparently I didnt instlal the custom shop isi that a problem?
	- you can adjust input gain in the plugin as well as in the boss I dont know if you can adjust output gain from the boss for the dry signal but you can adjust input gain in the boss for the dry ... I thiink ... yes confirmed.
	- every minute or two it cliicckups (new word!) probably thats the buffer/latency adjustment?
	- annoyance: The sliders dont let you click to set the point they make you find the dot and drag it over, even the input and output gaini sliders.
	- Really nice tuner but only when you click on the one IN the signal chaiin not at the bototm.
	- Ok I’m getting some damn great tones out of it now.  Maybe the most ‘complete’ and meaty and grizzling rhyythm tone I’ve ever had for like full chords and palm muting and string scraping across rhythm sounds.  its honestly amazing.  Can I get sounds like that from the Boss?  I have my doubts tbh.
	- Theres a certaini level of noise but the cabinet makes a HUGe difference wrt that problem.
	- I’m getting a pretty good singing lead tone but its still nto as liquid as it is on the boss. yet.  I’ve got a beautiful thick syrupy singing lead tone, however its still not quite jumping off of the fretboard like the boss.  maybe more gain?
	- Even the super high gain overdrives roll off the volume and theyy clean up real nice and authentic.  
	- WOW as a plugin I’m reallyy impressed!  it innstalled right into garageband all I had to do was select it on the track holy crap!  It doesnt have my presets from the standalone but thats ok I can either transfer them or re-make them
	- Amplitube with the green USB guitar interface is ... well  ... mostly problematic but with the right settings is usable.  There is a constnat noise even when the guitar is off.  This validates my findings from the last month: this device is mega noisy and not really usable for plugins.  however it turns out if you turn the input gaini ALL th eway down in amplitube the noise is APPARENTLY less noticeable and you can get decent guitar tones out of it somehow.  if you turn it up you cant even get those tones.  I might even be deceivving myself about the noise but the tones are in fact decent and woudl be usable for some thiinigs.  
	- update: Well I love it actually but all of a sudden on apr 21 it doesnt start anymore :( idk why.  Restarting.  Ok now it works.  Maybe it was the multiple displays I had runningi?  Yeah if you drag it to the second display it clears right up!  The plugiin version doesnt seem to work at all with two monitors until you switcch back to 1.  theres probably anothe rway to refresh it though.  Also its not actualllyy loading and just not displaying.
	
- ===== Fortin Cali Suite
	- Well as soon as I changed input to Boss GT001 it crashed which is not a good sign.
	- The license management was pretty annoying and kind of scares me that it will decide in a few months after some system update ... yeah this isn’t active for you anymore.  We are at the mercy of at least 5 registration systems that some or all have to communicate properly: ilok website, neural website, ilok manager on mac, neural software, some kind of license manager between them that was auto installed
	- Features
		- Great tuner
		- the gate is nice at least at this gain level
		- The feel of the knobs like the two finger trackpad scrolling on the output knob is fantastic, 
		- even and especially the knobs on the pedals feel amazing to turn with trackball or trackpad
	- sound
		- decent but not stunning sound out of the box for me.  not problematic.  not liquidy. not much grit to a chord.
		- it feels good and responsive
		- I’m tweaking knobs to try to find a sound I love.  
		- Ok the acdc vibes are growing on me at least when I dig in with the pick
		- the cleans are crystal clear and warm.  
		- Can the cleans get 
		- Something with this and other plugins and possibly even my boss is turniing the volume down on myy guiitar loses the signal too quick.  I wonder if its my wiring?  I wonder if its the noise gate?  it ducks in and out when I turn it down on my guitar even to 6-8  nope its not a noise gate from teh cali suite anyway.  Even playinig quietly does that.  Could this be impedance related?  wouldnt the boss fix that?  Ok I switched the boss back to input level 0 from input -2db.  And I switched to my core PRS.  Still an issue.  
		- Its NOT the guitar.
		- Lets switch the Interface to the Audient that I just got. 	NOPE its not as simple as that either.  I’ve got the dial all the way up on the evo and still when I play quietly its ducking.  lets try a different amp sim
		- With amplitube ... it doesnt seem to be ducking at all.
		- Ok back to cali (thats a song) ok Playyingi with some things I think it  was the zuul pedal all along.  I dont know what that does but I’m glad it did it.  I appreciate that this default setting made me go try out a bunch of gear and configurations, plug in my new interface, get it all working, listen carefully to its sounds, try several guitars, and learn a ton over the last 20-30min.  I’m sort of really happy right now.
		- OK Now it is starting to really show promise and I’m excited.
		- The cleans are very nice, b
		- Now I want some killer drive and WOW I got it!  Turn on that drivve pedal and it sounds fantastic!  Harmonics and rock sounds!  Open chords ring and grind for a long time.  All of the open chords too.  With amplitubes mesa the grind is there on the d but the E gets muddy.  With this the e is amazing just like the D.
		- Now lets see if I can get a liquidy lead tone (after I noodle with the OD sounds some more)  Yeah I got that pretty easily.  Its not the SAME as the recto and I like the recto in amplitube, but its fantastic and still better in many ways.
		- its not too noisy  at least with this evo 4 even on high gain
		- After I started Granophyre I opened Fortin Cali in GB (granophyre didnt work :( ) and I ended up getting a useful tone somehow from two accidental instances of the plugin lol
- ===== Audient Evo 4
	- lol knob popped off as I was trying to get it out of the box.  no problem popped right back on solid ... well not like tightly but turns great
	- Ok its plugged in and the inputs seemed to work as expected.  I’m bummed that it only had a 1/4” headphone jack.  Thats just the littlest bit annoying for my purposes not a real issue though.
	- With amplitube it sounds like its slower and less reactive than neural it instantly feels different.  update: thats mostly because when you change interfaces it goes to default 512 samples, not a bug just means you have to set that back down and thats why it was slow and unresponsive feeliing at first.  Now that I fixed it again it feels great. 
	- I think this thing iis really warm and clear actually
- ===== Neural DSP Granophyre
	- out of the box same setup as the other one.
	- sound
		- out of the box nice deep but wooly and warm chunk
		- thrers no way to get a completly clean, thatts ok theres some nice cleans with some crisp on top
		- miid pickup vol dn nice meaty warm quackiish	
		- its real nice actually 
		- At high gain with lots of boost it gets real noisy but still sounds like an amp noisy
		- I freaking love the CHUNK in this!
		- I love the sag or the gooeyness of this amp.  The cali doesnt have that and I love it for what it is.  I dont even know if its always what I want but I love it iinstantly.  a chirp or chime or a dig 
		- I love how it sounds with the volume down too not clean but fun
	- PROBLEM using as a plugin.  it says it cant be used may need to be updated.  
	- Fortin Cali loaded in garageband just fine!?!
	- Maybe I can still record?  Maybe I can use loopback?
		- I had to make an account with arc (or so I gthought) and register my product but the serial number waas ‘already taken’ so I dont get any of their (admiittedlyy totallyy crappy and mostly already yfree) offers. 
		- There is a loopback mixer in the evo menu when the evvo software is running (when its not showing you ads) but it doesnt seem to do anything ... you cant reassign things I dont think.  I’m watchin ga video.
		- I want to monitor the granophyre in myy headphones, while also sneding the output to the loopback channels, and from there recording in garageband.  
		- Ok I think I got it partially working
		- Oh weird it said ‘disk too slow to record’ ... makes me want to back up my hard drive immediately.  
		- It works for this demonstration but isnt really workable long term.  There might be another audio interface which would let me do something like that
		- or maybe I could use the computer audio headphones to monitor the output of the granophyyre program, and let it send the other channel to garageband.
		- Oh interesting!  When I do three finger scrollinig I hear it in the sound coming out of the plugin.
		- The plugin can only output to two channels so it cant send to stereo headphones output and 
		- oh!  I can send plugini output to computer and then computer to loopback and then record the loopback?.  The loopback mixer you turn up the volume on the inputs that yyou want to send to the loopback output or something.  
		- I got it working so it plays great through the standalone app and records into garageband just fine.  I turned off input monitoring in gb ofc.  I made an aggregate device in midi settings but it didnt do anything different afaik.
		- I kind of fell in love with this one so I want to get the plugiin workingi if I can
		- After playing with Nolly for a minute I tried it again this time reinstallinig it in full (didnt uninstall because I didnt know how) and restarted and it didnt work in gb.  However I got a program calld hostingau and in that it worked great!  it was tricky to figure out that I had to use tracks d and e to set input an dhtne output but then it worked perfect.  It opened up and everyything.  I could possibly yrecord that way.
		- BUT there are some pplugin loaders like the one from bluecat and peavey that can host OTHER PLUGINS! I wonder if I could do that?
		- Try: Try getting a free plugin loader real quick?  Buy the bluecat pack real quick?  Try the peavey one real quick (usb stick) or maybe theres another 
		- Should I upgrade to Logic just for this?  Hell no.  I’m working Tom in Garageband not Logic.  And I dont need it for literally anything else other than this bug.

- ===== Element 
		- Looked around a lot and found this open source thing called Element which is a plugin wrapper.  Just tried it and Granophyre pops up inside it just fine.  
		- Had to build element from source.  It wasnt bad the instructions werent perfect but they’re not motivated to make them perfect.  The mac instructioins were incomplete but iif you just updpated the submodules using the linux command listed above the mac stuff then it built and ran without much trouble.
		- You have to right click in the window and then go to plugins unverified to get the Granophyre.  You have to go to the options menu and select the audio input and output devices.  THen you have to move things around on the graph (since some wilil accidentally ybe on top of others).  then you have to connect inputs and outputs.  Hover ovver the green dots to see its label.  You can use the patch bay in the vview menu to link things up a different way and it gives yyou tons of options on how to do taht which I think is really cool.  Just using this I might be able to make it work inside garageband by sppltiting the signal just right into an aggregated input or something.
		- How to make this into a plugin itself???  Not actually sure whether I loaded the vst or the au but it seems to work so it doesnt matter.  Looks like to do this you have to buy the full version where they’ve packaged up the software into an installer which also installs element as a plugin.  TO buy the full version is super cheap $2 or if you want continuous support $2/mo.  I just purchased the $2 and I can download the full version for a week.
		- I’m firing up garage band now ... hopefull it will be listed as a plugin?  YESSSS II didnt evven have to restart.  IT even has a bunch of inputs and outputs I presume that they represent tracks or something?  This is likely to work greaat
		- NOOOOOOOOoooooOOOOOoooooOOOOooooOOOooooo!!!!! When you run granophyre from within this plugin but also from within garageband ... it still doesnt work :( how sad.  
		- That I think is the last straw and although I love the tone, I will do without it.  
		- WAIT ... [this post at neural](https://unity.neuraldsp.com/t/problem-abasi-with-garageband/2069) says if yyou turn off gatekeeper it might work the abasi one might anyway ... 
		- SORT OF WORKED!! It DID work and I was able to run it in garageband but only while gatekeeper is disabled.  Is that how I want to run my system?
		- I tried removing acls lots of chmodding based on my mac note and none of it worked :(
		- an hour later I’m giving up (again).  I’m a bit mad at neural.  Its only garageband that doesnt work and apparently [apogee have the same problem only with garageband](https://apogeedigital.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056923214--Fatal-Error-and-Plugins-cannot-be-used-message-in-Garageband) and ilok anyway. 
		- Maybe I can route the audio just right with element?  Maybe this is how i would want to do it anyway???  This lets me record the track the first time the way I want it to sound instead of havving the dry siganl and processing it.  Thiis doestn prely on plugins so it would be compatible with Tom.  
			- In Element: Add the amp model you want, in Evo4 instrument 1 goes to your pllugins input.  your plugins output goes to loopback AND to evo 4 main output 1 and 2.  THEN in garageband it should be set to Audio Midi settings to evo 4 for both iniput and output and for the track set it to EVO3 (which is the loopback output) THEN in evvo loop back mixer (run the evo app and then its in the menu at the top) turn the loop back 1 2 to 0 volume level and it should work!  YEAH This works great actually!  The timing isnt evven off somehow!?!  In elemen tI also set sample rate to 96 and buffer size to 128
		- WOW this was all so worth it.  I just learned enormous about how to use element and you know what?  Now I can do basicallyy fucking anything even dual amping and everythiing and it doesnt even put any plugins IN garageband!!!
		- I quit element ... now I am going to load it up again  When I did there was kind of a perma overload but if I re wire it I bet it will work then. Hmm When I did the left channel worked but hte right didnt ... did I blow it up?  Did I ruin the evvo?   what is going on???
		- Update Apr 28.  I dont know how to send the tempo into the plugin to get good delay timings.  The plugin pedal has the tempo grayed out and doesnt seem that it can be changed.  Changinig it at the top left of element didnt send it into the plugin apparently. Ahh theres a sync switch on the delay pedal which ungreys the delay tempo. Then at least i can set it manually yto get it working.  However the SYNC button should totally sync it up with its host and in element that doesnt seem to be working.  That does work in garageband
		- lIttle bug in element: Click on the n in the top right.  Then try to get out of that menu withotu doing anything ini the menu.  I was only able to do that by clickinig power off on the top left.  
		- WHOA May 4 now all of a sudden even though thsi worked a few dayys ago it wont instantiate Neural DSP plugins anyyymore.  Amplitube works.  I think since I used them last I authenticated with ilok the full versions.  Last time they were still on the free versions.  This makes them much MUCH less useful and that is a frustrating and shitty part of the 'free trial' thats deceptive although I do not believe any maliciousness on the part of Neural DSP.  It doesnt work the same before the trial and after the trial.  it doesnt integrate with other apps before the trial and after the trial. Thats how it seems anyway.  I went to a lot of trouble during the trial period to get this workflow working so if that is what is going on then its ... frustrating? infuriating?  that it stopped working.  I dont see what else it could be.  
		- Now I'm trying to run it inside garageband and all of my plugins are MISSING from inside element.  It says you cant scan from inside the plugini version you have to scan from the app.  I have tons of pluginis in the app. I still appeased it and went and scanned and iti still didnt work. Let me restart
		- After restart:
			- Tryinig to use NOlly (like before) "Fatal Error 100000 A fatal wrapper boostrap error happened.  This software cannot be loaded.  Please contact the software publisher for support using thisi software." thats the apple level error box and then in the element error box "Plugin Instantiation failed   Archetype nolly could not be instantiated".  It did some of this several times during the scan too.  Isnt that the same error I had on granophyre from within garageband?
			- Theres a 11.3.1 big sur update that just popped up maybe I could install that 
			- Nolly and Cali still work as plugins and standalone apps.  
			- Maybe there is a way to route audio such that it goes from within element out to those apps and then back in?  or something?  grrr
			- Element 0.46.0 is up to date I checked for updates from within the app
			- STILL cant load plugins from within the plugin in garagebandd.
		
- ===== Neural DSP Archetype Nolly
	- made in 2019 so before the granophyre so I bet it will have the same plugini problem or worse.
	- INstalled perfect.  required some activation first and I dont recall that during the granophyre.  I didnt run the app first I ran the plugin first.  I installed ALL of the plugins too.  Its runnign now great.
	- Sounds awesome.  Cool presets.  Cool sounds right away.
	- nice harmonics, havent found the huge gain ones yet tho
	- Hot Rod Heaven sounds lovvely.  I might be making it up but I immediately think I like this one preset better than anything i found in fortin cali.
	- Liquid shred solves the problem of having liquid gain!  check!
	- Sounds really cool just going through the presets
	- Air Raid goes really heavy classic hard rock.
- ===== Green USB Cable
	- Cons: The noise is/can be terrible.  With a noise gate on it is ok.  This is not the kind of thing that anyone would choose to use professionally.  high gain without a good noise gate is completely unusable.    Cleans without a noise gate are usable.  Crunch can be usable.  The light should stop blinking when it is working or light up when there is a signal.  not sturdy.  Plugging direct into a computer the weight would torque the port pretty hard.  sort of needs a little extension of some kind for that reason.
	- Pros: its only fifteen freaking dollars.  There is no extra cable baggage.  It doesnt take up space.  it doesn’t make any cable spaghetti.  It feels nice.  Convenient for travel.  
	- Summary: Its not even the kind of thing that a hobbyist will choose to use long term.  I venture to say there is no one playing guitar for fun who will buy this and be satisfied with it long term such that they never choose to save up the roughly $100 to someday get something much much better, but ultimately it is fine to use and play with plugins, and get sounds easily quickly and without any mess around your laptop and get some actually good sounds and find the areas its weak and use those to learn what matters to you and help you eventually upgrade to something else but for now start effectivvely today making recording writing jamming with real fun music!  
- ===== Groundinig
	- touch the grounding cable If I run a groundinig cable to my hand and the guitar ccable by the input jack tons of the buzzing goes away.  A little of the buzzing goes away when i just touch my hand even if I’m not touching the guitar metal.  i put the cable on my ankle and then touch the guiitar and its super quiet.  Also touching the computer once i’m grounded makes the guitar quieter even if i’m not touching the guitar
	touching the computre even when I’m not grounded makes the guitar quieter too in the same wayy actually

Fell in love with the quad cortex.  Probably best to sell literally everything else.





Keep the zoom to be a looper maybe?  Would it work as just a looper and a wah pedal?  


1. Finish adjusting the nice prs action
6. Upload Ownhammer IRs into my cab sim



Simplest 1: 
1 quad cortex.  eq pedal on the desk, great looper and wah that effortlessly move to the ground (maybe a little pedalboard for just those two things)
What looper/wah?  Maybe the zoom that I have with an external expression pedal?  maybe even a sustain pedal? (Some have polarity switches)
Record into my laptop with a simple usb cable from the qc



Simplest 3:
Guitar -> s2 button Looper (zoom?) -> ABY -> L into pinnacle -> tube amp -> IR Cab Sim -> triangle speaker
d										 -> R into vypyr ->
d 								  





Roland DP10 as an external expression pedal


Next:
- ----------------------
- Get a good looper (decision fatigue) (Start with my zoom)
- Get a table to work on
- Get an ABY Pedal for going stereo



Mar 12

Simplest Options

I had preordered the new HXStompEX or whatever because it seemed to be the lowest baggage possible thing, however then I learned that garageband can do amps and cabs and plugins so ... I bought a cable.  That would be the super lowest baggage thing.
I cancelled the HXStomp.  The only thing about it was it wasnt uhh wah pedal.

Vypyr

I'm falling back in love with the peavey VYPYR.  the VIP1 has a built in USB interface and sounds so damn good recorded into garage band.  Its got quirks (pans hard left when you change fx lol)  And its got that footswitch  with 4 buttons and expression (and you can even get a huge footswitch with two expressions).  WHOA Apparentlyy the vypyr 30 also has USB record out!
I'm having more fun using garageband as a looper actually and its super easy to lay back on my couch with wireless trackball and keyboard.





 Mar 14 2021
 
 I like the Peavey Vypyr and I like that its like permanent and wont fall over and is super stable like that, and I've got a wah (Well when I have the fx set there anyway) however ... the options are limited, the looper doesnt work on teh 30 but its got all of the options but its 
1. Vypyr VIP1 (limited fx options, a little bit of noise (annoying), clumsy with the LR, support is limited, not really kept up to date, software is limited and untrustworthy ) (wah, already here, love the tone, it really sings, noise is not problematic. super lightweight, not as stable as the 30, USB Recording)
1. Vypyr 30 (heavy, big, wah firmware problem burned me a little, support is limited, not really kept up to date, software is limited and untrustworthy,) (stable and solid as a rock, lots of fx options, wah, USB recording out)
1. Zoom ((doesnt sing in high gain as much as the vypyr the wayy its currently set), not enuogh fx options) (super light, great clean, really good high gain, lots of FX options, can be used with the software )
1. ------
1. I like the idea of having a super lightweight device on the floor with an easy power plug and solid USB interface and all wiring easy to plug in and with very low noise.
1. I like the idea of having super low noise rig no matter what
1. I like the idea of having controls over the guitar fx controllable from the computer


1. Amp with built in interface and clear cabling and laptop controllable (MAC) and wah
	1. $149 Fender Mustang LT25 (No wah, mac compatible?, )
	2. $349 Boss Katana Head
	2. $249 Boss Katana 50 26lbs
	3. $129 Blackstar ID:core 10 (Sends DI signal too!  can re-amp later, no mac software)
	4. $799 Yamaha dual head?
1. Just a somehow super quiet interface and plugins
	1. Might have to test a bunch.
	1. Might have to pay $600 (at that point I could get the helix)
1. Floor modeller with wah and clear cabling and laptop controllable (MAC)
	1. $150 NuX MG300 (reamp or dry out, wah, software works with mac) (yes)
	1. $499 HX Stomp (mac hx edit, record direct signal) (yes)
	1. $750 HX Stomp XL (2 more blocks, mac hx edit, record direct signal ) (yes)
	1. $599 Zoom G11
	1. $330 Zoom G5
1. Desk modeller with wah and clear cabling and laptop controllable (MAC)
	1. $299 Boss GT001 (Dual Amps, expression, Mac SW, External or bus power, Midi pickup, last gen dsp not as good) (no)
	1. $699 BossGT1000core (Dual Amps, Better software, mac sw works, external power) (yes)
	2. $89 Zoom GCE3 (No wah, Mac SW (confirmed), multi power, 1-2channels) (yes)
	2. $89 Nux Mighty Plug (yes)
1. Tube Amp into super quiet interface 


Do not need
1. Looper
2. Footswitches

Want
Downloadable Amp Profiles sounds like tons of fun
At least downloadable presets sounds like fun

1. Vypyr not laptop controllable but I could setup presets and switch with the footswitch and use wah that way and that would be all I need


Mar 15 2021


Dont care so much about:
1. Looper
1. Footswitches
1. Cost


Require:
1. Compatible with Mac Big Sur
1. USB audio interface
1. Dual Amp

Desire:
1. 4 channel audio interface 
1. dry signal on audio interface
1. Wah
1. Super Quiet audio interface so I can use high gain plugins


Possible Form Factors:
1. Tiny size to be able to mount on desk with laptop
1. Medium Size desktop or floor, eye level on rolling rack, easy button presses
1. Small-medium amp size so it will never tip
1. Small floor processor with built in wah but controllable from the computer
1. Super lightweight amp size so I can easily carry it around


Ideals
1. Compatible with M1 macs (or likely will soon)



Mar 16 2021
Yesterday I made a spreadsheet that is helping me get this all through my head

1. I like the idea of having two different small amps in parallel into an interface or two interfaces: one which has clear clickable presets (vypyr perhaps?) and ideally another which has a cool mac software configuration.
	1. Advantages: It would be a super clear and solid and low baggage solution from an investment perspective.  They are easily replaceable and not that valuable so I can ditch them if necessary.
	2. Disadvantages: I would be tethered to that spot for recording (maybe thats ok since there aren't like lots of places to go in here anyway). 
2. I like the idea of having two tiny under desk sized amps like headphone amps and running them in parallel
	1. Advantages:  Almost zero investment baggage.  Could get cool tones.  
	2. Disadvantages: Kind of a clumsy arrangement.  Preset synchronization done manually.  
3. I like the idea of having just one device and selling everything else
	1. Advantages: Lowest possible baggage
	2. Disadvantages: Cost.  Not sure which one since there are disadvantages to each.  
4. I like the idea of using the amps I have here in parallel
	1. Advantages: No cost.  Start today (almost).  Honestly great tones and responsive
	2. Disadvantages: Complexity of setup.  Inflexibility of setup.  
5. I like the idea of several amps or amp sims on a rack or table or floor
	1. Advantages: Loads of flexibility.  Relatively low baggage.
	2. Disadvantages: Cable baggage.  Complexity of interface.  
6. I like the idea of having an epic unit on a rack so I can twiddle with the dials with a little floorboard pedal 


	
Start with $300 for an interface and $100 for an ABY
- $900-1200 Option: (Atomic Amplifire or BluGuitar Amp1 or H&K Tube amp or Laney IRT Pulse) in parallel with both into an interface (Boss GT001)
- $100 for accessories for hooking up (Vypyr VIP1, Vypyr 30, Cube 30, H&K Tube, Zoom G1xfour, Pinnacle, Cab Sim, HotTone Eagles Heart, Joyo American Sound, Behringer Vintage monster)
- $150 for (Vypyr VIP1, Vypyr 30, Cube 30, Mustang, Blackstar )
- TODO test phone with guitar and irig in the car away from our apartment with garage band then in livingroom to see if theres a diff.
- $350 for (Boss Pocket GT, NuX Mighty Plug, Fender Micro Mustang) 
- TODO test recording with Cristis mac.  
- TODO Test recording with my windows and then sending to the mac.  
- TODO Check Peavey headphone jack far away from electricity for the same hum/whine
- TODO Get a shielded cable
- TODO Test the Vypyr 30

Top Tones in 2021:

2. Neural DSP Plugins


How to make any amp sound good when testing it out: 1. Tune up really well.  2. Come with a set of riffs and just play those.  Famous youtubers can noodle and keep it always interesting, but for starters learn a few riffs (even super simple) that are fun and musical and easy for you to play they do not have to be from records or they could be similar to a famous recorded riff.
