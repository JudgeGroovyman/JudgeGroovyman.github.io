## Great tones and Solid State vs Tube ## 
- The best comparison of Solid State v Tubes is at 13:00 [AB Fender Twin vs AMT F1 Pedal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=927&v=rCkuJ2goPds)
- Heres a good comparison of [Fender Blues Deluxe vs Peavey's TransTube Bandit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX9su1L-JAE) and even if you get the blind test right theres no denying they both sound fantastic

Quotes

- Piranha - [Hey talks about quality amps having a harmonic ringing and this one does](https://youtu.be/2TTDflrZwKM?t=394) he gets harmonic overtones in his headphones because it adds a harmonic character that is really only found in the old classic fenders and vox amps.  14m0s:'They're ringing like a bell'
- Piranha - high gain tone is good, combined with another amp its good, Reviews aren't universally complimentary
- Micro Dark "what if I tried using the effects loop on the Micro Dark amp...so I ran the send output to the input of the pedal board, and the output of the pedal board to the return input on the MD...HUGE DIFFERENCE !! The effects all sound soooo much better and the guitar has it's nice clean tone back minus the distortion !! ... I just not enjoying it, I'm loving it !! The Micro Dark with the G12T-75 Celestion speaker in the Marshall cabinet has taken over my home studio. I'm getting so many great tones, at all volume levels. Great distortions, great cleans...sounds great at very low volume too !! This set up is just working out so well for me, and now the effect pedals I have sound better than ever. "
- Mark 5 "The Mark V head is brilliant, but there's almost too many options. I can get such good cleans with reverb I sold my Silverface Princeton Reverb, the only thing I miss is the bias trem. Does it sound exactly BF clean? No. But it sounds great, and it gets tones from the other channel a SF/BF Fender never will. Plus the footswitchable contour control works good - set it on noon, at gig volumes you get singing sustain on the edge of controllable feedback. I can use it in my old-fashioned dance band with my 335 and Gretsch, or the modern band with PRS Custom and Strat. It does everything with the 2-mode channels, and you only need to tweak gain and treble slightly - if you're au fait with the Boogie 'set the gain and treble right' it' childsplay getting good tones. "

Other Options
1. Any regular tube amp with a tube preamp stage and FX loop and just run that preamp signal out to an amp sim pedal or speaker emulator or IR Power Amp Simulator or something and experiment to figure out what sounds good. (this is pretty high baggage)
2. Attenuator between the power amp and speaker of a regular tube amp (this is pretty high baggage) (See attenuator section)
3. Tube Headphone Amp
4. Tube Preamp
5. Tube Amp Sim Pedal or FX

## Details ##
- 6505/5150 "Also, the effects loop has a poorly-designed buffer that robs all your low-end and adds fizz whenever you're using the loop (it even does this if you simply run a patch cable from send to return.) Eventually, you'll want to use the loop for delay, reverb, etc. It is a very simple fix, but you've got to be somewhat proficient with a soldering iron. It involves soldering a capacitor to the legs of a resistor just behind the effects loop "send" jack. Peavey endorses this fix. Anyway, it took me about 10 minutes to do it, and the sound is now the same whether the effects loop is used or not.   The big reason to do that is so you can run an EQ pedal in the effects loop. That is the most important upgrade to any 5150/6505, IMO. If you thought the amp crushed before doing so -- wait until you try it with an EQ."

## Quotes ##
- Super Champ "I've had both and I can assure you, after Fuse adjustment, the X2 is alot better. I don't know why Fender ships the amp with everything on 10 and you have to adj. it out, but it does sound alot better. The bass response is huge compared to the Xd. The XD is a little louder in the low volume range, the X2 takes over in the high volume range. The line out on the X2 is much better too."
- Super Champ "Yes, the X2 amazed me, after changing different cabs models within fuse, how much bass can be had. Fuse is very, very easy. It doesn't require much skill. You can adj. it exclusively for your guitar. That separates the X2 from the Xd."

- Quitler "It took the pedals like a dream, it responded to my pick attack and expression like a dream"
- Quilter "if I wasn’t so fussy (I am, extremely) I would probably use it for every gig as let’s face it, the people listening wouldn’t be able to tell the difference"
- Quilter "when the Bravado isn’t here I use a Fender BDri as my main gigging amp… well, I used to, as if the Bravado isn’t here, from here on in I’ll be using the Quilter"

## Quotes ##
- Mustang "Try a Mustang III v2 with just a touch of gain on the Fender Super Sonic emulation. You'll never go back to tubes!"
- Mustang Unfortunately FUSE is dead now
- Yamaha THR10X Settings at the end of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLmKK5p9E80)
- Vypyr Sanpera Pedal "you'll notice some people complain that there's a time lag when they switch presets. The switch engages as you're picking up your foot, not as you're stepping down on it. Thus, it will not engage until your foot comes off. Step on it a little early if you must and lift your foot off the second you need the switch to occur. Simple as that!"
- Vypyr Sanpera Pedal "The only thing you might have to do to it is adjust the sensitivity of the expression pedal switches, so you won't have to step so hard on it to engage something like the wah-function. But there's a couple youtube videos on how to do that and they're pretty good. It's not hard, at all. It's more to adjust it according to what works for you, since you don't want it too easy, either."
- Vypyr Sanpera Pedal - Theres a mod to drill the rubber under the Expression pedal to make it softer and make the clicking better.  Theres an official mod to open it up and adjust a screw 1/4 turn on a white plate to make it click easier or harder which looks super easy.  Theres a problem with the looper volume with my amp and apparently when you update the firmware in my amp it fixes that problem.  Making these mods and then setting the amp up with some great presets would be a valuable service.
- Katana "No matter what sneakey amp or whatever knob positions i found it to be fatiguing for my ears. At the end of a 3-4 hour jam my ears and brain were exhausted. Does not happen with my main amp."
- Katana/GT1 "Set the boss GT output to small combo, set the katana amp on clean and as flat as possible, and use the GT as a modeler and effects on one and you'll get killer tones.  ... t/s rep at Boss said that the modeling/effects were the same, but those in the Katana had been tuned to the speaker cabinet"
- Katana Sneaky Amps "Katana's additional amps and effects, (some call sneaky amps) are accessible using the non-boss software KATANAFxFloorBoard."
- Katana not GT100 "I had a Gt100 for a couple years and I could not make amp models work for me all that time, direct to the board or through effects loop return on my amp with cab modeling bypassed. I connected effects loop send of my katana head to the same amps effects return and it was thick, creamy, punchy, alive.. so according to my observations, it's not. Maybe modeling part shares some guts but there is something more going on with Boss now."
- Katana - That Pedal Show during their wet dry videos talk about the inherent tiny delay in the katana and all other digital amps.  Its not noticeable to the ear on its own (note: I believe it is noticeable to the brain and thats 75% of the reason tubes are considered better is their instantaneous response to the fingers) but its noticeable when you get to working in stereo with other non delayed amps

# Preamps #

Actual Preamps: According to [Why You Need A Preamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVbceQGhbdM&t=641) preamp pedals are only the ones which tone shape but stay crystal clean.  Thats interesting but not what follows here, but perhaps it would be beneficial to put one in front of these tones to add definition and clarity.  

Boost: This might be related to Pete Thorns [Treble Boosters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQFdP6PaKTk) or his [5 Pedals for Boosting your amp Tone Secrets #4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMjXLrFCOuU)

### Quotes ###
- IRT Pulse - [How to setup Pulse on Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueVF52HDNNE) "To set up the Pulse on Macs: You have to create an aggregate I/O using “Audio MIDI Set Up.”  You have to use different devices for the inputs and outputs. I used a USB Audio CODEC with two inputs and used my Focusrite as the output.  Whatever you name your new aggregate, insure your DAW is set for it. Heres the Apple support page that shows you how easy it is to create the aggregate.  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202000"
- IRT Pulse - [Great Clean Tones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueVF52HDNNE)
- Preamp Pedals [This Guy](https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/cab-sim-and-preamp-pedals-query.1989739/#post-27546321) shares an interesting perspective on replacing the tube power amp (or in this case not)
- Bulava "just finished my board and tried running a Tech 21 OMG (from an RK5) distortion into the Bulava. It sounded awesome. ... I really like the clean, too."   " thrilled to report that the AMT SS-20 works fantastically well as a pedal platform. Both my Rockett The Dude and MI Audio Crunchbox (only pedals I have lying around at the moment) sound massive through the AMT clean channel into an ADA GCS-3 cab sim"
- AMT Other Pedals F1(Fender) also: B1 (Bogner), R1(Mesa), E2(Engl), D1(Diezel), S1(Soldano), P1(5150), M1(Marshall), C2(Cornford), some are cheaper than others, 
- Ethos "you could always step up to the Ethos, killer clean tone AND a great OD tone as well"
- AMT "the pedal (P1) sounds excellent imo. It feels and sounds like I'm playing through an amp instead of a pedal (it goes through an EHX magnum and a bogner cube). What's also amazing about it is it cleans up real well when you roll your guitar's volume down. If you're thinking about getting the P1, I would go ahead and get the P2 instead. The difference between the 1 series and the 2 series is that the 2 has a clean channel when switched off, but that also makes it a non true bypass. Another downside is the clean has a fixed eq since the eq controls are assigned to the gain channel only. But on the flip side, the clean channel sounds like a nice fender and doesn't really need to be eq'd.  You should also consider the S2 as it sounds like the P1 boosted with a tube screamer - tight. The E1 I don't like much because to my ears it's lacking some low end."
- EHX 2ube "2ube with couple old RCA 12au7 has been my most used pedal for years, actually have 2 of them.   After drives as a dual tube splitter to drive stereo effects after them. You can switch it to line level if your driving FRFR speakers that want line level input or instrument if driving guitar amps. If your running wet/dry you can dial up some extra OD on the dry side if desired.  Or plug your guitar into 2ube 1 then out to your other drive pedals in loop then back to 2ube 2 as output tube buffer. Like this your guitars plugged right into a tube preamp, acts like it too, reacts very dynamically to vol roll offs and pick attack. It's a input buffer with both drive and vol adjustments. Like your cleans with a little hair on them, it can do it on that drive knob then vol knob can reign it in so its not OD input of next pedal.  So many ways you can configure this pedal. I even use it as stereo OD after synths. Old 12au7 and 12ay7 are its mojo tubes, dump the stock 12ax7wb, their awful in this pedal."

#### About the Mesa Boogie VTwin ####
- Apparently [hard to find in great working condition](https://youtu.be/ObrzKKxZaLc?t=225)
- Then again heres a contrary opinion that [they are reliable](https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/mesa-v-twin-praise.516842/)
- [About the V Twin](https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/mesa-v-twin-praise.516842/): "I love mine. I have tried to replace it with a smaller, battery-powered pedal, but without success (Catalinbread SCOD, Fulltone OCD, Keeley Metal Zone, Mad Professor MRD, MI Audio Crunch Box, Subdecay Blackstar, Vox Satchurator, and I forget what else). Everything I have tried, even if it sounds good on its own, pales in comparison to the massive tone of the V-Twin."
- [Not only overdrive]() "I used it not only as a distortion/overdrive generator in front of an amp, but also as a preamp straight into a recording deck."
- "I foolishly sold it when I bought a Mark 1 reissue because I thought I would have the "Mesa sound" covered with that amp."
- "I use one for practice direct to board. The magic ingredient for me is running a TS type pedal in front of it. It really tightens up the sound a lot. I recnt;y tried a few othee OD's in front but the TS is the only one that seems to work."
- "it's warmer and smoother than any Recto I've heard"
- "Its one of the best high gain pedals out. I wish I hadn't sold mine, its was built like a tank!"
- "An Xotic RC Booster sounds very good in front of the V Twin. If you are using humbukers , you can drive the hell out of it. It screams. very thick saturated OD. I like it best in front of a clean amp just on the verge of break up."
- "2 days ago I took it out of the recording setup and plugged it into the power amp junction (under the chassis) of my MBMKIIB combo loaded with Yellow Jackets in Triode mode and an EVM12L. I set the vtwin on the right side channel mode 2 with the gain up about 1/3 to 1/2 way. This gives a slight breakup. Nice warm sound. Push the master up and you start getting into power tube distortion. Sweet. Then I stepped on my OCDv4. Holy #$^& ! Here's the tone I've been searching for all my life. I can't stop playing. I haven't been this inspired in a long time. Turning off the OCD and switching on the BoR gave another inspiring tone. All of the sudden all my pedals sound freakin awesome! I hope the second honeymoon I'm on with the Vtwin never ends.:JAM"
- "The clean channel, however, takes pedals just like a good tube amp, so I mainly use it with headphones, in the wee, small hours before sunrise.."
- "It's that latency issue that really bugs me. I could never get used to that moment of dead silence in a live setting, so it was relegated to the studio"
- "I suse the V Twin for metal. If your un an MXR Six Band Eq after the VTwin you get incredible tone sahping options with a boost in louness, more headroom. Sounds amazing. High gain boogie tones all the way. I also run a Creations Audio Lab MK.4.23 before it, kick it for leads and I get more gain with no sound coloration. "
- "The VTwin is hands down the best Overdrive/Distorion pedal ever built (IMO). Cant understand why Mesa doent make them anymore. Im glad I got one."
- "After all these years and thousands of dollars spent on gear, my V-Twin is still my favorite pedal by far ... I have tried to replace the V-Twin with something smaller and battery powered, but it just cannot be done. Nothing has the massive low end, tone-ful girth, and easy playability of the mighty V-Twin."
- Fix for the delay "there is the irritating sound cutoff when you switch from the v-twin to bypass ... External Bypass switch, the problem is only around when you use the onboard one. Any 1 -button/2 setting footswitchshould work, there´s a jack on the backside for it ... so by using the external switcing outputs, theres no sound loss when bypassing? hmm, interesting, thanks!  ... I´m assuming you mean the "dropout" when switching, and yes, an external switch aleviates the problem.  .. now when i switch from the v-twin to bypass, there is no loss in sounds, but vise versa, the sounds cuts out for a second. ... Stick a 1 megaohm resistor between the ground and signal and your set."

#### Behringer Vintage Tube Monster V999 ####
- "I've bought and then sold lots and lots of pedals. ... With the VT-999 this may be as close as I've gotten to a Marshall in a Box tone so I'm pretty pleased. Oh, a tube screamer is icing on the cake to give your tone extra punch."
- "This pedal need bow it's metaphorical head to no one.  this paddle gives you the gain stage of a hot rodded Marshall amplifier. (Tonally) Pick your poison, be it NWOBHM, Ozzy Era Zakk Wylde, Randy Rhoads and dozens of other tones that made heavy metal great. You will find it."
- "If you dial it down, you can play anything, blues to jazz to classic rock, and very low gain settings it serves to fantastically just warm up the signal of a clean guitar"
- "if you're a guitarist just starting out, and you want to distortion pedal that'll do anything you need it to, look no further.  If you're a pro, and you're looking for another color for your Distortion palette, this one deserves a place among the pantheon of the gods.  If you have an amplifier that has a fantastic clean tone but just doesn't bring the fire when it's time to turn up the heat, this one can bring Hell.  I've said a lot, but I still don't feel that I've said enough.  Just buy the damn thing."
- "I wish I had ordered it sooner.  Out of the box this thing is a beast."
- " if you get a noisy one it is not the design, exchange it for a good one. If you get one with a noise problem it is defective. Exchange it for another and you will like it."
- "This pedal literally cracks me up. I've spent upwards of $300 on real tube pedals, and not happy with the tone on most. ... After 10 minutes, I pulled out my box of JJ's ECC83s. Popped that in, and laughed all the way to the fridge for another beer after hearing a nice smooth tube OD!"
- "opens up with 9v center neg 500mV 1A power supply"
- "unless you're after a real saturated metal distortion...a very low gain works best. It'll still OD a lot with a 12AU7, but you get a wider scope of clean to dirt with the low gain tube.  A better 12AX7 gain rating 100% 5751, and exact match to a 12AX7 with a gain rating of 70% 12AT7 gain rating 60% 12AY7 gain rating 45% 12AV7 gain rating 41% 12AU7 gain rating 19%  All of the tubes sounded MUCH better than the stock....but the 12AU7 gave the wide scope of overdrive and a fuller tone that responded the best to the tone controls.  any decent tube from Tung Sol, JJ...etc will work."
- "The build quality is great, but the tube overdrive was missing the bottom end and clear not muddy distortion. So I got an electro Harmonix 12AX7E electron tube and it made a world of a difference!"

The best explanation of why pedals matter is in [this boost video by Pete Thorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMjXLrFCOuU), especially listen to him rip with and without the pedal at 4:30.

### Giving Life ###
There are a class of pedals which boost in just the right way that it makes a clean tone come alive.  These are the kind of pedals that might stay always on and you would really miss if you turned it off.
- EP Boost on 0 ([Talked about in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XGvRAQ0HeA&t=9m45s), )
- Mojo Mojo on 0 Always on Paul Gilbert [Beginning of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5J8R2S3BZw)
- Simble Predriver (Preamp/Booster/Compressor) (Good candidate for an always on magic pedal) [Pete Thorns Review](https://youtu.be/N8zzvVmyzIw?t=117)
- Clover [More about this pedal](https://youtu.be/SVbceQGhbdM?t=203)


### Treble Boosters ###
- "Never played a Rangemaster but I own a Naga Viper ... My Mesa sounds amazing until I hit that pedal, and then its really magical"
- Find them cheap by looking for naga clone or or beano clone or rangemaster clone or treble booster or java boost clone on reverb

### Overdrives ###
- Pinnacle (its an amp in a pedal designed to be used into a clean high headroom amp to emulate a hot rodded marshall)
- Simble (Dumble)
- Euphoria (Dumble)
- Ethos blew my mind in a video
- Fender Pugilist Distortion $119 (stacked overdrive)
- Blackstar HT-Boost (150, Two extra hot tube stages)
- Fuchs Plush Valve Job (260)
- $100 Blackstar HT-Dual or HT-Dist or HT-Boost or HT-Drive or HT-Metal or HT-DistX (High Quality Tube Overdrives, speaker sim out)
- $150 JHS Andy Timmons Signature Channel Drive

Interesting to review the variety of dumble pedals available on reverb.  Same review for brown sound pedals

### Quotes ###
- AxeFX2 "I have had a number of guitar amp modellers - line 6, eleven rack, software etc. back then, guitar recordings were always a chore, and never, ever a great sound. I rarely played guitar for enjoyment - just played because I was recording a song.  Now - I have the axe fx. I find myself sitting in the studio four hours on end, playing guitar...just for fun. I try a sound and it gives me an idea, and I play....all of a sudden, the sun is coming up! I've had the axe fx ii for over a year now and the unit, fractals support and customer focus is light years ahead of anything out there. I cannot say it strongly enough - you may be partially happy with other units, but the axe fx gives you ideas and motivates you to play."
- AxeFX2 "There is no alternative!  There are however devices one can settle on but you will never be totally happy and always wonder what it would have been like to have the real thing"
- Kemper Full 30s looper in pedalboard making it fully functional, use Michael Britt profiles
- To get Kemper profiles:  In addition to Michael Britt there’s a great rundown at just before 5min in this video: https://youtu.be/bHtV4YbBWSU
- Kemper [how to use the Kemper](https://youtu.be/GBvOP-29yCw) "Kemper has more of an amp-y quality to it."  "Its like pulling into a warehouse full of thousands of amps and cabinets and you can just find the one you want, plug into it, and go" 
- AxeFX3 "This sounds more like a  pristene clean, they sound more like what you would get in the studio when you've compressed and EQd them to fit into a mix better"
- In [this comparison between AxeFX and Kemper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBvOP-29yCw) I preferred the AxeFX

# Headphones & Monitors #

Probably worth getting really good headphones in this case.  Personally I want the solid feeling of the headphones being glued to my head and due to my head and my hair many headphones slip right off when I move around at all which makes them unusable for playing guitar so I don't want the ear cups to rotate sideways at all (because they slip off my head) and I don't really want them rotating up and down either.  I also don't want a detachable cable even though thats all the rage these days I realize that its got its practical purposes and that lots of other people want it that way.  I don't like them collapsing or folding since then its one more step to put them on (grabbing with both hands to unfold and pull apart).  If they are too large they will just slip off.

My Needs:
- No rotation
- No collapsing or folding 
- Straight Cable
- Not Detachable Cable
- Ideally over ear
- Not too loose 


## Headphone Notes ##
Ideal characteristics 
1. Sexy / Classy
2. Unbelievable shimmery spongy clean tones
3. Speaker Sim Headphone Out
4. Raw Line Out
5. Aux In

### No for various reasons ### 
- $127 Audiotechnica ATH-M50x (Collapsible and foldable)
- $80 Sony MDR7506 (Folding, coiled cable)

### Should work ###
- $134 Beyerdynamic DT-770 (32 Ohm, 80 Ohm, 250 Ohm models)
- $49 Audio-Technica ATH-M20x (Rotate a bit vertically)
- $68 AKG K240STUDIO (Detachable cable? Locked)
- $38 [Samson That I have right now](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LBSEQS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 
- $49 CAD Audio MH210 45mm (rotates vertically)
- $37 Superlux HD-681 (reviews aren't ideal)
- $40 Superlux HD-681 EVO (detachable cable, white or black)
- $40 Superlux HD668B 

These headphones work pretty well:


Here are some other options that might meet my needs:
- LyxPro HAS-10
- AKG K240STUDIO (these look yummy)
- Audio-Technica ATH-M20x

## Monitors ##
Computer speakers work ok.

### Quotes ###
- "for heads the H and K clean tone is beautiful. Crystal clear and the little 5 watt head isnt too pricey and will give you bedroom cleans. the Blackstar stuff is probably also worth a look. ... HT 5 Clean I like, think the cleans on the Hughes and Kettner if you are using it as a dedicated clean amp are better than blackstars though" [Rob Chapman Forum](https://www.robchapman.tv/forum/threads/best-small-tube-head-for-clean-tone.33759/page-2)
- "If you like the sound of a Fender champ then you'll love the cleans of the VHT Special 6. The cleans are nothing like a Fender tweed. The cleans are more like a BF champ, on steroids. The Special 6 is a bit on the bright side but manageable. These amps also take OD pedals very well."  [Convince me to buy a VHT](https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/vht-special-6-cleans.1324893/))
- For the VHT Special 6 [They released the schematic](http://chasingtone.com/yourguitaramp/youramp-reviews/vht-special-6-review/))
- Mesa "I've read many a time that a Mesa Mark I has the best Blackface clean sound out there. Original or reissue in a head" ... "Mesa Boogie specifically the Mark 2A (the best cleans of the Mark Series) Twin like cleans all day, but even tighter/more focused"
- "And I have this to say - NOTHING sounds like a good Twin Reverb with JBL's. ... You say what you say because you've never played a FYD or SMS rackmounted TR preamp into a McIntosh MC50 or Carvin DCM200L into a pair of SSP 1X12 cabs loaded, of course, with JBLs. Not only would they sound quite like a good TR - actually, I'll argue better - but you'd be able to bring them to gigs and use them at any volume level"
- "Morgan RV40 is spectacular, sounds killer through my 4x12 with a H30/V30 too. It's quickly becoming my favorite clean amp"
- "For big power BF cleans, a Showman....for less power a Bandmaster...if you like the Bandmaster but you want something spongier and more compressed still, a Tremolux. Those are the BF era Fender heads with the classic AB/AA763 preamp circuit (same as was used in the Twin Reverb and the Deluxe Reverb). No reverb though. Can't really go wrong with any of 'em if you're looking for classic BF Fender 6L6GC cleans in a head. And they're relatively inexpensive to boot!"
- Bassbreaker: Problem with FX Loop Hum "first run (2017) has a faulty effects loop - both heads and combos .. Any Fender repair will fix the loop with a factor kit, at no charge to you. the fix is quick and at no charge to the consumer. ... the updated ones will have a plastic fx send jack, if it's all metal it has not been updated! "
- Bassbreaker: "If you need an amp that is squeaky squeaky clean for fuzz, od, distortion, you might want to look somewhere else.  ... It is a real rock and roll amplifier.  Its single ended so you can drive it really hard, ... but you will have to master the art of manipulating the guitars volume and tone controls to regulate the amount of gain that you want from the amplifier.  I love playing in that fashion.  I think its liberating going with just a single cable right into an amplifier like this that is really cooking and make it through that show.  " [From Some Love for the Fender Bassbreaker 007](https://youtu.be/sSFWjAnkd5A?t=442)
- Bassbreaker: "To sound bigger with this amp, put the volume at 3 o'clock, the gain at the minimum and use a good fuzz or overdrive pedal for your dirt. "  Thats a good tip for a lot of amps. Volume high, gain low, boosts in front

# Attenuators and Speaker Sims #
If you power up a traditional tube amp, and pull out the speaker cable, you can destroy your tube amp because a tube power section requires the resistance provided by the speaker.  You or an amp manufacturer can use an 'attenuator' or 'dummy load' to electrically take the place of a speaker.  'Attenuation' is an electrical term which in physics means 'a loss of intensity' so an attenuator lowers the intensity of the amps signal and can provide the resistance necessary to run the amp quietly or silently while not burning out the power section of a tube power amp.  Typically the attenuator will have a line level signal coming out of it which is the same as the signal that was going to go to the speaker only quieter.  This works just fine electrically however there are two caveats: 
1.  Each speaker (and cabinet) has its own characteristics which add color to the sound.  The sound you would have heard out of the speaker will be inherently different than the sound you will hear from the line out since the line out will not have been affected by the characteristics of the speaker (some say the speaker and cab are 50% of your tone).  The simple solution to this is to plug the line out into something called a 'speaker sim' aka 'cabinet sim' aka 'cab sim' which will simulate the color of some speaker and or speaker cabinet. 
2.  When the signal exits the power amp the speaker doesnt merely accept it and play the signal, the speakers resistance pushes back against the power amp to varying degrees such that the power amp has to push the sound into and through the speaker and receives impulse responses back from the speaker and some of the valueable tones we hear when playing a tube amp are a result of the interactions between the power amp and the speaker.  The responses actually improve the tone and simulating those impulse responses is a part of the latest attentuators and the best sounding speaker simulators.

- This [video of Pat Quilter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAEdc1l-t6g) shows with an oscilliscope the difference between using an actual speaker and a dummy (resistive) load. 
- This video shows what [a difference a speaker simulator makes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=138&v=l818I0TXcmM) by playing a signal with and without a speker simulator.

3. [Diff Cab Sims](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLDFYsN_BR4)


## FX Loop Attenuators ##
Find new tones and dial in more usable tones, zero has no volume but 1 or 2 is MUCH too loud expands your amps range of volume.
1. Carls Custom Volume Box $24 (FX Loop Attenuator)
2. JHS Little Black Box $45 (FX Loop Attenuator)


## Impedances ##
1. Speakers: 4-16 Ohms
2. Headphones: 25-300 Ohms
3. DJ Headphones: 27-70 Ohms

Headphones with low impedance (<25Ohms) require little power to deliver high audio levels however are more susceptable to blowouts when using more powerful amplifiers.  Headphones with higher impedance demand more power to deliver high audio levels but as a result are protected from damage from overloading.

## Impulse Responses (IRs) ##
- https://www.ownhammer.com/store/
- Celestion makes some of the best
- [Some good free ones](https://www.redwirez.com/free1960g12m25s.jsp) which is demoed [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jugofWFouLE)

# Pedals #


### MIDI Footswitch ###
- Some FX Units can respond to midi signals and if they can I can make my own Footswitch that uses MIDI over USB or just MIDI to do anything I want!   
- [The first clue about using a home made midi footswitch with Zoom MS50G](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/99bv2d/question_looking_for_a_good_tube_amp_for_bedroom/e4mnaag/)
- Behringer MIDI Foot Controller FCB1010 "If you get the chip, make sure you specify the version with smooth CCs on the pedals. The original behringer software is very crude at the bottom of the pedal travel. The regular UNO emulates this - but there is an UNO version that ‘corrects’ this nonsense and supplies a nice smooth CC output from bottom to top." This can apparently work pretty well with the Kemper. Behringer MidiPedalboard with Uno for Kemper can work too for cheaper.
- For HX Stomp check out [this MIDI Pedal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db6JQp46QYI)

## Small Amp Sims ##
- Joyo American Sound (the one I have)
- Behringer GDI21 V-Tone $30 (1/4" and XLR Out, this is like that Behringer Amp that I had which sounded so fucking fantastic)

## Other Cool Pedals##
- TC Electronic MIMIQ $60-120 (Double or Triple Track your Guitar sound, stereo ) 
- EHX Freeze (lets you sustain a note) [Tricks to use this pedal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjFth1mg5Rc)


## Ambiance ##
- Boss RV3 Reverb + Delay
- Any small FX pedal would have these two FX in it

## Drums ##
- Digitech Trio (whole band in a pedal)

## Cool pedal companies ##
- Wampler (love the pedals, don't like the guy)
- JHS pedal products have my respect
- Baroni-Lab
- AMT

# Investigate #
Investigate for headphone use, tube monitoring, footswitch, etc.
1. Blackstar Fly (a mini amp like katana mini)
3. Vox air amp
4. Marshall DSLHR 1W
5. Cleaning pedal and amp power (google cleaning ac power from wall)
6. Line 6 Amplifi


# Loopers #
- Elecroharmonix
- TC Wiretap Riff Recorder (Sync with iphone, 8hrs on pedal, tap to record)
- "If I could travel backward in time to meet my younger self... I'd bring a Ditto Looper and say, 'Practice with this pedal. It will help your playing enormously, and you'll have a great time." - Paul Gilbert

# Shelves #
Ideally 19.5Wx10Hx12D


### Needs ###
Would like the top shelf to be 40-44" tall so I can tweak that one and the ones below it too
< 22" wide to fit in the closet door
Ideally <10"deep to fit just in front of my other amp and still close the closet door

Closet is probably 24" across, but the door opening would clear 22" just barely

## Shelves I bought ##
4 shelves
Could accomodate 19.5Wx10Hx12D


|-----4-----|
|10H		|
|19.5W		|
|-----3-----|
|10H		|
|19.5W		|
|-----2-----|
|11.5H		|
|19.5W		|
|-----1-----|

6" Deep for 1 shelf
12.5" Deep for both together

19.5W is within the current boundaries.  With heavy modifications could support up to 21".  Could possibly flip shelves to make more height

Ideally 40" Tall x 20" Wide x 10" deep with 12" between shelves 

- This one is 22 Wide x 42 High x 6 deep which isnt deep enough unless I strapped them on.  The top shelf is really more like 37" tall and it seems like it would tip over pretty easily, but I really like it though because it would be so easy to put away [This one](https://www.amazon.com/4-Tier-Kitchen-Storage-Cupboard-Casters/dp/B01KUZLAY4/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=rolling+kitchen+shelves&qid=1565147962&s=gateway&sr=8-8)
    - I could get two of them and tie them together to make them deeper and more stable!?!
- This one is 17 Wide x 41 High x 10 deep which seems perfect, but the top shelf is really more like 37" tall and plus has more shelves than I need and not enough space in between so I would have to remove some [This one](https://www.amazon.com/Cozzine-Lockable-Organizer-Shelving-Bathroom/dp/B07CQFR9BN/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=rolling+kitchen+shelves&qid=1565147962&s=gateway&sr=8-7)

# Power Cables Adapters #
Center is the same as Tip
Center Negative = Tip Negative

## What do I want in a power cable? ##
5. 9V
6. 5.5x2.1mm tip
3. Center Negative
4. 1A-2A
1. 6ft+ cable
2. Lots of amazon reviews
7. <$15

One Amp is important for some select pedals (Behringer) but most only require 300mA so that 0.5A will do.

THe Zoom needs Center Negative 9V

Most if not all 9V power supplies have the same tip.

These pedals seem to have the same adapters as Casio AD-5 
Casio SA-46 has center positive but otherwise the same

### Options ###
1. [$10.89, 9V, High Ratings, .8-1A, Tip Negative, 10ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DXF97BR/) The plug on this one looks wrong, but all of my research says it isn't [Same Device but more expensive and specific to the FX](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DND9Y1D)
2. [12.99, 9V, Few Ratings, 1.0A, Tip Negative, 6ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QC6L35G) This one seems really high quality
3. [$19.95, 9V, High Ratings, 2A, Tip Negative, 10Ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003OCLKP0) This one is not a wall wart so seems of the highest quality.  dont know what Amps though but since its got a big block its probably high amps?  [More Info about this at Amazon UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0077CZSZ6)
4. [12.99, 9V, Highest, 1A, Tip Negative, 6.5ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7FCC3P/) This looks like the finest cable with the best ratings.  
4. [$14.99, 9V, High Ratings, 1.0A, Tip Negative, 4-10ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KVT1DMQ/) This one has extensions for 8 devices

#### Runners up for various reasons ####
1. [$7.39,  9V, High Ratings, 0.5A, Tip Negative, 6.0ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00191WVF6)
2. [$7.99,  9V, High Ratings, .85A, Tip Negative, 6.6ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07234PV7Q)
3. [$6.99,  9V, Few  Ratings, 2.0A, Tip Negative, 3.3ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Z4Z32H1)

5. [$12.96, 9V, Few  Ratings, 1.0A, Unknown,         8ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JX4WPLG)
4. [12.49, 9V, No Ratings, 1.0A, Tip Negative, 6ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PLS3RHP) Probably the same device as the $10.89 one above.  Not Prime.
3. [$8.98, 9V, Few Ratings, 1.0A, Tip Negative, 6ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WJPXKNI) No amazon prime and it seems cheap


# Working with a Modeler #
[How to make your Helix or Kemper FEEL like the real thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J02heFTwEXY&t=483s)
1. Stick a subtle compressor at the end of the chain to simulate natural tube poweramp compression. "This is more of a feel thing than a tone thing"
2. We always perceive more volume as sounding better
3. Use [subtractive EQ](https://youtu.be/J02heFTwEXY?t=609) to affect the sound after the amp and cab but before the delay and reverb
4. Use a bit of soft clipping (subtle distortion) after amp and cab to simulate speaker and poweramp breakup

# What I Want #
Goals: Need to be able to easily get a killer brown sound and a killer warm creamy shimmering clean.

- Small
- Easy to plug in
- Easy to move
- Rechargeable
- Sexy

Possibly Also:
- Tinkerable: Independent of the warm soupy guitar tone of tube amps I really like the idea of tinkering with effects on a two monitor computer workstation and having the sound reflect what I do on my computer.  Probably want to pick the one that has the most presets from other people so I can work with other peoples stuff.
- Multiple amps: I like the idea of running my signal into multiple amps or amp sims.  Possibly for stereo effects, possibly just to create a more complete tone.  See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEgNn469gdg) at about 11 min for a demo of two amps at once and how good it sounds and how much they love it

New Desires
- Lightweight
- Controllable at eye level (not on the floor)
- Few cables (easy to set up)
- Great sounds
- Wah
- Looper Pedal (not too many cables)
- Solid power cable
- Dirty/Clean/Boost from footswitch
- Aux In
- Dual stereo amps with different sounds for amazing tones
- Crystalline Spongy Cleans
- Killer Pinnacle level Brown Sound

Low Baggage Tube Amp
1. Lightweight
2. Low maintenance
3. Super Quiet Bedroom / Phone Speaker / Line out levels
4. Great Warm Tone
5. Not too big
6. Not too many wires
7. Not too many controls
8. Not phone required (optional ok)

Ideal Tube Amp
1. Lightweight
2. Low Maintenance
3. Great Warm Fendery Clean Tone
4. Fits on my shelf (19.5Wx10Hx12D)
5. Headphone out on front
6. <250
7. Tnstantaneous response (probably means all tube required)
8. Front panel access
9. FX Loop for pedal experiments


## Some things I can try ##
1. Two Peavey Vypyrs in stereo
2. Play with the Vypyr Edit software with my VIP 1
3. Pinnacle with Vypyr Cleans

2. VHT 6
3. H&K
4. Supro Blue
5. Vox Blue

2. Peavey Vypyr Pro 100 (40lbs)
3. Axe FX II
4. Helix
5. HX Stomp

### Not Sure ###
9. Blackstar ID:Core or ID:Series (Updated reasonably often, problem with latest version of MacOS)
6. Zoom G5n, G3Xn, G1X (Professional Software patch list last updated in 2016)

### Second Place ###
7. Peavey Vypr (Wah, Looper control, Patch Selection, etc., Vypyr Edit software for VIP Series)

- "My Randall MTS R212NXT weighs 38 pounds. It has Neo Celestions in it."
- Look for "Compact 2x12"
- My old Carvin sx200 weighed only 40lbs with the amp in it!

Plan:
1. DONE! Get a Jazz Bass for Cristi
2. Quilter Microblock to complete my core tones


Future plans:
1. Stereo cleans
2. Pro Junior (I won’t be able to replicate this any other way)
3. Stereo with that thickener pedal into several tube amps
4. A/B some bass/guitar EQ configurations (Live knob twiddling with a looper on each signal to let me 
5. Measuring signal power and recording and patching in raw guitar signals off the web



## Other Options ##
- Apparently the Line6 Helix is just great
- Instead of headphones mount small stereo speakers on tall speaker stands to my left and right, or just one stereo bar speaker.
- Portable PA like Behringer Black MPA40BTPRO


## Investigate ##
- Weber Headphone
- Weber Mass
- Rivera RickCrusher
- Torpedo Live

- NuX Solid Studio $200
- Classy Supro amp that phil x played
- Matchless cleans?
- Mooer PreAMP Live (Tone Capture)

## Cabinets ##
- All of the Bluguitar cabs are special small and lightweight

## Channel Switch Lag ##
"The Diezel D-Moll doesn't have this drop issue, but it does have a little bit of a time lag when kicking in the channel change, and a bigger time lag when kicking in the fx loop. Can't speak for their other models."

"The Sig X is pretty much instantaneous across all modes."

"The Laney VH100r is instantaneous across all modes."

"The Satriani JVM is pretty much instantaneous across all modes.
Vanilla JVM definitely does it, I measure it once, about 50ms silence between changes."

Blackstar HT dont have this.  Chappers shows it off in his demo of the one and 5

[multiwatt dual rec has the problem](https://www.thefretboard.co.uk/discussion/27836/channel-switch-lag-problem).  pre multi watt doesnt but the switches eventually fail

"-You can't change between the distortion, heavy distortion, and clean settings within an amp bank. This means that in order to change between distortion and clean, you have to change between banks, and unfortunately, there is a brief pause while the VYPYR changes over. This isn't so bad for sitting at home, writing songs, but it is terrible for anything quick and on-the-go."
