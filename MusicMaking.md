# Magix Music Maker #
This is great.
1. Really easy to record little clips and move them around
2. Shift 1 to set a jump marker, jump doesnt work for me, but click on the jump marker and move mouse back and forth to affect the record  entry point (the yellow bar at the top)
3. middle click to start and stop playback or spacebar
4. r to start recording
5. I had to select some Settings->AudioMidi->Direct Sound and then restart and then set the mic right and some tinkering took about 15 minutes to get it to record from my mic port on the front of my computer after install.
6. A little pop often happens when recording starts, I can just drag the edge of the sound from the left a hair to remove it.
7. I can save all of the tracks as their own wav files
8. Cant import mp3 directly but convert in Audacity and then browse to the folder from the pane on hte right then drag in from there.  Might be able to drag from anywhere, havent tested that
9. zooming is weird
10. Shift scroll wheel scrolls left right
11. Control scroll wheel scrolls vertically (not that useful, should zoom imho)
12. To next prev object edge: Ctrl shift left right  update: Tried to fix this but keyboard short cut assignments arent working for that.  Ctrl shift left doesnt let me assign shortcut.
14. Beginning of project: home
15. End of Project: end
16. page down and up to scroll right left (ctrl page up down to snap scroll)
17. Ctrl shift pgup/down to scroll to the next jump marker
18. Left right move over by .006 or 7 sec.  Ctrl left right move by .03 or so sec
19. If you hit enter when clicked on the main window but outside a track, then accidentally hit enter the window closes.  F4 or View->Standard View resets it.
20. I dont know how to select a track for pasting.  Paste into existing track at the end and then drag down.
21. If you resize the window the tabs on the right can get messed up, F4 or View-Standard View fixes that too
22. Volume int he bottom right affects the mixed tracks overall volume as well as monitor volume
23. Well now a few days later after I successfully recorded all of my vocals I am having a problem with MIDI.  I fixed it by in the settings changing it to ASIO Driver Magix Low Latency 2016 and now I can type on the keyboard to play the pianos!
24. Holy shit.  If you select Scale Keyboard then it all of a sudden only plays notes in the damn scale you pick.  Holy shit thats awesome!  With just a few little quirks and caveats this software is proving to be a miracle worker honestly!
25. It looks a lot like its got a simple arpeggiator built into the keyboard program at the bottom.  If so I'm going to flip out but I dont even want to check for fear of disappointment haha.  well yup it sure is!!!
26. I'm trying to figure out how to lower the octave on the keyboardkeyboard.  Blowing my mind the internets are saying there is no way to do it.  "Just go buy a midi keyboard" they say "merely spend money you dont have on something you dont want and put it in a space you dont have" they might as well be saying.  "simply purchase an L shaped desk and a spinning office chair to your workstation and whenever you want to play a note on the piano instead of using the mechanical keyboard which is a joy and which you spent a lot of money on, rotate to the left and scoot your chair toward the musickeyboard and arrange your shoulders and then play your part and then when you want to see the monitor just turn your head 90 degrees to the right.  And when you want to hit record or move the start point a hair to the right or record a different section just do all of that in reverse and then find the mouse and click on the right stuff and then do all of that rotation and resituation over again.  no big deal" they are implying.  While I am overdramatizing it, this is simply not an insignificant impact to my workflow and trivializing it like this makes me feel like I'm supposed to have this whole rig arranged when instead if this software had two keyboard shortcuts more none of this would be an issue.  "Since you dont have room whatsoever to add another table to your workstation whenever you want to play a few notes on your keyboard just stand up and lean the player keyboard on top of the typing keyboard being careful not to hit the f keys and then bend your wrists down to play"  Its absurd to imagine buying hardware and rearranging my workstation and workflow to compensate for commercial software not having two keyboard shortcuts.  Maybe I can use autohotkey to do this somehow?  
	- Possibly you can use the midi editor instead of the keyboard which then pg up and down do affect the octave.  How to open midi editor?  Well I could only figure out recording some empty space on a midid track and then double clicking the empty space
	- The up down arrows at the top left of it are the octave buttons I'm looking for honestly.
27.  Also Alt Tab has a funky funny effect it plays one of the keys and then keeps it held down haha
28.  Also For some reason my track has decided to play a demo song even though its no where on the screen without stopping haha. I think that was just the instrument preview on the right getting activated somehow
29. Ok I just bought the plus version and when I launched the installer it just said "Remove from your computer" I presume it was talking about the free one but it didnt say anything about that nor give me any other option haha.  I hope it didnt delete the songs I already made though ...  hmm ... oh well.  Oh, possibly I could have just activated the free version.  I didnt even think of that.  oh well to that too. :)
30.  Found out a few minutes ago that there are some free soundpools and stuff if you sort by price in the pane on the rihgt.
31.  Also rumor has it that the free version can load external VSTs ... I guess I'll never know now though haha
32. I followed the instructions after purchase and my start menu account tab doesnt look anything like what they suggested it should.  I dont know how to get.  Ok I restarted the program (not because there was any prompt or reason to do so) and now I can get my free stuff.
33. Omg the licenses are noncommercial!?!  I'll have to buy the commercial license for $70 or just the parts I want to make commercial.  I think thats pretty bunk honestly they shouldnt even offer them if theyre noncommercial.  Thats tacky imho.
34  Trying to activate soundpools and their software is so weird and buggy that every time I try to search for 'cinematic worlds' in the search bar my cd drive spins up to full speed and a cd listing shows up that I've never seen before lol.
35 	When youve dropped a loop in the scene you can change the key at the top for that measure!
36  View->Arranger->Horizontal Scrolling (You'll thank me later)  Shift still works.
37  Three times now I have had to press ctrl-s twice before it saved
38 The Song Maker is one of the coolest and greatest things Ive ever seen for music creation ever
39 You do have to select some tightly themed samples or you end up with some real clusterfuck shit!
40 there are a crazy ton of folders that this program uses all over the hard drive: %UserProfile%\AppData\Roaming\MAGIX\mm29 and in the ini files in there are most of the other folders
41 Tom has "Vita 2" and I had "Vita LE" and I thought something had installed wrong so I found this C:\ProgramData\MAGIX\Music Maker\29\MxSynth and saw that Vita2 wasnt there but VitaLE was so I deleted it and thought that maybe it would let me redownload vita 2 but it didnt.  I figured Vita 2 was the later version of vita le, but perhaps its the opposite because ... I uninstalled the plus version and reinstalled the free version and vita le was installed again (the free version lists vita 2 as an instrument).  So then I reinstalled the plus version.  Note: the files are exactly the same size.  And MD5 is exactly the same too.  They are the same installers: the free one from the website and the plus one from my email.  Maybe tom can send me vita 2 or vice versa.  Maybe he can install the newer version in a new folder and maybe then it will install vita le and then we will both have it?  Interesting: it claims that in the update "problems loading vita 2 have been fixed" does that mean that even with vita le I can load a vita 2 file?
42 I tried mixing to mp3 and it told me it couldnt until I assigned a midi instrument to one of the tracks.  I had copypasted some ideas to that track and even thouh it was muted it wanted it to be assigned to an instrument so it could be heard.  YOu know what it might have proceeded anyway tbh

# Jamming Online #
- [Hookpad](https://www.hooktheory.com/hookpad/app) is so cool you get to lay out chord progression and it plays them for you.  Its great for songwriting because it keeps you in the key.  If you want to export directly you have to purchase for $5. (thats just for one month) but then it can go to MIDI or guitartab or sheet music.  One really cool feature is you just type 1-7 with your keys but if you get up to 7 and go right back to 1 it assumes you're trying to go up an octave!  Thats so intuitive!  Its got a magic chord feature (only available a few times in the free version) that you can use twice that fills in a chord and tells you what pop songs used that chord in that situation.  Tip: "you can only use it like twice a day unless you pay, but you can work around it by clearing your cookies."
- ChordChord lets you make chord progressions.  You define the key, instrument, arpeggiation, tempo, scale, etc and it will generate chord progressions.  This could be used to generate chords for entire songs very quickly.  Pro version ($5/mo) exports to midi which could then be loaded into garage band.
- Sampulator is a really cool rhythm machine.  It uses the keyboard with easy recording and playback (shift and space).  No export though.
- [Autochords](https://autochords.com/) generates chord progressions in any key with different feels

This is a great program with a funky interface.  Its really cool how you can use layers and how you can introduce chords.  I wish it had some kind of automatic arpeggiation feature but maybe it does or maybe theres an easy way to use what it has to do that.  I don't know how to explicitly save or load and scrolling around is unusual.  I dont know what most of the buttons do.  

## Learning ##
- Right click switches layers.  You can also click the box button in the top left and select a layer from there. 
- Middle click and drag on a note to lower the attack


# DAWs and VSTs #
I was looking for free or cheap DAWs to use VSTs with because there are so many cool VSTs that I want to fiddle with.  Well first I figured out that you don't need a DAW that you can use VSTs with a little host program like savihost.

"A large freeware/donationware/magazineware collection seems more fun to me than just a few faceless giant synths, not denying the excellence of payware sounds, but I really enjoy the interaction of many developers, and the perpetual motion of new instruments and sounds arriving every week, and with remarkable quality in many cases." [From KVR Audio Thread](https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=264273&start=15)

## Using VSTs ##
To use VSTs you need a host (some or many come as standalone packages as well but you can't assume that they will for sure) and a good way to do that is using a DAW.  Here is a list of [free VST hosts (including DAWs)](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/2011/05/16/bpb-freeware-studio-best-free-vst-host-applications/)

- Perhaps the easiest way to use a VST plugin is to use [Savihost](https://www.hermannseib.com/english/savihost.htm).  Just rename this savihost.exe to the name of the plugin and go.  It also lets you record to wav files very easily so its super easy to make a quick synth sound for a game. Oh and it looks like it comes built in with a keyboard on the bottom so you can test it out with key typing.  For the first vst I used I took for granted that it had that built in.  One side effect is that I can't use the keyboard while I adjust the values on the vst also the keyboard isnt instantly responsive..  A tiny midi keyboard and one of the free daws might be best for that. Its cool that it lets you save the entire configuration of teh VST and load it up again anytime. 


# Free or Inexpensive DAWs #
### Winners ###
- [Cakewalk by Bandlab](https://www.bandlab.com/products/cakewalk) *Winner* which is apparently basically the latest version of Sonar but with none of the bundled extras.  Windows only.  To use it you just have to sign up for their online account which has [no annoying or nagging ads](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/2015/11/11/free-daw-software/) This seems to be the most fully featured of all.
- [Traktion T7 Free](https://www.tracktion.com/products/t7-daw) is completely free last version of the software.  Mac and Windows.  No limitations.  VST support.  This is a great choice. fast efficient workflow but has a steeper learning curve.
- [Reaper $60](https://www.reaper.fm) is free to try (and apparently never expires) and only $60 for full version and is very professional.  I'm feeling like this is a great choice at this point and is probably worth the small investment.

## Runners Up ##
- [Protools First](https://www.avid.com/pro-tools-first) this is free cloud based music creation with protools level stuff, and with a few limitations: Requires broadband (you apparently can't save to your hard drive), 16 max tracks, 96khz max sample rate, and 3 total projects.  It comes with 23 plugins and 3.1GB of included sounds.  If you want to upgrade to the full version of Pro Tools which changes all of these limitations (cloud is limited to 1GB) its $30/month.  Mac or PC
- [Podium Free](https://zynewave.com/podium-free/) this is considered the [undisputed champion of freeware DAWs](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/2015/01/23/pro-tools-free/).    Limitations are no ReWire plugins, No surround sound, 64bit mixer engine disabled, midi input and output limited to 1, and only one CPU core will be used for all plugins.  I wonder if other DAWs actually use all of the CPU cores or if this is an advanced feature of Podium commercial anyway.  Unbelievable that this is by one guy.  The full version has a very small file size, and includes a demo so you can try it out (which affects your outputted tracks until you register).  Full version is $50.  Windows Only
- [Studio One Prime](https://shop.presonus.com/Studio-One-4-Prime) is [highly regarded](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/2015/01/23/pro-tools-free/) along with Podium Free as one of the best. Only runs on 64 bit OSs.   Full version is $100.  Windows or Mac
- [$69 Tracktion Waveform](https://www.tracktion.com/products/waveform)
- Apparently Garageband can use VSTs now?
- Music Maker is like GarageBand on Windows (VST support isn't clear)
- Logic Pro is $199
- [Ardour](https://community.ardour.org/download) is open source and looks pretty full featured.  I dont trust it to be intuitive or consistent enough or to not accidentally leave out features though.  
- [Soundbridge](http://soundbridge.io) is free for PC or Mac and looks great but doesnt have midi typing
- MuLab $69
- LMMS is free and great for doing synth work even if its a bit clunky open source.  

- [$99 Melodyne](https://www.celemony.com/en/melodyne/what-is-melodyne) lets you correct your recordings and do other cool things with all audio like change pitch of each note and "Optimize the tiniest details of your recordings" This way you can fix all kinds of mistakes in timing and pitch

# Songwriting #
## Some song structures ##
1. intro2, chorus4, verse16, chorus8, verse8, chorus8, bridge8, chorus16, outro 4
2. intro4, verse16, prechorus8, chorus8, verse8, chorus8, bridge8, chorus16, outro 4

	
- "The hook should be half as long as the first verse and the intro should be half as long as the hook"

Chorus
Not based on lyric but what sounds great and hooks them in 
Instrumentation dominates the hook

Verse
Lyrics dominate the verse

Bridge
Then the bridge takes them somewhere else musically
	Maybe a different key
	Take them away from the song

Prechorus
Builds up anticipation for the chorus with instumentation or a filter or build up

intro
