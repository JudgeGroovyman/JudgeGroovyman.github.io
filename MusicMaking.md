# Magix Music Maker #
This is great.
1. Really easy to record little clips and move them around
2. Shift 1 to set a jump marker, jump doesnt work for me, but click on the jump marker and move mouse back and forth to affect the record  entry point (the yellow bar at the top)
3. middle click to start and stop playback or spacebar
4. r to start recording
5. I had to select some Settings->AudioMidi->Direct Sound and then restart and then set the mic right and some tinkering took about 15 minutes to get it to record from my mic port on the front of my computer after install.
6. A little pop often happens when recording starts, I can just drag the edge of the sound from the left a hair to remove it.
7. I can save all of the tracks as their own wav files
8. Cant import mp3 directly but convert in Audacity and then browse to the folder from the pane on hte right then drag in from there.  Might be able to drag from anywhere, havent tested that
9. zooming is weird
10. Shift scroll wheel scrolls left right
11. Control scroll wheel scrolls vertically (not that useful, should zoom imho)
12. To next prev object edge: Ctrl shift left right  update: Tried to fix this but keyboard short cut assignments arent working for that.  Ctrl shift left doesnt let me assign shortcut.
14. Beginning of project: home
15. End of Project: end
16. page down and up to scroll right left (ctrl page up down to snap scroll)
17. Ctrl shift pgup/down to scroll to the next jump marker
18. Left right move over by .006 or 7 sec.  Ctrl left right move by .03 or so sec
19. If you hit enter when clicked on the main window but outside a track, then accidentally hit enter the window closes.  F4 or View->Standard View resets it.
20. I dont know how to select a track for pasting.  Paste into existing track at the end and then drag down.
21. If you resize the window the tabs on the right can get messed up, F4 or View-Standard View fixes that too
22. Volume int he bottom right affects the mixed tracks overall volume as well as monitor volume
23. Well now a few days later after I successfully recorded all of my vocals I am having a problem with MIDI.  I fixed it by in the settings changing it to ASIO Driver Magix Low Latency 2016 and now I can type on the keyboard to play the pianos!
24. Holy shit.  If you select Scale Keyboard then it all of a sudden only plays notes in the damn scale you pick.  Holy shit thats awesome!  With just a few little quirks and caveats this software is proving to be a miracle worker honestly!
25. It looks a lot like its got a simple arpeggiator built into the keyboard program at the bottom.  If so I'm going to flip out but I dont even want to check for fear of disappointment haha.  well yup it sure is!!!
26. I'm trying to figure out how to lower the octave on the keyboardkeyboard.  Blowing my mind the internets are saying there is no way to do it.  "Just go buy a midi keyboard" they say "merely spend money you dont have on something you dont want and put it in a space you dont have" they might as well be saying.  "simply purchase an L shaped desk and a spinning office chair to your workstation and whenever you want to play a note on the piano instead of using the mechanical keyboard which is a joy and which you spent a lot of money on, rotate to the left and scoot your chair toward the musickeyboard and arrange your shoulders and then play your part and then when you want to see the monitor just turn your head 90 degrees to the right.  And when you want to hit record or move the start point a hair to the right or record a different section just do all of that in reverse and then find the mouse and click on the right stuff and then do all of that rotation and resituation over again.  no big deal" they are implying.  While I am overdramatizing it, this is simply not an insignificant impact to my workflow and trivializing it like this makes me feel like I'm supposed to have this whole rig arranged when instead if this software had two keyboard shortcuts more none of this would be an issue.  "Since you dont have room whatsoever to add another table to your workstation whenever you want to play a few notes on your keyboard just stand up and lean the player keyboard on top of the typing keyboard being careful not to hit the f keys and then bend your wrists down to play"  Its absurd to imagine buying hardware and rearranging my workstation and workflow to compensate for commercial software not having two keyboard shortcuts.  Maybe I can use autohotkey to do this somehow?  
	- Possibly you can use the midi editor instead of the keyboard which then pg up and down do affect the octave.  How to open midi editor?  Well I could only figure out recording some empty space on a midid track and then double clicking the empty space
	- The up down arrows at the top left of it are the octave buttons I'm looking for honestly.
27.  Also Alt Tab has a funky funny effect it plays one of the keys and then keeps it held down haha
28.  Also For some reason my track has decided to play a demo song even though its no where on the screen without stopping haha. I think that was just the instrument preview on the right getting activated somehow
29. Ok I just bought the plus version and when I launched the installer it just said "Remove from your computer" I presume it was talking about the free one but it didnt say anything about that nor give me any other option haha.  I hope it didnt delete the songs I already made though ...  hmm ... oh well.  Oh, possibly I could have just activated the free version.  I didnt even think of that.  oh well to that too. :)
30.  Found out a few minutes ago that there are some free soundpools and stuff if you sort by price in the pane on the rihgt.
31.  Also rumor has it that the free version can load external VSTs ... I guess I'll never know now though haha
32. I followed the instructions after purchase and my start menu account tab doesnt look anything like what they suggested it should.  I dont know how to get.  Ok I restarted the program (not because there was any prompt or reason to do so) and now I can get my free stuff.
33. Omg the licenses are noncommercial!?!  I'll have to buy the commercial license for $70 or just the parts I want to make commercial.  I think thats pretty bunk honestly they shouldnt even offer them if theyre noncommercial.  Thats tacky imho.
34.  Trying to activate soundpools and their software is so weird and buggy that every time I try to search for 'cinematic worlds' in the search bar my cd drive spins up to full speed and a cd listing shows up that I've never seen before lol.
35. 	When youve dropped a loop in the scene you can change the key at the top for that measure!
36.  View->Arranger->Horizontal Scrolling (You'll thank me later)  Shift still works.
37.  Three times now I have had to press ctrl-s twice before it saved
38. The Song Maker is one of the coolest and greatest things Ive ever seen for music creation ever
39. You do have to select some tightly themed samples or you end up with some real clusterfuck shit!
40. there are a crazy ton of folders that this program uses all over the hard drive: %UserProfile%\AppData\Roaming\MAGIX\mm29 and in the ini files in there are most of the other folders
41. Tom has "Vita 2" and I had "Vita LE" and I thought something had installed wrong so I found this C:\ProgramData\MAGIX\Music Maker\29\MxSynth and saw that Vita2 wasnt there but VitaLE was so I deleted it and thought that maybe it would let me redownload vita 2 but it didnt.  I figured Vita 2 was the later version of vita le, but perhaps its the opposite because ... I uninstalled the plus version and reinstalled the free version and vita le was installed again (the free version lists vita 2 as an instrument).  So then I reinstalled the plus version.  Note: the files are exactly the same size.  And MD5 is exactly the same too.  They are the same installers: the free one from the website and the plus one from my email.  Maybe tom can send me vita 2 or vice versa.  Maybe he can install the newer version in a new folder and maybe then it will install vita le and then we will both have it?  Interesting: it claims that in the update "problems loading vita 2 have been fixed" does that mean that even with vita le I can load a vita 2 file?
42. I tried mixing to mp3 and it told me it couldnt until I assigned a midi instrument to one of the tracks.  I had copypasted some ideas to that track and even thouh it was muted it wanted it to be assigned to an instrument so it could be heard.  YOu know what it might have proceeded anyway tbh

# Jamming Online #
- [Hookpad](https://www.hooktheory.com/hookpad/app) is so cool you get to lay out chord progression and it plays them for you.  Its great for songwriting because it keeps you in the key.  If you want to export directly you have to purchase for $5. (thats just for one month) but then it can go to MIDI or guitartab or sheet music.  One really cool feature is you just type 1-7 with your keys but if you get up to 7 and go right back to 1 it assumes you're trying to go up an octave!  Thats so intuitive!  Its got a magic chord feature (only available a few times in the free version) that you can use twice that fills in a chord and tells you what pop songs used that chord in that situation.  Tip: "you can only use it like twice a day unless you pay, but you can work around it by clearing your cookies."
- ChordChord lets you make chord progressions.  You define the key, instrument, arpeggiation, tempo, scale, etc and it will generate chord progressions.  This could be used to generate chords for entire songs very quickly.  Pro version ($5/mo) exports to midi which could then be loaded into garage band.
- Sampulator is a really cool rhythm machine.  It uses the keyboard with easy recording and playback (shift and space).  No export though.
- [Autochords](https://autochords.com/) generates chord progressions in any key with different feels

# Helio #
This is a great program with a funky interface.  Its really cool how you can use layers and how you can introduce chords.  I wish it had some kind of automatic arpeggiation feature but maybe it does or maybe theres an easy way to use what it has to do that.  I don't know how to explicitly save or load and scrolling around is unusual.  I dont know what most of the buttons do.  

## Learning ##
- Right click switches layers.  You can also click the box button in the top left and select a layer from there. 
- Middle click and drag on a note to lower the attack


# DAWs and VSTs #
I was looking for free or cheap DAWs to use VSTs with because there are so many cool VSTs that I want to fiddle with.  Well first I figured out that you don't need a DAW that you can use VSTs with a little host program like savihost.

"A large freeware/donationware/magazineware collection seems more fun to me than just a few faceless giant synths, not denying the excellence of payware sounds, but I really enjoy the interaction of many developers, and the perpetual motion of new instruments and sounds arriving every week, and with remarkable quality in many cases." [From KVR Audio Thread](https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=264273&start=15)

## Using VSTs ##
To use VSTs you need a host (some or many come as standalone packages as well but you can't assume that they will for sure) and a good way to do that is using a DAW.  Here is a list of [free VST hosts (including DAWs)](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/2011/05/16/bpb-freeware-studio-best-free-vst-host-applications/)

- Perhaps the easiest way to use a VST plugin is to use [Savihost](https://www.hermannseib.com/english/savihost.htm).  Just rename this savihost.exe to the name of the plugin and go.  It also lets you record to wav files very easily so its super easy to make a quick synth sound for a game. Oh and it looks like it comes built in with a keyboard on the bottom so you can test it out with key typing.  For the first vst I used I took for granted that it had that built in.  One side effect is that I can't use the keyboard while I adjust the values on the vst also the keyboard isnt instantly responsive..  A tiny midi keyboard and one of the free daws might be best for that. Its cool that it lets you save the entire configuration of teh VST and load it up again anytime. 


# Free or Inexpensive DAWs #
### Winners ###
- [Cakewalk by Bandlab](https://www.bandlab.com/products/cakewalk) *Winner* which is apparently basically the latest version of Sonar but with none of the bundled extras.  Windows only.  To use it you just have to sign up for their online account which has [no annoying or nagging ads](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/2015/11/11/free-daw-software/) This seems to be the most fully featured of all.
- [Traktion T7 Free](https://www.tracktion.com/products/t7-daw) is completely free last version of the software.  Mac and Windows.  No limitations.  VST support.  This is a great choice. fast efficient workflow but has a steeper learning curve.
- [Reaper $60](https://www.reaper.fm) *Winner* is free to try (and apparently never expires) and only $60 for full version and is very professional.  I'm feeling like this is a great choice at this point and is probably worth the small investment.

## Runners Up ##
- [Protools First](https://www.avid.com/pro-tools-first) this is free cloud based music creation with protools level stuff, and with a few limitations: Requires broadband (you apparently can't save to your hard drive), 16 max tracks, 96khz max sample rate, and 3 total projects.  It comes with 23 plugins and 3.1GB of included sounds.  If you want to upgrade to the full version of Pro Tools which changes all of these limitations (cloud is limited to 1GB) its $30/month.  Mac or PC
- [Podium Free](https://zynewave.com/podium-free/) this is considered the [undisputed champion of freeware DAWs](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/2015/01/23/pro-tools-free/).    Limitations are no ReWire plugins, No surround sound, 64bit mixer engine disabled, midi input and output limited to 1, and only one CPU core will be used for all plugins.  I wonder if other DAWs actually use all of the CPU cores or if this is an advanced feature of Podium commercial anyway.  Unbelievable that this is by one guy.  The full version has a very small file size, and includes a demo so you can try it out (which affects your outputted tracks until you register).  Full version is $50.  Windows Only
- [Studio One Prime](https://shop.presonus.com/Studio-One-4-Prime) is [highly regarded](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/2015/01/23/pro-tools-free/) along with Podium Free as one of the best. Only runs on 64 bit OSs.   Full version is $100.  Windows or Mac
- [$69 Tracktion Waveform](https://www.tracktion.com/products/waveform)
- Apparently Garageband can use VSTs now?  Yup!  Done it!
- Music Maker is like GarageBand on Windows (VST support isn't clear)
- Logic Pro is $199
- [Ardour](https://community.ardour.org/download) is open source and looks pretty full featured.  I dont trust it to be intuitive or consistent enough or to not accidentally leave out features though.  
- [Soundbridge](http://soundbridge.io) is free for PC or Mac and looks great but doesnt have midi typing
- MuLab $69
- LMMS is free and great for doing synth work even if its a bit clunky open source.  

- [$99 Melodyne](https://www.celemony.com/en/melodyne/what-is-melodyne) lets you correct your recordings and do other cool things with all audio like change pitch of each note and "Optimize the tiniest details of your recordings" This way you can fix all kinds of mistakes in timing and pitch

# VSTs #

## Chiptunes ##
- Renoise obviously
- [Sunvox](https://www.warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/) - Tracker + a thousand other things for pc and ios.
- [OpenMPT](https://openmpt.org) I have not had good luck with this tracker, but it seems to be the most popular one for some time.  VST Plugin compatible too.  Recent updates too.  On second look it doesnt look bad, but I dont know what instruments i could use except I do because I could use instruments from my favorite amiga mods.  
- [RandARP Randomized Arpeggiator](https://codefn42.com/randarp/index.html) Free Arpeggiator
- [Transition a music bot simulator for randomized sounds](https://codefn42.com/transition/index.html) its like playing a little programmed game that makes music

 Some of the MODS I remember best:
- Face the music (Fred Fish Disk)
- Backpopped
- AxelF
- Amiganuts
- Crystal Hammer
- Amegas
- Megaball of course
- Cybernetix high score
- Cybernetix menu song

Finding things on Modarchive
1. I've had good luck looking at crystal hammer and picking a weird instrument name and then seaarching for that in the instrument names of other songs.  Also you can filter on filesize and most songs from back in the day were small <100k to fit on a disk and also 

Trackers
1. OctaMED is amazing
	- OctaMED Sound Studio latest version is freeware and has a windowed gui which is sort of nice but I like the old graphical guis, but it also has a super annoying warning when firing it up
2. Protracker.  Everyone says its great but I've never used it
3. [AHX](https://battleofthebits.org/lyceum/View/AHX+Tracker/) this is a tracker for Amiga created just to sound like a c64
4. Windows OpenMPT
5. Mac Renoise (also for Windows and uses VSTs and is probably the best ever)
6. Schism Tracker is like impulse tracker for dos but for all systems.  I tried using this a fewyyears back and it was super clunky and clumsy to use.  Hard to navigate.  I had a love hate with it.
7. [Musicline](https://www.musicline.org/main.html) is a full version 1.15 which lets you use realtime calculated waveforms and might be the best on Amiga but apparently its hard to use
8. HivelyTracker is like AHX and was updated in the last few months on Github probably windows only 
9. [klystrack](http://kometbomb.github.io/klystrack/) is for making C64/NES/Amiga chiptunes

Just [TONS more here at woolyss](https://woolyss.com/chipmusic-chiptrackers.php?s=Mac)  or [here at Trackerbase](https://trackerbase.blogspot.com/2014/01/ahx.html)

Lemmings Music
I'm 99% sure that all of the Lemmings songs were made using the instruments from the aminet pack called [MED Songs](https://aminet.net/package/mods/med/MED-Songs) the songs arent good but ... 

Aminet 
- the archive called Cool Tunes Exarch is real good the slow song is interesting
- The 11th hour sounds a bit like a more boring Streets of Rage 2
- Digital Cadaver is pretty epic megadeth style metal actually
- Groove has a great sounding bass and some other really AMIGA sounding instruments make me think of jims intro.  Great one to start with.
- in MED_Collection theres MEDley.MED which has simple instruments and would be a great platform for me to make new music.  All of the songs in this collection would be great platforms


Composers

 Trying Trackers
* [FastTracker2 Clone](https://16-bits.org/ft2.php) I'm trying this on mac and I'm having a great experience so far.  Oct 22 2020  Super intuitive and responsive and not clumsy at all.  Its really just what I expected.  I like that it has a keyboard at the bottom of the screen.  
	- Holy shit its got nibbles built right into the software my god!
	- I dont see undo which is potentially a big deal
	- I dont really get how to edit these files theres something kind of missing
	- I deleted a note and it moved all subsequent notes up.  How do I undo that?  How do I move all subsequent notes back down?
	- I think highly of this but its just a little too frustrating so I'm calling it quits for now
* [Protracker2 Clone](https://16-bits.org/pt2.php) I'm trying this and to get it running it made me move the program to another folder and back. Thts interesting.  It said something about a sandbox and fasttracker didnt do that for some reason. Something about the INI file.  Anyway once I did that it fired right up and its working and the scroll wheel is working so its a pretty comfortable UI and thats nice.  the resolution is smaller than fasttracker so it doesnt seem as user friendly imho. 
	- I like the pointer and how it feel sand clicks more than the ft2 clone actually. 
	When i switched away from the window I had to like right click on the window to reactivate it
	- Theres nothing wrong with this one but I just think fasttracker clone is better its bigger and more realestate means legitimately more functionality
* I fired up OctaMED4 and it was instantly like meeting an old friend again.  Theres no scrollwheel for the file selectors.  probably not for the main window either.  
	- The scrollbars are large so the wheel is not that big of a deal
	- Weird on my external Keychron K4 keyboard I cant use the F5 and F6 keys unless I've got the f-key row in special function mode.  the f7-f11 work just fine (f12 obviously reserved) but f5 (octave change) and F6 (go to the beggining of the block) dont work.  I found a tricky keychron feature that overrides this unless you hold fn k c for 3s.  Yup fixed!
* [BoscaCeoil]( https://boscaceoil.net)I think this is from some perspectives the best music maker because it fixes the problem of keys for you, however it doesnt run on mac anymore (probably 64bit problem) and the online version is down so its windows only atm.
* [Milkytracker](https://milkytracker.org) is foss and probably a good choice sort of but Rumor has it "There's nothing modern or convenient about Milkytracker, the majority of people who fanboy it do so because that's what they learned on."  Its popular so there are extensive [tutorials like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRDlix-KT1E)
* [LMMS](https://lmms.io/download#mac) free cross platform tracker with VSt SUpport
* [Famitracker](http://famitracker.com)
* OpenMPT
* [Renoise $0-$75](https://www.renoise.com) of course which is one of the best ever and has been around for a long time now and is really advanced and uses VSTs. Commercial.  Free version doesnt output to WAV
* Sunvox - rumor has it this is more for just messing around
* Deflemask is rumored to be more usable than Milkytracker at this point [700 person Deflemask Discord](https://discord.com/invite/dhrVeD2)
* [Revisit.info $0-$30](https://revisit.info/features.asp) this is cool because its a VST Plugin that is a tracker so you use it INSIDE your daw. One cool thing is it has musical layers!
* [BeRoTracker](https://www.kvraudio.com/product/berotracker-by-benjamin-rosseaux) is a VST Plugin that can also host VST Plugins!  It can load all ofyour tracker mods and play them back in your songs

"amazing tip for guitar recording, which not many people know of is: record 2 "identical takes, energy-align them with vocalign or revoice pro. then you have 2 different takes with the exact same energy levels at all times, so you can spread them LR, and they don't wobble in the stereo image. punchy like a mono-take but real stereo." tschimi tschortsch https://youtu.be/aNDmY-wU-MA&t=4304

# Recording Guitar with Garageband #

ON Mar 10 2021 
Option 1: Ive got my guitar plugged directlyy into the irig which I got like 10 yrs ago or so and headphones from teh irig to my years.  without the headphones plugged into the irig it seemed that it wasn't recognizing that anything was plugged into that plug ... or maybe it was a conflict with bluetooth earbuds?

Option 2: plugged into my peavey vypyr vip1 and out of the phones out of it I can't monitor the tone though  atm.   Plugging the headphones into the amp sounds good on bypass but Even with the master on 0 there is a small high pitched sound at all times.  Touching my laptop case with my fingers makes a buszzing sound through the headphones of the amp even though they arent connected.  Now how to get the sound from the headphones out of the amp to my computers mic/audioLR (tip/ring/sleeve is that what its called?) Ok well I have some splitters kind of like that but they are male/male->female and so that wont work, and I would need several tricky patch cables including a trs male to male an I dont have any of that.  

Option 3: guitar into vypyr, vypyr headphones into $10 usb audio interface with headphone and microphone inputs.  This works and sounds pretty good!  I've got a tube screamer in the amp, and a fender twin.  now there is a pretty pronounced red sounding whine coming through my phones that isnt afffected by amp volume or computer volume so I think its my interface.  lets see ... plugging the phones into the computer directly the whine is coming from the monitored guitar signal.  probably from the amp headphone out.  maybe if I used it in another rooom with fewer electronics it wouldnt do it idk. lets try using eq to get rid of it.  Looks like its at 4080 hz but thats a nice guitar range so its going to affect tone, and even pulling that out a lot you can still hear it.   Yeah that works but isnt usable either.

Option 4: peavey vypyr usb as an interface.  would that even work?  Holy shit yes. INnstanlyt recognied as an audio interface.  NO hiss.  No whine.  Superb clarity.  update: actually the peavey has a noise reduction in it so there is a noise when palying but its not bad like those others and should be usable.  lets find out. WHOA  I dont know what I did but as I was twiddling knobs on the amp ... the track in garageband panned hard left lol ... omg it does it every tiem I change stomp boxes in the amp lol!  oh!  anytime it goes into monophonic effect mode it changes to pan hard left.  but when you switch back to stereo it doesnt center it up again lol.  Even going to bypass stompboxes does this.  So if you are switching stomppboxes stay on the black label ones or you'll have to go into your track and switch it back.  Ok so thats a quirk and minor annoyance otherwise this works really really well.  It sounds fantastic and is easy to hookup.  USB out to my usb in, stomp box set to bypass. amplifier to twin.  pregainat4oclock, low at230, mid12, high130, post7.  I wish tap tempo would stop blinking sometime lol but lots of devices do that.   Another thing I like about htis is I can have it just sitting there and I dont need any desk space.  If I want to I could add a tubescreamer too or actually some wah too.  its great and works great!  One thing thats funny is even though the vu on each track is showing signal, there is no waveform to speak of, but tiny little pixel dots.  Anyway I'm real satisfied with this solution.

Option 5: guitar into roland cube 30, roland cube 30 recording out into little usb interface.  It works just fine. There is a constant white noise possibly from the interface.  lets see if its in headphones ... its faint in headphones only when its up loud.  using the interface the hiss is alwayys there.  It sounds good above that though but thats not really workable

Option 6: Peavey usb as an interface (again) this sounds great, especially on cleans here in garage band.   There is semi substantial clearlyaudible latency.  thats ok for now but I wonder where it is coming from.  It could be my memory but I dont think we had latency problem through the little usb interface.  

Option 7: YES Peavey usb as an interface but using the peavey sounds into a clean garageeband amp.  This sounds great an dthe noise isnt too bad.  There is no latency atm.  

Mar 12 2021:
Option 8: YES Zoom into mac ... well see theres a problem:  I'm using it with USB power from the same plug that my laptop is plugged into and using headphones out of the zoom its noisy ... but thats not the problem.  Maybe this little usb adapter is bullshit or broke or something because I thought it used to work but I can't run any cables from this into that and get any good sound.  Maybe with the headphone amp???  the soudn is a little buzzy in headphones but still sounds really good  (though I would like to get a higher gain brown sound like in my vypyr) but its terrible plugged into this usb thing.  Ive used several cables too same result.  This isnt just terrible in the sense that its unusable: its terrible like cant hear the sound of the guitar.  I suspect the headphone buzzing has to do with the usb power being so dirty.  Update: its not the cable or the interface.  The interface is NOT great, and is HIssy but it works fine just hissy from the roland cube, but usable for noisy clean sounds (not for high gain too noisy).  I tried the usb interface from several usb ports too and it didnt matter.  OH!  Interesting!  I pulled a power supply out of the closet and the zoom records just fine through that interface.  same buzz as the roland ( so thats the interface) but its generally gateable on cleans!  lets check out high gain.  Oh! and soem of the noise goes away when I touch the strings.  Oh and the znr on the metallica patch makes it totally not problematic even through that interface.  NICE!  This is a total winner imho 

Option 9: Headphone amp with soem adapters?

Option 10: Zoom to guitar-USB cable I just got a guitar cable straight to USB cable from amazon!  Using that fromteh zoom to garageband and all of a sudden i can use the high gain (although they are still problematic they are usable and the noise gate actually catches most of it!!!)  its a totallyd ifferent level and everything seems clearer. 

option 11: Guitar to Guitar-uSB cable to garageband.  First thing I noticed: The clean sounds are crystal clear and beautiful.  There is no audible hiss which is amazing.  I dont like that its not a right angle plug.  I cant hold it on this couch chair without torqueiing it unfortunately. I dont sense any latency.  play a note and let it hold on and when it dies a little hiss goes away thanks to the noise gate and you can hear that it went away because it became a bit more silent but not because there was noticeable hiss prior.    I plugged a right angle extension in and it works great and makes it way more comfortable.
Crunch: British invasion put a blanket on the speaker.  In crunch theres still a digital noise gate sound and a background hiss.  I wonder if its this guitar?  or maybe the room?  or maybe its just the amps and maybe I could get better amp sims?  Heartbroken is awesome It even cleans up with the volumen knob.  Now: speaking of the knob its noisy and this picks up every bit of that noise.  Royal Rock is real nice singing tone.   Startlit Cavern is a great effect.  American stack crunch (in distortions) is so noisy I cant even touhc my volume knob without terrible drum noises.  once you start playing it merely sounds muffled and crappy. ugh.   Not usable.
all of the distortions seemed muffled.  They also all have terrible fry sizzle.  The sound of hair metal harmonics is actually really good but the noise is such that after every few notes its like a honking  becasue really the amplified noise is SO BAD that ... well ... before it can figure out that you stopped playing its amplified a bunch of it = honk  Modern british metal has great tone and sustain but tons of fry and super loud noise.  Stadium Spread sounds awesome with just a little sizzle when quiet and not touching the strings.    Weird.  While I was playing I got latency.  it crackled a few times.    That was on Stadium Spread.  
WHOA Update!   A ton of hte noise was coming from the power cable being plugged into my mac.  Now that its on battery for the moment there arent tons of weird noises just a background hiss which is totally workable and normal for an amp!  NO!  That was only in stadium spread which is great now but in like Time to shred, its unworkable even without those noises.    I think stadium spread had so much processing it couldnt process it at full live speed haha.  Well maybe its just having trouble keeping up with so many different amp tracks even if they are all on mute.   The hair metal harmonics if it werent for hte noise has the best two handed tapping tone i've ever personally ygotten tbh.   
I tried it with the apple brand power adapter and I believe there was less noise.  However.  There was still an unusable amount of noise for the high gain amp models.



Notes: I haven't found anything which makes this crappy little usb audio adapter usable with high gain garageband sounds the noise floor is HUGE I guess.   it kind of works for crunch though.
Notes: Zoom power from USB from my computer is absolutely terrible and unusable.  Also from the power supply that powers my computer.  totally ususable when sent to my interface.  it sounds like heavy machinery
Zoom Tips: Fender clean in zoom with chicken picken in gb is great!  Great sound for certain solos: metallica, guitarvol8, Clean Multiphaseamp in GB.  


I suspect the noise I got from teh zoom using usb power (I also later heard the same sound from the usb instrument cable) might be a fierce ground loop.

Mar 13:

Option 12: This cable with a usb ground loop eliminator.  This could be snake oil I dont know and you might have to get the external power supply.  So if I got a totally external audio interface and plugged that in would it be crystal clear?

Option 13: I could try the american Sound pedal into the usb cable to see if that changes things electrically or wrt noise.  

Qusetioiion: is there ANY way to get a crystal clear signal into this macbook via the usbc ports?  Maybe via the vypyr?  Maybe via some other USB audio interface?  IT doesnt have to be a guitar.  maybe a mic?

Questiiion: What if I plugged into another outlet?  
What if I bought the ifi defender+?  
What if I bought that with its quiet power supply?  
What if I bought an expensive audio interface with a ground plug and plugged it in a different outlet?  
Would I get completely quiet operation when plugged into USB?  
What if I just had a different powered hub?  Rumor has it this wont help see heksogens comments https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhzeCacFJbQ
What if I powered the USB from another outlet?  
What if I used this cable with my pc?  Would it have the same sounds or different sounds?  
What if I bought the $99 ADJ POW-R BAR65 with grounded power and a USB Hub?  Review says it doesnt work with mac even with 3rd party cable
What if I plugged an ungrounded usb hub into a grounded power strip?
If I buy the idefender and the isilencer and the iPower will I be able to use this USB guitar cable with virtually zero noise on high gain amp models?
What is the cheapest audio interface with a fat external power brick
What if I bought the fancy usbc interface to compare?
What if I also bought the fancy usb interface with fat external power brick?  (Maybe the laney?  I kind of want that one anyway lol)
What if I also bought the usbc to guitar cable direct?
What if I plugged this cable into the OTHER side of my laptop?  No real difference.  different ports seemed to provide different crap noises at different times.
What if I plugged it into an externally grounded usb hub?
What if I changed the interface settings in audio/midi settings? 
Can I get low noise from ANY audio interface?  Pretty low noise from the vypyr vip1 actually.  twingreen, Pregain7, high9, post1, fxbypass, itsa  low volume but its pretty quiet and you can play high gain amp models with decent sound and not really usable but not god awful noise.  lots of noise sizzle.  Its jsut -91 on the noisie gate to get rid of it.    It mostly sounds like pickup noise.  when the pickups are down there is less noise but not no noise theres still a hiss.  Turning the volume all the way down on the vypyr and its gone entirely.  
What if I plugged into the american sound (battery powered) and from there into the usb cable?  Super noisy but a different sound than straight into the guitar but not better.  


Update: Apr 17
The boss works great into plugins like amplitube.  There is still noise but its just what I would expect from a guitar amp.  The green cable still sounds terrible through amplitube.  Theres a kind of HUGE noise floor.
