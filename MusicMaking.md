- ChordChord lets you make chord progressions.  You define the key, instrument, arpeggiation, tempo, scale, etc and it will generate chord progressions.  This could be used to generate chords for entire songs very quickly.  Pro version ($5/mo) exports to midi which could then be loaded into garage band.
- Sampulator is a really cool rhythm machine.  It uses the keyboard with easy recording and playback (shift and space).  No export though.
- [Hookpad](https://www.hooktheory.com/hookpad/app) is so cool you get to lay out chord progression and it plays them for you.  Its great for songwriting because it keeps you in the key.  If you want to export directly you have to purchase for $5. (thats just for one month) but then it can go to MIDI or guitartab or sheet music.  One really cool feature is you just type 1-7 with your keys but if you get up to 7 and go right back to 1 it assumes you're trying to go up an octave!  Thats so intuitive!  Its got a magic chord feature (only available a few times in the free version) that you can use twice that fills in a chord and tells you what pop songs used that chord in that situation. 
- [Autochords](https://autochords.com/) generates chord progressions in any key with different feels

This is a great program with a funky interface.  Its really cool how you can use layers and how you can introduce chords.  I wish it had some kind of automatic arpeggiation feature but maybe it does or maybe theres an easy way to use what it has to do that.  I don't know how to explicitly save or load and scrolling around is unusual.  I dont know what most of the buttons do.  

## Learning ##
* Right click switches layers.  You can also click the box button in the top left and select a layer from there. 
* Middle click and drag on a note to lower the attack


# DAWs and VSTs #
I was looking for free or cheap DAWs to use VSTs with because there are so many cool VSTs that I want to fiddle with.  Well first I figured out that you don't need a DAW that you can use VSTs with a little host program like savihost.

## Using VSTs ##
To use VSTs you need a host (some or many come as standalone packages as well but you can't assume that they will for sure) and a good way to do that is using a DAW.  Here is a list of [free VST hosts (including DAWs)](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/2011/05/16/bpb-freeware-studio-best-free-vst-host-applications/)

* Perhaps the easiest way to use a VST plugin is to use [Savihost](https://www.hermannseib.com/english/savihost.htm).  Just rename this savihost.exe to the name of the plugin and go.  It also lets you record to wav files very easily so its super easy to make a quick synth sound for a game. Oh and it looks like it comes built in with a keyboard on the bottom so you can test it out with key typing.  For the first vst I used I took for granted that it had that built in.  One side effect is that I can't use the keyboard while I adjust the values on the vst also the keyboard isnt instantly responsive..  A tiny midi keyboard and one of the free daws might be best for that. Its cool that it lets you save the entire configuration of teh VST and load it up again anytime. 


## Free or Inexpensive DAWs ##
* [Cakewalk by Bandlab](https://www.bandlab.com/products/cakewalk) which is apparently basically the latest version of Sonar but with none of the bundled extras.  Windows only.  To use it you just have to sign up for their online account which has [no annoying or nagging ads](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/2015/11/11/free-daw-software/) This seems to be the most fully featured of all.
* [Protools First] (https://www.avid.com/pro-tools-first) this is free cloud based music creation with protools level stuff, and with a few limitations: Requires broadband (you apparently can't save to your hard drive), 16 max tracks, 96khz max sample rate, and 3 total projects.  It comes with 23 plugins and 3.1GB of included sounds.  If you want to upgrade to the full version of Pro Tools which changes all of these limitations (cloud is limited to 1GB) its $30/month.  Mac or PC
* [Podium Free](https://zynewave.com/podium-free/) this is considered the [undisputed champion of freeware DAWs](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/2015/01/23/pro-tools-free/).    Limitations are no ReWire plugins, No surround sound, 64bit mixer engine disabled, midi input and output limited to 1, and only one CPU core will be used for all plugins.  I wonder if other DAWs actually use all of the CPU cores or if this is an advanced feature of Podium commercial anyway.  Unbelievable that this is by one guy.  The full version has a very small file size, and includes a demo so you can try it out (which affects your outputted tracks until you register).  Full version is $50.  Windows Only
* [Studio One Prime](https://shop.presonus.com/Studio-One-4-Prime) is [highly regarded](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/2015/01/23/pro-tools-free/) along with Podium Free as one of the best. Only runs on 64 bit OSs.   Full version is $100.  Windows or Mac
* Others to investigate: Traktion (Waveform is the $99 full version) fast efficient workflow but has a steeper learning curve.
* Apparently Garageband can use VSTs now?
* Music Maker is like GarageBand on Windows (VST support isn't clear)
* Logic Pro is $199
* Reaper is free to try (and apparently never expires) and only $60 for full version
* [Soundbridge](http://soundbridge.io) is free for PC or Mac and looks great but doesnt have midi typing
* MuLab $69

## Chiptunes ##
* Renoise obviously
* [Sunvox](https://www.warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/) - Tracker + a thousand other things for pc and ios.
* [OpenMPT](https://openmpt.org) I have not had good luck with this tracker, but it seems to be the most popular one for some time.  VST Plugin compatible too.  Recent updates too.  On second look it doesnt look bad, but I dont know what instruments i could use except I do because I could use instruments from my favorite amiga mods.
