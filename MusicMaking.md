- ChordChord lets you make chord progressions.  You define the key, instrument, arpeggiation, tempo, scale, etc and it will generate chord progressions.  This could be used to generate chords for entire songs very quickly.  Pro version ($5/mo) exports to midi which could then be loaded into garage band.
- Sampulator is a really cool rhythm machine.  It uses the keyboard with easy recording and playback (shift and space).  No export though.
