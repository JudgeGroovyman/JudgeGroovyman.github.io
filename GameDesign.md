# Learned from Amiga games

Back in the day they thought that making home games should be like making games for the arcade at home.  They thought people would want the exact arcade experience at home.  And they thought that people wanted the games to be hard to give them a challenge.  To some degree they were right about all this but in the name of making games hard and in the name of faithfully bringing arcade games into the home publishers and developers regularly committed some cardinal sins some of which I have identified and will list here:
1. Limited number of credits for the home game.  This one completely baffles me: If you wanted to bring the arcade experience home then absolutely do that.  Let people put in as many virtual quarters as they want.  This ruined so many games back then it blows my mind.  So many people would have had so much more fun if this completely artificial limitation hadn't been introduced.  And the weird part is it wouldn't have stopped hardcore players from beating it in 3 continues (true it would have changed their motivation curve and changed the satisfaction they got from the built in challenge, but that could have been mitigated by adding a simple mode in the options that limited continues to 3!?!) but it just would have given more casual players more fun, would have let them see the whole game (which is a lot of why I always wanted to play games: to see and experience and live in the content and world of fantasy they had created for me) and would have given real value to customers from the games they bought.  As it is in many cases (mine certainly) people bought a game and gave up because they made no real progress for hours while repeatedly having to play the same sections of the game (level 1) over and over.
2. Difficult or impossible to play without taking hits.  The better you do the fewer hits you should take and the player should always know that if he does it very well he doesnt take any hits.  It should be a matter of degree (I took a little damage because I didnt do it perfectly, or I took a lot of damage because I haven't figured out how to avoid damage -  which is often revealed by you getting shot when standing in one place os you know to stand in another) or puzzle solving (how do I avoid all of the shots, what is this enemies attack pattern so I can avoid their shots).
3. Difficulty shouldn't come from having to do a few things perfectly or you die.  Like falling in pits in zelda 2 or castlevania.  its annoying to fall into pits in mario but in mario theres not a life bar so hits kill you (exceptions granted) but in zelda and castlevania most things hurt you a bit but those pits kill you instantly? and the worst part about those is knockback into pits. That should be game-illegal. Same with bad dudes on the train level and golden axe when you have to jump those pits, and double dragon on SMS and NES, except in those games theres not just a simple jump, you have to do a simple attack combo to jump those pits and if you slip up just a bit you die.  That can and has changed a great run into a failed run from just a few little mistakes.  Your mistakes shouldn't have that much gravity (no pit-pun intended) unless its naturally built into the game (like a final boss or something)
4. Difficulty should be in the process of doing hard things the game not in the process of doing hard things for 30 minutes without making too many mistakes.  Checkpoints fix this and checkpoint balance is an art.  Lets try using a trainer and a walkthrough (that came with the WHDLoad) 
5. Tip for level designers.  dont put enemies in places that the player cant shoot them.  Best example: Enemies below you on a downward slope if the player cant shoot down and forward and at exactly the correct angle.  Second best example: enemies that are below the players shot line when he cant duck.  Unless jumping over them is a clear solution and jumping is well done and expected in your game and theres a clear and safe place to land dont put short enemies in front of the player like that.  Metroid is an example which sort of did it right. imho it should have made them hittable from standing position butsince samus cant duck she is encouraged to jump over them or later bomb them and both of those solutions work.  In Cool spot amiga or assassin amiga you are going down a slope and there are blind things beneath you that you cant shoot so as soon as  you see them you jump them only to have them track your position and you land righ ton them or you land on something else which was positioned right after it.  Jumps to avoid damage should be clear and visible or just give the player a little break and only put enemies on upslopes and make the level a bit longer.  Another example of this is Superfrog where the shot only kills flying enemies because the rest are too low to be hit by it.



# My Philosophy on Difficulty #
* Games that were fun in the eighties were partially fun because of the difficulty
	* Which creates a consequent reward and satisfaction and fulfillment in the process of improving your skill and eventually getting good at and possibly beating them or even ‘mastering’ them
	* And this difficulty evolved more or less directly from the video arcades which generally made more money if the game had just the right difficulty
	* It made its way into home games and difficult became the norm and the standard
	* And there was certainly some value to that since for a dedicated player a difficult game provided more play time for a dedicated player since they would have to play it many times to master it and make progress
	* Not to mention the satisfaction mentioned above
* But it didn’t have to be this way
	* For home games and conversions they did not have to be so difficult.  You had already paid the $40.  
	* I don’t mean that every game creator that made their game difficult in the eighties was wrong to do so, far from it since that also provided a perceived value for money that some players and reviewers required for credibility
	* I do believe most games would have benefited from a legitimate easy mode which had unlimited lives or continues or something like that
	* For many gamers given the amount of time or skill or entertainment-patience they had me included most games were unfortunately out of reach for them which meant that you would buy it and play it for a while and the difficulty was so high even on easy mode that it provided a barrier to entry that was too much to overcome
	* Especially if many of the tricks were used such as restarting the game after you died too many times.  
	* This stuff always boggled my mind and I felt it was a waste and a shame and I still do
* For these reasons I like the idea of games that provide much of the joy of the core gameplay of those games without the same difficulty level.
	* Games with fair difficulty meet a need I have had since the 80s
	* I’ve always wanted to experience the fun core gameplay of pac man but with a chance to make real progress through a story or scenario and get immersed the way I did with Super Mario Bro’s. 
	* I always wanted to be able to play Smash TV and Robotron without cheap deaths
	* Fundamentally I always wanted to be able to put unlimited quarters into the games I bought for my home
	* And I always wanted for them to be easy enough that I knew that with a just little reasonable amount of patience and practice and retries I could make legitimate progress
	* And I always wanted for my progress to be saved between play sessions somehow 
	* And I always wanted for me to be able to play games with confidence knowing that I wouldn’t get stuck on something impossible for me and making the game somewhat of a waste
	* And I always wanted to play games that I could see all of the content if I just gave it enough time
* What is my kind of hard
	* Having to retry to learn things about the game is great
	* Learning new things about how the enemies re act or how the bosses attack or how the levels are laid out is fine and great and fun
	* Learning and developing strategies for getting past groups of enemies is fun and rewarding 
	* Sometimes even learning where traps are located and what to do to avoid them (even the hard way) is ok if it doesn’t punish you by putting you too far back
* What’s too hard
	* Expecting you to upgrade your skills to progress in the game is too much
	* Punishing you by putting you far back is cheap
* Some of this can’t be Known or balanced 
	* True that there are infinite skill sets so you can’t hit it right for everyone 
	* I’m aiming at gamers who have experience playing games for a while but who haven’t beat a lot of games because they were too hard
	* And some games I’m aiming at gamers who have no experience
* Not for hardcore competitive gamers and that’s ok
	* This may mean that to beat it competitively you have to beat it under a certain time or with a certain accuracy
	* Or it may mean that competitive players won’t find much to keep them occupied 
	* It also may mean that for some people the games are not very interesting 
	
# Continue Structures #

Much of the problems with games is about the continue structure of the game.  One simple way to do it is separate into shortish levels and let you try that level as many times as you want until you beat it with no passwords or anything.  its tragic to me that so many games could have done something simple like this back then but made the game so hard that half of the people didnt play it.  An important part of the reason that people pirated games in the 80s was to fix their difficulty.


Continue Structures that work and can be fair
1. Save at any moment
2. Save between levels
3. Save between small sets of levels
4. Level Select: I think this continue structure is ok: A few lives per level with level select.  Thats an ok continue structure.  You can even make it so level select is greyed out until you beat the previous (unlocking). 

# Like A Performance #
Also making games is like performing or playing guitar at a concert.  I could think about them as a performance.

# Good ideas #
Character entry like bad dudes where the player sprite is the pointer to the letter.  It worked great and was fun to do!


# Sounds
Sounds create satisfaction.  Each sound should be satisfying and each action should have an associated satisfying sound.  The motion and action of thew world in response to your actions should also be satisfying but thats not about sounds.


# My stories are like this:
1. Hero experiences apparently unrelated bad events
2. Hero wins in the end but only because the bad things  turned out to be blessings in disguise.
3. Enemy turns out to be someone the hero didn't expect (Betrayal)

# Game Designer Tips #
## Designing games like Curse of the Moon
### Allow a switch of difficulty ###
I loved it so much on stage one because even though I had to continue it let me switch to casual mode! 
That let me get all of the enemy patterns down and get confidence I could do the stage properly and then it was just a matter of doing it better to beat the veteran mode
It was so satisfying!  
The big differences are: it let me switch and
It doesn’t make me choose at the beginning and feel stuck with my choice and scared that I’ll never be able to do it
And also that it meets me at my level instead of expecting me to be better than I am right now

## Designing games like The Bards Tale ##
### Fulfilling their destiny ###
Give players the experience of working hard to become more than they are.  The experience of fulfilling their destiny of being great.  Tell stories about that (or the opposite for enemies or npcs)
“How do I make a game interesting well let’s just come up with a million things people can do ... people don’t look at that correctly.  They should be thinking what experience do I want to have and how do we give them that, rather than how do I throw more graphics in or how do I give them more content. It’s not the amount and it’s not the complexity, it really is more the engagement.”
Being in sole control of a world is so awesome and fulfilling and working with other people can be so frustrating
From the Bards Tale GDc talk at the end

"I don't know much, but I know this: When you make a video game, you're gonna rebuild the tutorial about 30 times. If you are lucky."

# Making games #

# What are games made of 
I would like to re-make some games. rationale: I would like to show myself that I can do it and I would like to have the fun of having the game to play.  To do that what will I need?

### Pac Man on C64

### Tetris

### Rock N Roll Racing

### Thunderstrike

### Peter's Quest

### Gauntlet / The Chaos Engine

### Doom
With lots of high Jumping and platforming and dodging and raining destruction down from above.
I actually already made this exact game in coppercube.

### A thousand different interesting trippy effects generators

### Hogans Alley

### Smash TV

### RPG

### Beat Saber

### Serious Sam

### Zork

### Hoi

### Wonderboy III: The Dragon's Trap

## Thoughts
### Combinations
Maybe I could combine some of these: Gauntlet (Find keys and food and the exit, enemy generators), Smash TV (control scheme, map based), Thunderstrike (Collecting Treasures from generators, transporting them to safe zones), Rock N Roll Racing (Fast paced rollaball based racing controls over tracks where things changed every lap)

# Elements of Game Design


# Structural elements

### Doom ###
Here are some of the elements that the doom engine and its surrounding ecosystem provides game developers out of the box without having to develop any of these things themselves.  Note: To be clear I mean no disrespect to game developers who make games using the doom engine since they still have to design the maps and layout all of the beasties and powerups and everything and do that for every difficulty level and playtest it all so theres still a lot of involvement and I have huge respect for everyone who does this.  Also there is a non trivial learning curve to get all the different bits and bobs hooked up and settings set in just the right way and to learn how to do all of that hooking up and setting and to learn to use all of the tools.  Its generally easier to learn to use a well designed and mature tool than to develop a tool yourself from scratch but that doesnt mean its trivial (although for some people I bet it is pretty trivial).  I don't have any insight into how well all of those processes are documented but my guess is they are documented very well as of 2019.  Also many game developers add their own textures and things so they are investing their own art into the process too.
