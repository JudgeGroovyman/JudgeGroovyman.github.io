# Learned from Amiga games

Back in the day they thought that making home games should be like making games for the arcade at home.  They thought people would want the exact arcade experience at home.  And they thought that people wanted the games to be hard to give them a challenge.  To some degree they were right about all this but in the name of making games hard and in the name of faithfully bringing arcade games into the home publishers and developers regularly committed some cardinal sins some of which I have identified and will list here:
1. Limited number of credits for the home game.  This one completely baffles me: If you wanted to bring the arcade experience home then absolutely do that.  Let people put in as many virtual quarters as they want.  This ruined so many games back then it blows my mind.  So many people would have had so much more fun if this completely artificial limitation hadn't been introduced.  And the weird part is it wouldn't have stopped hardcore players from beating it in 3 continues (true it would have changed their motivation curve and changed the satisfaction they got from the built in challenge, but that could have been mitigated by adding a simple mode in the options that limited continues to 3!?!) but it just would have given more casual players more fun, would have let them see the whole game (which is a lot of why I always wanted to play games: to see and experience and live in the content and world of fantasy they had created for me) and would have given real value to customers from the games they bought.  As it is in many cases (mine certainly) people bought a game and gave up because they made no real progress for hours while repeatedly having to play the same sections of the game (level 1) over and over.
2. Difficult or impossible to play without taking hits.  The better you do the fewer hits you should take and the player should always know that if he does it very well he doesnt take any hits.  It should be a matter of degree (I took a little damage because I didnt do it perfectly, or I took a lot of damage because I haven't figured out how to avoid damage -  which is often revealed by you getting shot when standing in one place os you know to stand in another) or puzzle solving (how do I avoid all of the shots, what is this enemies attack pattern so I can avoid their shots).
3. Difficulty shouldn't come from having to do a few things perfectly or you die.  Like falling in pits in zelda 2 or castlevania.  its annoying to fall into pits in mario but in mario theres not a life bar so hits kill you (exceptions granted) but in zelda and castlevania most things hurt you a bit but those pits kill you instantly? and the worst part about those is knockback into pits. That should be game-illegal. Same with bad dudes on the train level and golden axe when you have to jump those pits, and double dragon on SMS and NES, except in those games theres not just a simple jump, you have to do a simple attack combo to jump those pits and if you slip up just a bit you die.  That can and has changed a great run into a failed run from just a few little mistakes.  Your mistakes shouldn't have that much gravity (no pit-pun intended) unless its naturally built into the game (like a final boss or something)
4. Difficulty should be in the process of doing hard things the game not in the process of doing hard things for 30 minutes without making too many mistakes.  Checkpoints fix this and checkpoint balance is an art.  Lets try using a trainer and a walkthrough (that came with the WHDLoad) 
5. Tip for level designers.  dont put enemies in places that the player cant shoot them.  Best example: Enemies below you on a downward slope if the player cant shoot down and forward and at exactly the correct angle.  Second best example: enemies that are below the players shot line when he cant duck.  Unless jumping over them is a clear solution and jumping is well done and expected in your game and theres a clear and safe place to land dont put short enemies in front of the player like that.  Metroid is an example which sort of did it right. imho it should have made them hittable from standing position butsince samus cant duck she is encouraged to jump over them or later bomb them and both of those solutions work.  In Cool spot amiga or assassin amiga you are going down a slope and there are blind things beneath you that you cant shoot so as soon as  you see them you jump them only to have them track your position and you land righ ton them or you land on something else which was positioned right after it.  Jumps to avoid damage should be clear and visible or just give the player a little break and only put enemies on upslopes and make the level a bit longer.  Another example of this is Superfrog where the shot only kills flying enemies because the rest are too low to be hit by it.
6. Collision difficulty should come from achievable things and situations.  Thinking back to Mario there should be obvious indications when you get hit (in mario he gets small again or loses a power) and you shouldn't be presented with arrangements of enemies which you can't reasonably get through without taking a hit.  Tricky jumping and platforming should be reserved for end game or secrets or bonuses. The main path should be do able if you figure out the strategy (come from above to bounce on their heads, jump on the first and over the second, etc.)  Zool didn't always do this very well.  Even on level 1 it had too many situations where you had to either make a perfect jump and shoot or take a hit.  Having one of these hard situations per level as a sort of a boss is fine, but sprinkling them throughout on level one isn't a good balance.  
7. Don't introduce too many mechanics in one level.  Zool introduces dozens in the first level alone.  Jump, shoot, slide, jump attack, (its way harder if you don't know the spin attack), bounce off platform, disappearing platforms, shooting enemies, flying enemies who come at you at strange angles and random patterns, respawning enemies on a small platform (so you have to always be watching for that because they respawn as soon as they are off screen), more, spin attack from the top of the jumping platforms (if you don't spin from the top of the platform you will blindly find out that there are enemies that its going to jump you into), have to know you can punch the continue signs, wall stick, wall jump on one wall to climb it (required to master to get through the beginning of the first level) Shadow powerup, many different enemy types, high jump, continue signs (that need to be specifically punched) on the edge of a platform that you can't get back up if you accidentally are going any faster than slow and miss punching it.   Large stair platforms that go down but with spikes on the corners so you have to make perfect jumps to survive it.  Arbitrary time limit.  Actual super tricky jumps.  fast slippery movement.  A pit that if you fall in you die, pits that if you fall in you don't die but its a puzzle to get out because you have to perfect jump over spikes on either side but when you do theres a blind enemy falling on you from above so you will get hit.  Level 2 has a jump where the edge has spikes so you have to jump early and blind, but when you do you can't help but land on more spikes or maybe land on the wall above the spikes where you have to wall jump up through flying enemies who will kill you into a barrage of shots from a pink donut with legs.  
8. Provide many paths to the exit.  Provide many exits.  


# My Philosophy on Difficulty #
* Games that were fun in the eighties were partially fun because of the difficulty
	* Which creates a consequent reward and satisfaction and fulfillment in the process of improving your skill and eventually getting good at and possibly beating them or even ‘mastering’ them
	* And this difficulty evolved more or less directly from the video arcades which generally made more money if the game had just the right difficulty
	* It made its way into home games and difficult became the norm and the standard
	* And there was certainly some value to that since for a dedicated player a difficult game provided more play time for a dedicated player since they would have to play it many times to master it and make progress
	* Not to mention the satisfaction mentioned above
* But it didn’t have to be this way
	* For home games and conversions they did not have to be so difficult.  You had already paid the $40.  
	* I don’t mean that every game creator that made their game difficult in the eighties was wrong to do so, far from it since that also provided a perceived value for money that some players and reviewers required for credibility
	* I do believe most games would have benefited from a legitimate easy mode which had unlimited lives or continues or something like that
	* For many gamers given the amount of time or skill or entertainment-patience they had me included most games were unfortunately out of reach for them which meant that you would buy it and play it for a while and the difficulty was so high even on easy mode that it provided a barrier to entry that was too much to overcome
	* Especially if many of the tricks were used such as restarting the game after you died too many times.  
	* This stuff always boggled my mind and I felt it was a waste and a shame and I still do
* For these reasons I like the idea of games that provide much of the joy of the core gameplay of those games without the same difficulty level.
	* Games with fair difficulty meet a need I have had since the 80s
	* I’ve always wanted to experience the fun core gameplay of pac man but with a chance to make real progress through a story or scenario and get immersed the way I did with Super Mario Bro’s. 
	* I always wanted to be able to play Smash TV and Robotron without cheap deaths
	* Fundamentally I always wanted to be able to put unlimited quarters into the games I bought for my home
	* And I always wanted for them to be easy enough that I knew that with a just little reasonable amount of patience and practice and retries I could make legitimate progress
	* And I always wanted for my progress to be saved between play sessions somehow 
	* And I always wanted for me to be able to play games with confidence knowing that I wouldn’t get stuck on something impossible for me and making the game somewhat of a waste
	* And I always wanted to play games that I could see all of the content if I just gave it enough time
* What is my kind of hard
	* Having to retry to learn things about the game is great
	* Learning new things about how the enemies re act or how the bosses attack or how the levels are laid out is fine and great and fun
	* Learning and developing strategies for getting past groups of enemies is fun and rewarding 
	* Sometimes even learning where traps are located and what to do to avoid them (even the hard way) is ok if it doesn’t punish you by putting you too far back
* What’s too hard
	* Expecting you to upgrade your skills to progress in the game is too much
	* Punishing you by putting you far back is cheap
* Some of this can’t be Known or balanced 
	* True that there are infinite skill sets so you can’t hit it right for everyone 
	* I’m aiming at gamers who have experience playing games for a while but who haven’t beat a lot of games because they were too hard
	* And some games I’m aiming at gamers who have no experience
* Not for hardcore competitive gamers and that’s ok
	* This may mean that to beat it competitively you have to beat it under a certain time or with a certain accuracy
	* Or it may mean that competitive players won’t find much to keep them occupied 
	* It also may mean that for some people the games are not very interesting 
	
	
I'm playing the RPG Avadon and I chose casual mode, and all of the battles so far have been very very easy.  I like that for me for now, while I simultaneously recognize that the battles aren't very interesting this way since they are so easy, there is some balance of difficulty and interest that is a hard line to walk, however even on casual mode, if you were to do things wrong you would still die.  There are still loss conditions.  There is also the play of figuring out where to go, who to fight, who to talk to, what to pick up, what to equip, what to buy and sell, and puzzles to solve (how to enter the secret lair near the dragon - I Looked everywhere, didnt see it, went there several times and didnt see it, finally saw it.  Soemtimes its about looking at the right thing from teh right perspective and clicking on everything.  There was even a red herring that I tried to open for a long time), etc.  If you want more in game time spent then casual isnt the best option for you, but I would prefer a shorter funner game than a long one personally.    The boss battles can still be lost pretty easily without much trouble even on casual.

# Continue Structures #

Much of the problems with games is about the continue structure of the game.  One simple way to do it is separate into shortish levels and let you try that level as many times as you want until you beat it with no passwords or anything.  its tragic to me that so many games could have done something simple like this back then but made the game so hard that half of the people didnt play it.  An important part of the reason that people pirated games in the 80s was to fix their difficulty.


Continue Structures that work and can be fair
1. Save at any moment
2. Save between levels
3. Save between small sets of levels
4. Level Select: I think this continue structure is ok: A few lives per level with level select.  Thats an ok continue structure.  You can even make it so level select is greyed out until you beat the previous (unlocking). 

# Like A Performance #
Also making games is like performing or playing guitar at a concert.  I could think about them as a performance.

# Good ideas #
Character entry like bad dudes where the player sprite is the pointer to the letter.  It worked great and was fun to do!


# Sounds
Sounds create satisfaction.  Each sound should be satisfying and each action should have an associated satisfying sound.  The motion and action of thew world in response to your actions should also be satisfying but thats not about sounds.


# My stories are like this:
1. Hero experiences apparently unrelated bad events
2. Hero wins in the end but only because the bad things  turned out to be blessings in disguise.
3. Enemy turns out to be someone the hero didn't expect (Betrayal)

# Game Designer Tips #
## Designing games like Curse of the Moon
### Allow a switch of difficulty ###
I loved it so much on stage one because even though I had to continue it let me switch to casual mode! 
That let me get all of the enemy patterns down and get confidence I could do the stage properly and then it was just a matter of doing it better to beat the veteran mode
It was so satisfying!  
The big differences are: it let me switch and
It doesn’t make me choose at the beginning and feel stuck with my choice and scared that I’ll never be able to do it
And also that it meets me at my level instead of expecting me to be better than I am right now

## Designing games like The Bards Tale ##
### Fulfilling their destiny ###
Give players the experience of working hard to become more than they are.  The experience of fulfilling their destiny of being great.  Tell stories about that (or the opposite for enemies or npcs)
“How do I make a game interesting well let’s just come up with a million things people can do ... people don’t look at that correctly.  They should be thinking what experience do I want to have and how do we give them that, rather than how do I throw more graphics in or how do I give them more content. It’s not the amount and it’s not the complexity, it really is more the engagement.”
Being in sole control of a world is so awesome and fulfilling and working with other people can be so frustrating
From the Bards Tale GDc talk at the end

## Designing games from Chris Natsuume ##
"I don't know much, but I know this: When you make a video game, you're gonna rebuild the tutorial about 30 times. If you are lucky."

3. Approx 20 different things in a level make it interesting but not too diverse (Thats what I learned from Chris)

# Making games #

# What are games made of 
I would like to re-make some games. rationale: I would like to show myself that I can do it and I would like to have the fun of having the game to play.  To do that what will I need?

### Pac Man on C64

### Tetris

### Rock N Roll Racing

### Thunderstrike

### Peter's Quest

### Gauntlet / The Chaos Engine

### Doom
With lots of high Jumping and platforming and dodging and raining destruction down from above.
I actually already made this exact game in coppercube.

### A thousand different interesting trippy effects generators

### Hogans Alley

### Smash TV

### RPG

### Beat Saber

### Serious Sam

### Zork

### Hoi

### Wonderboy III: The Dragon's Trap

### Ninja Gaiden NES 
This game as-is is fundamentally a fantastic game, however the game as-is should have been the hard mode of the game, and there should have been a normal mode (and ideally an easy mode) and there are a few simple ways they could have made normal mode more fair for almost everyone than hard mode:


1. Don't make dying on boss on level 6-4 take you back to level 6-1.  it should let you retry from 6-3 and it still would have been a great challenge to get through 6-3 and all of the bosses.
2. More available Ninpo throughout the game but especially levels 5 and 6 (3x per pickup perhaps at least on 5-6?) and some opportunity to pump up quite a bit right before the boss. 
3. More life powerups, once in the middle of each level and of course at the end or beginning. Absolutely offer a life refill everytime you enter the boss room instead of just the first time you ever enter the boss room.
4. double iframes on knockback
5. remove 2-4 of the most obviously annoying birds and 2-4 other obviously annoying enemies from levels 5-6.  Just a few fewer key enemies would make a big difference between fair and cheap/unfair (cheap is where if you play casually you get juggled, reserve all of the situations where you get juggled to death for playing casually for hard mode)
6. 5-6 lives could be the only difference between easy and normal mode
7. For everything that shoots (especially those fish) make them shoot just a little slower ... maybe 20% slower?  Especially those rocket guys shooting stars. they should be spaced apart further.  It would still be hard but more fair.
8. All level times that are tight at all should be doubled.  At least the final bosses times should be doubled.  (easy mode - no timer)
9. The manual should have a few tips in the back: 1. Weapon selection and ninpo collection is critical 2. Spin slash is far more powerful than any other weapon.  as its written it implies that the windmill throwingstar is the super powerful one and that spin slash is most useful only in specific circumstances above the enemy.  3.  Try all weapons against the bosses to see which is most powerful.  4. When you have the spin slash but don't want to use it press down when slashing.  5. 
10. You shouldn't lose your ninpo or special weapon when you die in normal mode.  Even if it resets at the beginning of each Act.  
11. Ideally close off a few of the death pits below ladders in level 6 to the degree that while jumps can kill you, tricky wall jumps can't because those are a skill unto themselves and you shouldn't be punished for not having perfected the most advanced use of those when theres not large areas of training for just that technique (which there isn't).  for most of the game using the wall jump is relatively forgiving but then just when things get hardest, and when the practice of those skills are hardest to get to, you have to magically know a skill you haven't been forced to practice before in more forgiving circumstances.  


Most of the complaint is about levels 5 and 6 honestly. 1-4 are difficult but generally clumsily fair. 

If they had done nothing more than make more levels like 1-4 they could have had a whole even longer game that would have been difficult and satisfying

, possibly hardmode should have been unlockable by beating the normal mode.  The normal mode should have been very similar but had an ending which encouraged you to beat the game on hard mode.

P.S. accidentally sticking to random pillars or walls on knock back sucks 

## Thoughts
### Combinations
Maybe I could combine some of these: Gauntlet (Find keys and food and the exit, enemy generators), Smash TV (control scheme, map based), Thunderstrike (Collecting Treasures from generators, transporting them to safe zones), Rock N Roll Racing (Fast paced rollaball based racing controls over tracks where things changed every lap)

# Elements of Game Design


# Structural elements

### Doom ###
Here are some of the elements that the doom engine and its surrounding ecosystem provides game developers out of the box without having to develop any of these things themselves.  Note: To be clear I mean no disrespect to game developers who make games using the doom engine since they still have to design the maps and layout all of the beasties and powerups and everything and do that for every difficulty level and playtest it all so theres still a lot of involvement and I have huge respect for everyone who does this.  Also there is a non trivial learning curve to get all the different bits and bobs hooked up and settings set in just the right way and to learn how to do all of that hooking up and setting and to learn to use all of the tools.  Its generally easier to learn to use a well designed and mature tool than to develop a tool yourself from scratch but that doesnt mean its trivial (although for some people I bet it is pretty trivial).  I don't have any insight into how well all of those processes are documented but my guess is they are documented very well as of 2019.  Also many game developers add their own textures and things so they are investing their own art into the process too.

### Roguelike ###
Roguelike

- I like the idea of playing Omega from back in the day but using a non-random seed.  Playing the same seed many times to try to beat it.  I like that idea a lot actually.  Maybe it wasn't Omega maybe it was Moria?  yes it was Moria
- Really I want the player to be able to try again forgivingly.  Try the same seed with the same
- I also want to roll my own character in Omega, and I want to use magic or an item to teleport back to the town on the ground level to save
- if I'm being perfectly honest I also want it to be easier, have fewer enemy attack patterns, or introduce them slower, or only if you choose on that run.
- I want to explore and
- And I don't want to constantly be confronted with new unfamiliar things.  I want to be able to get familiar with almost everything after a while except the maps, enemy placement, attack patterns, and what cool loot to find.  I dont want traps or tricks in my loot.  I dont want to worry all the time about traps or tricks or whether I know the potion.  I'm ok with not knowing things when the seed starts, in fact that sounds like fun, but for your given character (who should be resurrectable) (a shaman could be watching over your journeys and resurrect you back at the city when you die)  Proper punishment?  Leave all loot where you died?  bring back only what you are wearing and whats in your pockets?
- I dont want to have to learn a lot so I dont want a ton of spells or classes or at least that can suffer at first
- I definitely do not want forced descent.
- The original Rogue was nearly simple enough, but I would like to explore a whole Middle Earth sized world and somehow find my way through a quest.
- I've been playing TOME4 and its chill and so cool and interesting because I love picking up the new loot.  There IS a chance you can die, if you just stood there, but its not too hard to beat the enemies, if you were surrounded and just used buffs for like 4 turns without attacking I feel like you would die.  So there is pressure to pay attention, but at the same time, you are powerful so it doesnt take too much to overpower your foes and I like that feeling.  I like getting more and more powerful and I like getting better weapons and higher levels and that allowing me to face off against a mighty foe.  
  -   I feel like I would love a whole game like this which didnt get even that much more intense than this, but certain battles could be intense and that is fine.  Keeping the intensity high the whole game is certainly not what I am looking for 
  - If pretty much the whole game was like this and then you fight a boss and you have to survive those levels that would be fun.
  - IT could even have parts where you have to beat a boss and if you dont you start several screens back at the beginning of that level, with respawned enemies?
  - Some games have enemies that will kill you with one blast if you arent levelled properly.  I dont want my game to do that.  I want it to make clear that you will die on this level if you dont grind more ... perhaps a door key which requires you to hit the door with a certain amount of damage, and then in the hallway you have to take a hit of a certain amount and if you can take it then you get healed and move on, but if you can't you can't progress.  Have something like that every 1/4 through the game.
- Like Chrono Trigger well it could have interesting story with events and things happening and people hanging around.
- I just figured something out: I prefer single character RPGs, especially tactical ones.  Maybe I dont feel like I can keep track of everything going on otherwise.  
- Features I dont like in RPGs or Roguelikes (Nothing against them just not fun for me)
  - equipment degradation
  - Steep difficulty (progress difficult)
  - Constant battle and intensity (no peace)
  - Long time between saves
- Every 5 levels or so There is a hole in the outer wall where if you save enough cash you can hire the tube smith to install a tube that takes you right down to this level when you die
- All levels above the tube are once again populated with scaled difficulty demons so you can grind later if you just go back up a few levels


- Roguelike features I want
  - Definitely
  - Random dungeons
  - Infinite life (optional permadeath ok)
  - Nothing but you can end progress
  - A way to build up your skills if you take on a boss or level you aren't powerful enough for
  - A run that doesnt take 40-100 hrs. 
  - Simple mechanics somewhat like rogue
    - stats
    - melee
    - Ranged
    - aoe
    - dragon breath
    - potions (like in rogue) or runes (like in tome4)
    - not much more complexity
  - Life regeneration auto (like tome 4) or life from exploring or enemies or potions or items.
  - 
  - Ideally
  - Somewhere safe to retreat (an overworld like tome4 or town like moria perhaps)
  - Teleporting back to town to retreat like tome4 (but can invest in making the retreat faster)
  - Turn based
  - Character Stat Rolling (with one level undo) similar to moria
  - A limited size of dungeon like in tome4
  - Loads of loot
  - Movement like tome4
  - Auto explore like in tome 4
  - 1-6hrs is good
  - Lots of good features in tggw
  - 
  - 
  - Ambivalent
  - Perma levels (as long as theres another way to build up your skills - respawning monsters)
  - Story or Lore
  - Whether the lives are the same character as long as you keep progress
  - Skill trees
  - visibility like in tome 4 (I dont care if you can see behind trees or stones or not)
  - classes
  - races
  - progress via levelling (like tome4) vs equipment (like tome4 or tggw) vs training (like in tggw) vs quests (like tome4)
  - 
  - 
  - Definitely No
  - Permadeath (optional is fine, optional infinite lives required)
  - Potion or item identification
  - elements or different types of blights like TOME4 or any complex mechanics like that
  - food
  -

- Game Design From Zelda

  - Game design from Zelda 2
    - Name everything with creative names (all enemies, each enemies weapons, enemies of different strengths get suffixes or additional adjectives, power ups, bosses, towns, mountain ranges, castles, bridges, canyons) and document all of the enemies in the game somehow maybe on the title or attract screen if you wait too long.  Maybe it only shows you the ones you have unlocked.
    - Make a simple pattern of progression such as: explore the area you can easily get to, find the boundaries of it, find the town, heal, recharge magic, someone there will give you a clue and ask you to do a favor, go do that quest, reward is to get to talk to wise man who gives you magic, one castle in each area.  In the castle is an important item and a boss.  The boss gives you much experience, the item let’s you mechanically progress to the next area, also let’s you access secrets in the previous areas, also gives you shortcuts from the starting area to the area you are in (like the hammer or candle)
    - Enumerate how everything works: does it give exp, take away exp, how many hit points, etc. basically do all of the analysis work that Zelda dungeon has done for the player.  This gives the player a way to get deeper into the game.  Maybe don’t do all of that but do make sure it is clear to you so it can be done by players
    - Expect them to make a simple map on paper and write down any clues they found and where they found them
    - No instant death pits.  (Metroid didn’t have any instant death)
    - All upgrades are persistent (including extra lives - not many of those hidden around)
    - Important secrets (lives and life and magic blocks) for exploring every spot on the map, or for solving puzzles by following clues (one clue for one of these per town - not a quest just a clue), less important secrets (experience p bags, life and magic refills) in secret areas that you find non intuitively (like where you can walk into mountains or walls where usually you can’t)
    - No knock back!
    - Enemies do not respawn until you leave the area or building 
  - Game Design from Zelda
    - Every important secret has two clues somewhere in the world
    - Every bonus secret is hidden and has no clues (except perhaps a giveaway at the location of the secret) but rewards exploration and experimentation by handing out non essential but useful items
    - Nothing essential is hidden secretly
    - Two types of enemies: easy (brown) and hard (blue).  
    - Just a few different simple landscape props with dimension and palette swaps
    - Simple rounded blocks
    - Just a few PBR textures
    - If you beat it then you can beat the second quest in the same map which is kind of a remix game
- You WIN a the game all the way no matter how you performed
  - But then if you beat it really well then you unlock a bonus insanity or obsession or binge realm
  - Everyone needs to be able to say that they won it
    - Maybe even 99 lives to make it have some consequences and a motivation to perform
    - But 99 lives even if you run out you will know it wasn’t because the game was unfair
  - Not everyone needs to be able to say that the 100% it
  - “Psychologically, challenge is important for catharsis.  Victory is sweeter when there’s a clear and looming presence of failure.”
- A really good design should bring with it a moment of immense satisfaction in which everything falls into place, and you’re amazed at how little code is needed and how all the boundary cases just work properly.
- Making a menu system
  - I’ve already got one in beldevere
  - I’m afraid to extract it out ... it would be a lot of work!?!
  - Maybe not as much as I think?
- To make a tutorial
  - Show don’t tell
  - Give them an opportunity to learn each mechanic in a safe environment with a safety net where if they mess it up they can easily try again without penalty and then and only then give them the same mechanic without the safety net
