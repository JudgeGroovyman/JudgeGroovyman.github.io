"One of the great leaps in OO is to be able to answer the question “How does this work?” with ”I don’t care”." - Pharo By Example 5

Dont know where to put this: TO figure out what behaviors might be needed for a game engines scripts or nodes or whatever see the Construct 3 docs 'behavior reference'

# Games And Apps #


Levels of Sophistication

1. 1970s - Simple text games, Space Invaders, 
2. Early 1980s - Pinball, Pac Man, Galaga,
3. Mid 1980s - Bards Tale, 
4. Late 1980s Early 1990s - Eotb, 3D Polygon Racing Games, Wolfenstein, Doom

For Some of these engines the showcases they have so far its a stretch to say that they could make mid 80s games.  For others its easy for them to make crappy looking early 90s games but making a good looking game from any era is out of their reach.

## Sorting these Game Engines ##


This is what I want to find and for you to be able to find:
"We make no claim that ______ is the best game engine out there for any game, but we dare to say that ______ is the best game engine for some games."
For the type of game or games you are making: what is the best engine for that?

Each type of game has its own ocean and the different game engines live at different depths of the ocean.
How deep do you have to go to do something with this language? = That HTML 3D language 0 Leagues Puzzlescript 1 League (only 20 Leagues Deep)
How deep can you go and still do things with this language?  Unity Unreal = 20,000 Leagues
Some engines are located at the area near "Hot Reload" Island.  Feature Island.

What is a game engine? [Allegro](https://liballeg.org/index.html) says it "Allegro is not a game engine: you are free to design and structure your program as you like" which makes me think of the game loop and opinionated things like that are what make the difference between a game engine and a multimedia or game library or resource. 
For this reason a game engine could be with or without an IDE or any kind of scene manager.


Prediction: One or two of these engines or libraries will be very old so I will dismiss it, but in fact it will have a thriving non-obviouscommunity who is super happy with its feature complete stable situation and how well it works even on all modern computers, and I will miss out on that one.  Most of the old things are just dead though. 
Favorite Features:

AppGyver
"How can we afford to do this? Why?
We've been around for ten years, and we've always provided free plans for smaller organizations and indie developers while focusing on large enterprises as our paying customers. With Composer Pro, we're just continuing this tradition. We believe that in order to build a global community of visual programmers, everybody needs to have access to the same platform. That's why."







## Lists of Game Engines ##




Classic Engines
---------------
Always wanted to make a game in AMOSPro
Always wanted to make a game in BlitzMax
Always wanted to make a game in PyGame
-----------------------------------
Always wanted to make a game in DarkBasic
Always wanted to make a game in ncurses
Would be so proud to write a Genesis game in SGDK













Incorporate my notes and my saying no tos  below into my spreadsheet somehow or at least have another gander at them.  Some will be truly dead.  Others will be working just fine but not having updates recently
Also incorporate the game based engines below, 
and then on teh creative tab put all of those into the correct format
And then on the tlos and libraries tab put those into the correct format too ... maybe

# GUIs #


Visual tools for developing traditional desktop GUIs


To be fair lots or most of the IDEs and Languages have some level of GUI Builder associated or compatible.  I have mostly only listed the ones which have a sort of official one.  To be fair to the other side of the coin most of the third party or unofficial ones are not great in some way or sparsely supported.  Its kind of like when N64 had four player support built into the system and no one else did, it was the party game console because of it.  Other systems had a few 4+ player games but since you had to buy the extra piece it wasnt supported as well or as widely.  To be fair to those with third party GUI BUilders again, I suspect that for some 10% of the ones I haven't looked into they are really good and supported and even heavily used and Ive missed that.  Let me know if that is the case for your favorite IDE.

## 1. Investigate these for GUIS from code or GUI Builders










## 2. Investigate these newer fancier GUI solutions


- 


## 3. Investigate these No Code development Platforms
If I want to that is ... at least try out the free ones and see what gives


Expensive ones aka RAD aka No Code Development platforms aka low code development platforms

Note: Do any of these hold your app hostage if you dont pay?  Be careful to the terms on that account




- --------------------- Investigate These


# Programming on Mobile #

SmartBasic (my favorite)
Low Res Coder (can use MFI Joysticks!)
- [Fancade](https://www.fancade.com) play thousands of games and create your own


- PlayCanvas - This one is barely advertised to run on mobile but it should work really well and its cloud based so no storage required.

- AppGameKit literally RUNS on mobile.  Huge ding on what could be so great: it doesnt support BT Keyboards at least on IOS
- SmartBasic is my favorite.  It is really cool and can do a lot I spent a long time with it in bed as I fell asleep making cool graphics programs.  Its even got buttons and UI and stuff and its all documented in app.  It can send programs out to email I think so you can get them out of the app and you can always copy and paste them in and there may even be a better way to get them in.  Then you can even make your OWN APP on your phone from this using some kind of shortcut trick. its pretty awesome.  PLUS you can get a smart basic sdk for xcode and publish your iphone apps in the app store!  Thats pretty damn awesome if you ask me.   GPS, Multitouch, Networking, Music and Video, etc.  This is the one app that reminds me the most of AMOS for Amiga.  It says theres dropbox support and a forum to get answers.  thats awesome.  Update: It even works with bluetooth Keyboard!!!  One of the cool things about this and the other AIOs is how consistent everything is that works within the system.  you have to learn new commands and adapt in small ways you dont have to learn entirely new patterns or paradigms and you certainly dont have to add a bunch of boilerplate code.
- Codea 
- Construct 3
- Basic by miSoft - its a cool throwback, people say its best to dropbox your file and copy and paste it in
- Hotpaw basic like Chipmunk basic interpreter on iphone - not recently updated
- A few others on my old ipad

Programming on Mobile by typing in code and uploading it to a server
- Buffereditor
- Textastic
- Koder
- (there are actually a ton more)
- something Ive got on my phone for coding directly on my server
- Code Anywhere
- Anything that can put code on a server or on a 


Investigate: The smart basic SDK for xcode, I wonder if you can program in basic using that and run it on your mac easily?  its probably not interpreted so theres that but thats a pretty cool possible feature.



# Simple Starting Points #
1. AOZ.studio (see my [Amiga Page](Amiga.md) under AMOSPro for more)
2. OLCConsoleGameEngine [The intro video](https://youtu.be/u5BhrA8ED0o) all of the videos surrounding this video on his page use this engine and a windows console application to make games from nothing using just visual studio and this one dependency (well and iostream)  ALso he has a pixelgameengine that he uses later.
3. SmartBasic
4. AutoIT (GUI Builder) or AutoHotKey

# Amiga Programming #


Amiga Programming Options
Allegro 1 (could then port to Allegro 5)
Purebasic
AMOSPro or AmosProDark or X
Blitzbasic

## AMOSPro ##

From the Marc365 page: This repository is 68k Assembly and unique in design. It is powerful and runs like an operating system. Games and multimedia become exciting to program again, relying on your own skills instead of libraries.

Cool Facebook Group
https://www.facebook.com/groups/AmosPro
There you can get info about the latest source, find the AGA version, and ask questions from a supportive community.

Programming the Amiga installing AMOS the easy way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coOdEs4lJZ0
Here he shows how to get AMOS Pro running from the marc365 repo, also from amosforwindows, and then shows how to change startup sequence to fix paths so the amosforwindows can access the disks

Officially maintained Open Source Repo
https://github.com/marc365/AMOS-Professional-365
This is the official repo now for AMOS Pro Sources.  There are instructions on how to rebuild the whole program in the readme and there is an entire built verison in the /AMOS folder. I've had problems with line endings but once I converted line endings it worked.  If everything fails miserably thats probably the problem.  Someone said using the compiler that when the "Open default screen" in the Compiler Options is set to "No" (which is default) then even simple compiled programs crash. 
I hestitate to even mention this but I have heard of animosity between mark365 and other members of the AMOSPro community as of 2018 but I see no evidence of that at this point.
The compiler is here too but I dont think the examples disk is here

AMIDark - Fork with AGA and HAM8 support
https://github.com/AmiDARK/Amos-Professional-AGA-Releases
Here is the binary only AGA release which is hot and regularly updated.  Its also got HAM8 support recently.  Lots of support from the wizard author Frederic Cordier on the facebook group.
Heres the developer diary and official page of this fork http://amos-professional-aga.frederic-cordier.fr/?developer-diary

Offical Francois Lionet Version
This one is getting no maintenance but is forked from MARc365 and has official MIT license information.  This is important because it is from the original author and sets in stone the license terms which were for a time in 2019 in question and causing a huge political problem with the AGA release and any further substantial development.  I would say this will remain important but only for historical reasons.
https://github.com/AOZ-Studio/AMOS-Professional-Official
This is being maintained however as noted at the [top of this page](http://amos-professional-aga.frederic-cordier.fr)

Francois lionet's new project
https://www.aoz.studio
This is an AMOSPro compatible modern language which can then run in the browser which is pretty damn cool imho.  I believe it generates javascript.  It is supposed to retain compatiblity with old AMOS or AMOSPro programs.  Imho it wont be perfect but will be really good and there will be a certain skillset required to know what needs to change from old commands to the new language.  I hope I'm wrong.  certainly there are new superset commands making it easier to load modern graphics and sound resources.


Amos for Windows 2011
Heres an old 2011 version of AMOSPro running in an old pre-configured version of UAE which just boots quickly into AMOSPro.  Thats pretty cool and requires no setup.  If you want to setup an Amiga see Preconfigured Environments below.
http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=60144&fbclid=IwAR17q7fj3e6PhPT-MTU339anBeq1Fqj5uvjlm7U82Qp6JmSsvmFphq_xvks
It has all of the disks included including the examples disk and productivity disks
Also has some patches to get AMOS3D programs working which is unique and cool.  And there are some 3d examples. 
Also has the AMCAF extension which has faster math, adds and speeds up some graphics routines, adds fancy font support, and fixed protracker.

- Aminet/amos
- [AMOS PD CDRom](https://archive.org/details/cdrom-amospdcd) - this is an interesting thing because there are thousands of programs on there, but in my experience virtually none of them work.  I'm sure they work using the right version of amos on the right OS, but I dont have that so it was frustrating to play with them.  OTOH since the source is there, a lot of learning could take place in just reading the source or trying to get them working and changing some things.

Investigate:
How to get 3d extensions (like in 2011 amos for windows), AMCAF, and Easylife working in the open source marc365 and AMIDark versions


1. I installed the marc365 archive and got it running in FSUAE.  It had to be in PAL mode and I used CLassicWB but had to reinstall it for FSUAE, I dont know why but the hdfile from winuae didnt work at all (not a dos disk) but redownloading and then using some new wb3.1 disks (I was only missing storage) and it worked ok but it expected a DH1 so I made a blank DH1. 
2. I had to setup a folder to use to copy source files back and forth
2. Some keys are really different.  I remembered that shift 2 was double quotes somehow (maybe same on C64?) and I remembered that backquote was single quote (for rem)
3. My Amiga note says that f12 brings up the uae menu, help key is pgdn (fn+down)
4. Had to set it to PAL Mode to get the whole screen showing
5. AMOS files are different than source code. You can 'import' an amos source file.
6. I have looked for a while for games with source code that I can just import and run and they work, but I guess thats asking too much since most will have graphics so I really want the .AMOS files
7. Oubliette expected certain fonts to have been installed.  Thats probably important actually.  When I later installed all of the WB3.1 files then it didnt ask about that anymore
8. For the AMOS Pro executable I did Window->LeaveOut so it pops onto the desktop.  Its the only thing on the desktop otehr than the hard drives.
9. For Oubliette once I got the .ADF and put the .AMOS file that I made from the source in the folder with the ADF tehn it got further, but still didnt work.  When I moved 4 libraries over to my LIBS: folder and restarted then it fired up!  I feel like the screen resolution was messed up in some ways.  Some of hte text stomped on other text, but the whole game was like Zelda dungeons and I got pretty far and played for 10-15 min of progress
11. I clicked ont he M key for the 'monitor' and flashed red and said Monitor Not FOund .  I wonder why?
12. Breaking out of AMOS programs seems to be with ctrl-c but not just any control but the actual control key on my keyboard
14. I am having to hit f12 twice in a row pretty often to get mouse focus working correctly back into the FSUAE and AMOS Pro window so it will take right click menu commands.  Only when i switch away from FSUAE of course but pretty often when I do
15. I clicked on WB on the top right and 15yo me says that amiga-a switches back to amos pro. It looks like atm command-a thats overridden by fsuae so I need to go fix that.  as it is it just fills the window with the desktop
22. Often when I quit an AMOS program with ctrl-c the music keeps playing.  I figured out that if you click the help button it seems to stop the music   
25. Improvements to AMOS Pro: 
	1. Open Recent 3-5 files would be a great new menu item.  
	2. make a keyboard shortcut or right click to go to parent instead of right click goign to all devices.  
	3. Would help navigating through deep directory structures like the AMOS PD CD.  
	4. Mouse wheel support in file selector which as is slows down folder navigation dramatically where it could be so much smoother and more modern with a few tweaks.  
	5. When selecting Config/Set Interpreter it cant find the file out of the box.  Dont know why but it says file not found. unfortunately I dont know what file is not found because of the file not found dialog box!  
	6. Option to turn off Shift-Backspace (The bane of my Amiga Existence)
26. I remember something about powerpack.library and had to add that to libs to get something working yesterday
32. I cant figure out how to install an extension so I asked on Facebook.  Maybe someone will be able to help me. Update: They're saying its Config/Set Interpreter but thats just says file not found. unfortunately I dont know what file is not found because of the file not found dialog box.  Screen recording showed that it was AMOSPro_System:Interpreter_Config.AMOS which its true doesnt exist.  
	a. Actually though if I run it from OUTSIDE AMOS it seems to run (like its a compiled program).  This is preferable since with this you can screw up the interpreter by loading the wrong extensions.   this is worthy of suggesting that you backup your config.
	b. Also if I run from 2.00 off of floppy disk then it works ok from there too
	c. If I copy the version of that file from the floppy then it launches properly.
	d. However: No default configuration.  
		it wont let me set the extensions right away, I have to 'load a configuration first' but it wont let me load or set a default configuration :( it will let me load other configuration and then I seem to be able to add extensions but lets make sure. Ok yeah it worked.
	e. Holy shit the sticks extension is hardcore! the unregistered version brings up a huge yellow warning when you launch AMOSPro.  Does it do that every time?  how incredibly annoying!?!  If so I hope theres a full licensed version floating around or hope we can actually 
	f. Well the sticks extension in slot 17 doesn't display its name in the about loaded extensions but maybe thats ok ... I dont know  ... lets see if any of those sticks demos run though ... the sticks one does and its a mess the rest dont.  Forget this. 
37. When firing it up the resolution isnt quite right and you can see parts of the underlying program screen behind and above the AMOS Pro editor, until that is you hit the help button and it fixes itself.
38.  Big problem: At least with the sticks extension installed my cursor keys arent working.  I dont suspect the sticks extension but I havent really tried my cursor keys before this.   what a weird thing to nto work. I can type to edit and all.
	a. Booting from floppy I could use the cursor keys!  I wonder why ... lets go try it on WinUAE brb. From there with the same marc365 build it works too!  Try it with external kb in amospro nope doesnt work .  
	c. Try it in amigaos proper.  Nope So its fsuae somehow  
	b. Try it in a fresh install of marc365.  
	Update: This is because FSUAE is being smart!  If it doesnt have a joystick connected then it overrides the cursor keys to be used as a joystick! Smart!  But I didnt know that so I thought they were broken.  So ... I can turn joystick port emulation off.  Yup I just turned the joystick off of amiga keyboard and the cursor keys started working!
39.  Simplest ways to get AMOS Pro running
	1. Booting directly from the 2.00 floppies.  this isn't the latest open source version which isn't all bad. but booting from floppies is slow and you have to swap disks.
	2. From the marc635 github.  
	3. using the amospdcd WB folders copying those files to a folder and pointing UAE DH0 to that folder.  and putting the marc365 folder in that folder too.  copy the libraries folder from that cd over to libs too
40. to get the disks working you might have to do an assign command.  I did two because I forgot what it was looking for `assign APD002: <actual directory>` and `assign APD2: <actual directory` navigating to the actual directory in amigados wasn't instantaneous and I wonder if theres a way for it to be or for me to construct the commands on the mac in advance?  I also wonder if they will continue to expect those disk names.  Update: In the AMOS file selector you can click on Assigns and select the disks that are assigned from that menu!
41. THi sis my process: hit start in FSUAE, Double click on AMOSPro, Right Command+L x2 then load what I want.  I have been adding the assigns in text edit on the mac before I do any of that.
42.  Its cool that the mouse wheel works in amospro even if it doesnt work in the file inspector
43. For amos pro I set the switch back to amos pro key to be shift left amiga a (it was amiga a but thats used by fsuae so to avoid any issues. .. maybe I should switch it back I dont know.  )   It was hard to switch in page 2 of interpreter config.
44. switched it back so I didnt forget that i switched it (and since with full keyboard on it works just fine)

	
 Software:
 
10. Now I'm looking at the Aminet amos-col.lha and there is some really cool stuff in here including a chaos demo with lots of cool features. One fun thing is I dont know how to quit without themusic still playing!  I dont know how it even has music since its just a source file with no blocks ... maybe its not though maybe the .AMOS has the graphics embedded?  Yeah I think thats right.  Flag works and Interface works but interface is real clunky, like I dont think its working as intended honestly.  I wonder if it worked better in 1.3 on AMOS 1.3?  Scroll works great and is cool when you hit a key.  
	a. 3D_CUBE Simple 3D Cube
	b. Really cool Demo with loads of cool FX
	c. sin wave pixels
	d. scrolling text in front of background image
	e. Starfield
	f. Zooming in and out of an image
16. amosFAME.lha from Aminet
	a. Well the deform picture works but i mean its 1fps or 2fps on 68040.  
	b. Theres a cool pixel square tunnel
17. ADBs_Games_Vol1 
	a. These games worked when I assign Games_Vol1: GV1
	b. Some of the source loaded too
18. mob_city.lha and mob_city_src.lha this is great if you put the source in the same folder as mob city then it runs perfect from inside amos and has 300k of actual AMOS Source code for a point and click adventure game with tons of pixel art cartoony fun pictures.
19. mummy.lha and all of its associated lha files put them all in one folder. and this is a fever dream theoretically targeted at children lol and all with lots of voice sound samples actually which is impressive.
	a. Bangman works great but its sadistic!  Is a super simple game of hangman except when you put a wrong letter it says "Dynamite in the pocketypoos" and then when you are out of letters the kid pushes the lever and the guy gets blown up and screams!
	b. chase is supid kidn of like memory but you dont get to see the answers first	
	c. Choochoo is absurd like operation wolf "Shoot the naughty men and the shoes sweetie cheekie" Huge gameplay issue is the mouse stops when she starts talking!?!  had to run 68020 or there wasnt enough shooting time
	d. Go troll is go fish with weird trolls!
20. sneechsource.lha this one worked great and played great and is one of the best games I've seen on here.  The graphics were awesome too
21. offlineSC is a good example of a text menu.  its for bbs which are offline to explain why they are offline.  I guess it even waits for calls and connects to modems and stuff.  The source runs and its a nice super simple text based menu system which stores your input.  
23. Spot-it copy into the same folder and this is a great game of pixel art see what changed. I beat level 3!  250 pts no misses!
24. necb colouring book works great has cute music and is a great coloruing book for kids of all ages.  Its easy and fun.  Right click pulls up the menu again. I think right click should also go into paint mode so maybe thats something I could make it do?  you can load paintings and save them.  I dont know if you can load any black and white iff and paint it but taht would be pretty cool!  Its funny because it has donald duck coloring pages which people wouldnt get away with now :)
27. AMOSPD178 has a mastermind that doesnt run and a maze game of some kind where you die immediately: Update: if you run autoexec.AMOS then the mastermind runs well!  Theres a funny quirk where if you select information from teh menu to try to figure out the rules it totally resets your progress! haha!
28. Interesting things in the aminet folder on teh AMOSPDCD: Fortunately there is an index of what is in there: Update of AMOS to 1.36.  Found out that the CUAmiga coverdisk from 1991 has 5 extensions and is version 1.35 so it could probably be updated with the aminet file.  Theres some AMOS programs from Amiga Computing 1992, EME is a Protracker and MED extension for AMOS and AMOSPro, another MED Player, several sets of extensions wiht misc features including at least one with screen scrolling features (JDLib although its in German its got lots of examples), a Maze generator, a rainbow maker, a Turbo extension, and a map maker (TAME), and an AGA extension called stars
29. in Authors there are 38 authors with an average of 5-10 sample programs
31. In Catalogue is a joystick reader software which can read from serial joysticks and caln also read 4 button joysticks!  Thats a pretty big deal if you ask me.  Its an extension.  Update: see above for getting it installed.  Its super annoying licenseware extension that shows a click through pop up warning when yous tart and quit amospro.  Super annoying, and also the demo programs work for shit.  
33. in Extensions is Amos_Turbo (Which I also found on ultimate amiga turbo plus), easylife, eme, stars, sticks, JD
34. The music folder on the CD has tons of tracks that I can listen to and presumedly use in my games!
36. Loads of Samples for Trackers in the Samples folder
38. RnD the following sections Authors - PD Disk Library - Aminet - Music - Samples - SourceCode - Sprites - Totally AMOS - 
	a. I slightly tried loading the music but didnt figure it out yet.  Let me look in the manual
42. Loads of [sound samples](https://www.amiga-stuff.com/pd/amospd.html) in the AMOSPD CD
43. Loads of music in the same place.  To play the music the quickest way go to help and music and click on teh example program and from there load a bank.  Some standout tracks: AxelF, Beast, Backpopped (this is one I used to have OMG This takes me back so much!!!!), These were all converted from MODS.  Simpsons, mod4.  Listened to about 1/3 of them and half of them stunk but its cool to have them all available



 Loads of interesting programs with source in the [AMOS PD Library](https://www.amiga-stuff.com/pd/amospd.html) about half way down
*	APD200 Dungeon Master Shell game - wow its really cool!  I wish the enemy would be nicer or I wish you could attack it but at least on a 68040 its really freaking fast and could make a great game!
*	APD245 light cycles (Wow this is super elegant and absolutely tiny like 2 pages of total code omg!), breakout (written in 1hr??? OMG this guy is a genius! and this is only like 4 pages of code), Sprite viewer
*	APD256 SBV Sprite Bank Viewere and a music player.  Super Simple Joystick Tester, Phrase flipper is a fun little speech generation program! omfg Select+wipe is a fucking utility and doesnt bother asking you for confirmation. You're playing other games casually and then load this and then select a random file to see what fun can be had and it just ... deletes it without confirmation LOL I deleted two things because I didnt believe the first one was actually deleted.  Theres a great intro screen left to right starfield here.  s
*	APD258 Glodrick Platform and ladders game.  the controls are way too fast I wonder if they arent frame independent.  Eric is an overhead kind of minesweepeer game.  The art on these is simple pixel art and the sophistication is low but they are complete games and have redeemign qualities like in eric when you blow up it shows you where all of the mines are. THe hangman doesnt run but I like how simple the code is though. 
*	APD281 My Music Machine for making music.  I dont like using this program to make music however the code is super surprisingly simple for what it is. I would have thought it would have been so much more complicated. and I like how he presented the title screen with different color text.  I love that look. and I like how he used AMAL to have messages to the user float down from the top of the screen. Bunny Blast is a stupid but cute in its own way operation wolf duck hunt thing with bunnies
*	APD286 Tron whoa nice! this uses JimPlaysGames Intro music!!! I feel like the timing is a little bit off on the AMOS music all of it like the stuff I listened to that was converted mods yesterday too.  This has some impressive presentation and features and I like how much time this person put into this game.  There are actually four levels to play in, two players and the music fades out softly when its time to play the game.  The in game sound should be turned off or way down its just annoying, but i really like that you can actually redefine the keys IN GAME!  Thats a pretty big feature for a little game like this and impresses me.  The tron logo is really nice graphics. Wow menus are really easy to do in AMOS.  I'm impressed by that too. the way they did keydef is actually really clever.  Brians Theme apparently based on an apple 2 program it draws interesting moire patterns at different resolutions and has a really cool rocking mod track from 'little richard' sounds alittle like rock and roll racing I enjoyed using this a lot and the menu and repeated pattern presentation is super classy.  Also it shows how to make the text cursor different which is a cool classy trick. and its a nice way to make a menu.  Its clear understandable code and actually teh algorithm that does all the work is short!
*	APD295 Music Player (compiled), astrowars is wow amazing! sort of.  As it is its unplayable becuase its just a two player battle where turning and acceleration is vastly too fast but the sprites and the sounds if slowed down and the background would be really fantastic for an asteroids game. #continue
*	APD296 GLOD a simple text adventure.  Its got a great sense of humor actually and im only on the title screen.  What I love about this is how old school basic this is. I'm reasonably sure this could have been done on c64.  I made some real progress but didnt win #continueplaying    Then Pro Grafeti is actually pretty damn cool.  the graphics and painting are surprisingly good.  The code is really well commented.  It lets you save and load your pictures which is bad ass and pixel perfect.  Apparently there are keyboard combinations for colors oh no that code is about clicking in the right zones to use as buttons for changing color.  It could be adapted reasonably easily I guess #continue
*	APD298 Bobalizer music player.  This is a good ABK Music player.   Its got a delete feature.  HOpefully it asks for confirmation?  Why would you want a delete outside of the fiel system? lol!  Nope it doesnt confirm.  WHY WOULD YOU WANT THAT?  I guess because it can be done you should put it in your program.  I'm being too critical and picky its a great program and I'm more criticizing paradigms at the time than anythign else.  Interesting that AMOS songs seem to me to lose some speed, the rhythm just isnt perfect and this is no exception. Backpopped is one that you can really tell.  I just opened it in OctaMED and damn its so much better and clearer in there.  
*	APD316 Cycle Racers, Asteroid Belt, Wheel of Fortune, To really get this running I had to "option 4 -- by harbinder ghag (/Users/johnmcgarey/Documents/FS-UAE/HardDrives)" add that to my DH2 hard drive and of course put the files from the disk in that folder.   This intro for Option4 is really good.  ITs a cool mod with a fantastic graphical font and also a starfield.  Option 4 seems to be a menu system for selecting your game.  	  Wow cycle racers is so fun (for what it is) its a simple multiplayer gambling game betting on races with simple clear interface and great presentation (especially noteworthy is the music and the musical transitions) the race is exciting because of the music but isnt belabored with much time spent.  its great. Asteroid Belt stinks but the high score entry is great and responsive.  Bat and ball is terrible too but with great high score entry and music.  He reused the music applying it cleverly to each game but its good music so thats not bad

*	APD002 has a fun treasure seeking game kind of like battleship but with more clues with voice samples and fun pixel art.  I found the treasure!!! I had fun with this one.  The animation and art was super cute.  It was written by a STOS user (and "New Atari User" author) Peter Hickman and was the first real game to be made in AMOS in January 1990 6 months prior to AMOSs release.  He says lots of the STOS games will work in AMOS as well so read his column in New Atari User Mag

## Pharo ##
Pharo Sep 15 2020
- I dont seem to be able to run Pharo5 which is the version in the book. Can I run 4?  Is it a 32/64bit problem? Nope it looks like all 32bit images dont run on my 64bit mac.  
- Meta Clicking is Shift OPtion and brings up a halo on the clicked window.  I dont know what all these buttons are but the close button is not the right one to remove the halo.
- Click on the background to remove halos
- Click on background or right click to get to the world menu
- Use the PharoByExample book to get started
- Also use the ProfStef go. to get a hands on tutorial.  ProfStef is awesome.  Shes a great encouraging teacher
-  'Pharo6.0 of 13 May 2016' Update 60547 thats the result of SmalltalkImage current datedVersion. but I chose a 6.1 image ... hmm ... Also it thinks its the 13 of May 2016
- When Going through ProfStef at the beginning of an empty line shift and down arrow selects the whole line.  Shift down down, then cmd p, then backspace, then shift down down to do thenext line.

Command notes:
- single quote for strings, comma to separate $for character.
- single quote string size asUppercase reverse at: 1
- factorial, maxval, asFloat, class, 
- Character allByteCharacters
- (Smalltalk globals at: #ProfStef)
- #(1 2 3) is a literal array.  size.  isEmpty. first.
- in an array at: 2 put: 3; yourself
- Date today + 3 weeks.  Date today < Date yesterday.
- 4 between: 0 and: 10.
- Color: r:1 g:0 b:0
- (0@0 corner: 100@200) class.
- -3 abs negated recriprocal;

I'm on lesson 16/29 and I'm a bit burned out.  Gonna go get a bath I think.

# Assembly #

Super Low Level Awesomeness
* [NandToTetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project01) has a book and a coursera plus a load of free materials on the site (is the ebook on the site? I'm not sure ... it kind of looks like it is)
* [Ben Eater](https://eater.net)
* [Emulating A CPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJgsuQoy9bc&list=PLLwK93hM93Z13TRzPx9JqTIn33feefl37)

* [6502 Assembly](http://www.obelisk.me.uk/6502/) 
* [Hack Machine Language](https://github.com/aalhour/Assembler.hack)

## Assembly onModern Mac ##
This is actually pretty tricky to do assembly on modern systems unless you really know what you're doing.  

* I got a hello world going from [James Fishers tutorial](
https://jameshfisher.com/2017/02/20/macos-assembly-hello-world/) but then I saw this [nasm tutorial](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/) and was intrigued by the slight differences in the hello world code.  
* I think you could get a lot of information from these commands and operands lower down a bit in [this nasm tutorial](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/) it focuses on the details of the hardware and the most basic assembly commands and also has some mac specific details and a mac specific averaging program at the bottom that takes input and makes output.
* I heard earlier today that really assembly is about the details of the hardware as much as the language.  
* Samuel Evans-Powell figured out some things about [learning NASM on macOS](http://sevanspowell.net/posts/learning-nasm-on-macos.html) like about syscalls and the differences on mac and linux and also in that article he talks about linking c and assembly, and he talks about not absolute addressing on mac osx, and also about padding the stack frame.  It suggests using gcc to link instead of ld which lets you use the c standard library.  
* Here is a [Brainfuck Interpreter](https://www.kylem.net/programming/bf_interp.html) in x86-64 assembly
* Here are some 8086 programs that I can probably get running like I did with nasm on the mac above or with the boot sector approach

### Linking with a C Library ###
I wanted a super simple C Library so I'm going to [write one myself](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-make-your-own-libraries-in-C-programming).  I got it working and was able to call a super simple C library that I made (that just printfs the input number) from assembly.  It sends a number as a parameter but I dont understand the assembly enough yet to decide how to tell it to send an integer.  I got it sending a string (char *) through to the C code though and it worked great!


## Assembly on Modern Linux ##
* This [nasm tutorial](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/) seems really good and also has some mac and win specifics but is mostly linux specific.
* Running 

# Bare Metal #
* This guy [runs some programs on bare metal](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22054578/how-to-run-a-program-without-an-operating-system/32483545#32483545)


# C #
* [Freestanding C programs](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/01/31/) on windows.  this guy wrote some C programs for windows on linux with no external libraries or dependencies except operating System DLLs.  He also wrote some opengl style programs in tiny sizes for DOS (and he wrote those in linux too)

1. [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/examples.html) (Straightforward C and OpenGL library with tons of language bindings and lots of capability)

# Makefiles #
[Super simple makefile](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/08/26/makefile-c-projects/)

# Folder Organization #
[Folder Structure by Infallible Code](https://youtu.be/F89PWIk7zec?t=328) It makes sense to keep scripts in scripts folder and textures in textures folder, but it also makes sense to organize conceptually or by object.  Searching lets you find things by name or type easily, but "You can't search by conceptual feature" like the laser dragon boss.  Plus things are often removed or replaced conceptually and delete a folder rather than finding things spread all over your product.  You can use tags too for categories and thats worth doing. 


# Flow charts flowcharts #

This is a language called [Flowgorithm](http://www.flowgorithm.org/download/index.htm) that lets you use simple pseudocode to plot out how your software or algorithms will work

There was something online I think called diagrammr where you would just type simple words on the right and it would make diagrams out of them

Free
yEd Live is free online and works great
Google Drawings is totally free
Draw.io is free
diagrameditor.com works for free

LOVE yEd is free downloadable for win mac lin - The usability is through the roof here even with touchpad.  Scrolling is clunky for some reason, and other parts of the GUI are clumsy.
Pencil is a free downloadable for making GUI Mockups and Diagrams

yUML - this one you just type on the left and it makes a diagram
DrawAnywhere
Sketchboard is free for public projects
This is code for making executable flowcharts with a free editor online

All of these have limited free plans
Cacoo
Gliffy
Creately has a good free plan
Canva



This cool software lets you make diagrams by typing reasonably simple commands its for programmers andit looks pretty great BUT Its $15/mo if you wan to use any of the powerful features or make too big of a diagram.  Still worth checking out

# BASIC #
See my [Amiga Page](Amiga.md) for lots of BASIC

- [Learn BASIC Online](http://www.runbasic.com/seaside/go/runbasic?_s=zmRffWJWpHSEWXSS&_k=zCNyUHwT) with RUNBasic by Libertybasic.  

Learn basic programming by example a 2d game pt 1 is a great intro to purebasic making a game and by 11:20 he has a lot of the boilerplate out of the way so just that one page of code is a great starting point

## Chipmunk Basic ##
- Chipmunk Basic 9/15/2020 for mac is a simple basic interpreter.  It doesnt work like an IDE or a text editor but it works like having a commodore 64 or apple II in this window.  You can load basic programs which dont require line numbers with load "filename" but they have to be in your documents folder for some reason or you can specify the path directly.  A little softlink fixes that problem.  This is so great! It took me right back in time and let me play a game I typed in a few years ago ACEYDUCEY from the book 101 BASIC Computer games.  I think I typed it in anway ... 
9/15/2020 Ive had fun with it.  Its a great way to learn how things used to work back in the day.  I bought a bt mechanical keyboard so I could type some of these old programs in.
ACEY DUCEY from 1010 Basic Computer Games works perfectly as downloaded.  I wonder if the others do too?

# LUA #

Heres a way to compile lua into a GUI executable.  You can even possibly make it self modify its own code!

# Game Jams #

Tips:

1. Use Git the easy way to back up every time you make a mistake
2. Use Unity Folder Profiles to always import your sprites with certain settings
3. Show how to really do a good job of wrapping up your Unity game for Ludum Dare
	1. How to compress the source
	2. How to send the git repo along with the game
	3. Delete some of the extra stuff from the folder to lower the size
	4. Easiest ways to put HTML5 version on 
	5. How to get decent screenshots
	6. How to make a decent cover photo
	7. How to resize and optimize photos so they dont take forever (slows the page and statically people dont like that)
		8. A short gif makes a HUGE difference in how the game comes off to potential players.
	9. How much time the wrapping up takes relative to the game itself when youve never done it
		10. And how almost no one will be 'done' with their game and get through the process of shipping without having to make changes.
		11. and even if they do how thats probbaly just good luck or lots of experience.
	12. How to name your different builds Name_Mac_1.1.
		14. Go with 1.1 1.2 1.3 theres no reason to expect that you will get up to 1.9 during the jam and if you do then you can go to 2.0 or you can go to 1.91 (super unlikely) so for simplicitys sake even for tiny 1 line fixes go with 1.1 1.2 1.3
4. Show

# Github #
Tips on making a great github repo:

1. Link to a sales page in the top right
	That page should have an introduction page, a features list (with lists but also lots of pictures), documentation, and a community page at minimum
2. Download badges at the top of the description [like at pge project](https://github.com/WohlSoft/PGE-Project)
3. License


# People #
1. Gentoogames - this guy is a master of clean isometric like pixel art and the workflow of the art and animation into gamemaker.  HIs workflow is buttery smooth.


# Putting Games Live #

1. [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/432177775)
2. [GameJolt](http://gamejolt.com)
3. [Itch.io](http://itch.io)
4. [Simmer.io](https://simmer.io/@Franion/stuckinaneonloop) possibly the best in some ways (esp for game jams) since you can just drag and drop from Unity.  weird it doesnt seem to work in safari on mac .. maybe its just that game I dont know.
