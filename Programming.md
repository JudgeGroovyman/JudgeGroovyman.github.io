"One of the great leaps in OO is to be able to answer the question “How does this work?” with ”I don’t care”." - Pharo By Example 5

Dont know where to put this: TO figure out what behaviors might be needed for a game engines scripts or nodes or whatever see the Construct 3 docs 'behavior reference'

# Games And Apps #


Levels of Sophistication

1. 1970s - Simple text games, Space Invaders, 
2. Early 1980s - Pinball, Pac Man, Galaga,
3. Mid 1980s - Bards Tale, 
4. Late 1980s Early 1990s - Eotb, 3D Polygon Racing Games, Wolfenstein, Doom

For Some of these engines the showcases they have so far its a stretch to say that they could make mid 80s games.  For others its easy for them to make crappy looking early 90s games but making a good looking game from any era is out of their reach.

# Interesting Programming Options 2020 #

## Sorting these Game Engines ##

This is what I want to find and for you to be able to find:
"We make no claim that ______ is the best game engine out there for any game, but we dare to say that ______ is the best game engine for some games."
For the type of game or games you are making: what is the best engine for that?

Each type of game has its own ocean and the different game engines live at different depths of the ocean.
How deep do you have to go to do something with this language? = That HTML 3D language 0 Leagues Puzzlescript 1 League (only 20 Leagues Deep)
How deep can you go and still do things with this language?  Unity Unreal = 20,000 Leagues
Some engines are located at the area near "Hot Reload" Island.  Feature Island.

What is a game engine? [Allegro](https://liballeg.org/index.html) says it "Allegro is not a game engine: you are free to design and structure your program as you like" which makes me think of the game loop and opinionated things like that are what make the difference between a game engine and a multimedia or game library or resource. 
For this reason a game engine could be with or without an IDE or any kind of scene manager.


Prediction: One or two of these engines or libraries will be very old so I will dismiss it, but in fact it will have a thriving non-obviouscommunity who is super happy with its feature complete stable situation and how well it works even on all modern computers, and I will miss out on that one.  Most of the old things are just dead though. 
Favorite Features:

AppGyver
"How can we afford to do this? Why?
We've been around for ten years, and we've always provided free plans for smaller organizations and indie developers while focusing on large enterprises as our paying customers. With Composer Pro, we're just continuing this tradition. We believe that in order to build a global community of visual programmers, everybody needs to have access to the same platform. That's why."

I like the idea of getting some set of several simple apps working in C/C++/C# or Java and maybe a simple SDL and an OpenGL game and maybe a GUI App or two in all of the following IDEs:
XCode
Visual Studio
NetBeans
Eclipse
IntelliJ IDEA
And then the same apps in these more interesting ones:
Cevelop (C++ IDE with TDD and other great features based on Eclipse)
VSCodium (VSCode low baggage)
JGrasp
Code:Blocks
CodeLite
PyCharm
Ryder for C#
Komodo (with Tkinter)

Ultra Modern GUIs
-----------------
Eventually would like to make some apps in modern GUI libraries like JUCE below or those others

Classic Engines
---------------
Always wanted to make a game in AMOSPro
Always wanted to make a game in BlitzMax
Always wanted to make a game in PyGame
-----------------------------------
Always wanted to make a game in DarkBasic
Always wanted to make a game in ncurses
Would be so proud to write a Genesis game in SGDK






Notably Slow Websites:
---------------------
Some of these have lightning fast websites which makes a big impression on me.  Others are quite slows










Incorporate my notes and my saying no tos  below into my spreadsheet somehow or at least have another gander at them.  Some will be truly dead.  Others will be working just fine but not having updates recently
Also incorporate the game based engines below, 
and then on teh creative tab put all of those into the correct format
And then on the tlos and libraries tab put those into the correct format too ... maybe

Name, 	    Lanugage, Platforms,   Developer,  	  Community	Install	Access,	Cost,	Notes
				                 Activity    Activity  Size	Ease	    -ability,			

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- GameEditor,	C,		Win Mac,		6,		3,		1,	5,		8,		0,		This C is intriguing. Constraints are nice. 2013 last update
- RapidQ,		BASIC,	Win Lin,		2,		2,		2,	7,		9,		0,		
- Multimedia Fusion - Replaced by Clickteam Fusion
- ScriptBasic Cool because you could run it lightning fast on a certain web server without CGI overhead.  That is a really clever idea.  2010 update :( You know whats cute? Their tutorials are all in real audio format!  Its fast and has tons of features
- HBasic GPL and linux with forms for GUIs and using KDE Libraries.  Looks good
- Turbulenz, Looks polished and promising but theres no activity for 5 yrs
- Blender Game Engine
- pylove Dead
- Blitz3D, 	BASIC,	Win,			0,		1,		1,	9,		6,		0,		I've always thought this would be really cool
- AxisGFactory,Drag,	Win Mac Lin,	3,		2,		1,		Just for Terrains
- Power Game Factory.  This looks great ... the testimonials are glowing ... but it looks ancient too.   Nope it died in 2012 when Lion came out breaking their software :(  I'm honestly surprised I didnt know about this back then. I would have probably loved it, mac, 2d game creation, right up my alley tbh.  
- Tululoo Game Maker dead.  2013.
- [Scroller](http://percsich.hu/sgc/) Scroller Game Creator, download and add triggers and sprites and make a game really easily.  Broken no undo feature as of 2015.
- Axis Game Factory (Dead), $20 ($10 on steam) - Really a level design tool not a whole game engine.  Voxel Sculpt is $30 AGFProPremium is $80 and allows Multiplayer 8 player Simultaneous Design! Its a DLC on top of the $20 Rapid Level Development Toolset, website looks crappy, engine looks cool enough.  Its got a DLC called VoxelSculpt which looks fucking amazing!  I like how it lets you place start and end points for each level and also lets you add story elements.  Collaborate with Friends somehow (maybe just send them a .exe?).  Watching the prmotional video it looks a little clumsy and like coppercube in the sense that the features probably work but they also require that you do things a certain way and its a bit non standard and clunky for example I have no idea what their packaging exe feature was since distributing your software as an exe shouldnt really be a feature but totally a given.  OH!  its designed to work in concert with Unity.  "provide game developers and enthusiasts with a powerful and rapid level creation, terrain vegetation editing, lighting and atmosphere system."  Its got some cool DLC players like a first person shooter and a fantasy side scroller.  The DLC is cheaper on steam than on their website, but its all from 2013-2015 and the website implies that it takes some monkeying to get things working.  I can't imagine that the mac or linux versions even run.
- [Silent Walk FPS Creator](http://www.silentworks.hu/sw/editor.php) Maybe not technically dead still not appealing.  A doom or wolf editor would be better.  
- [Silent Walk Renaissance](http://www.silentworks.hu/swr/features.php) requires xp or 7 so its pretty ancient.    I suspect it was cool what they pulled off at the time though,  
- [Megakerma Maker](http://www.silentworks.hu/mk/features.php) a whole game engine by the same people.  Sort of amazing there was a small team in hungary doing this but its xp so ancient. 
- [Maratis](http://www.maratis3d.org/?page_id=57) died in 2013
- [Platinum Arts Sandbox](https://www.sandboxgamemaker.com/make-a-game-sandbox-faq/) Author still around but project is discontinued
- [Game Builder by Google](https://github.com/googlearchive/gamebuilder) looks like an experimental teaching tool with absolutely zero traction
- Mokoi - Dead in 2015.  Was probably great
- Reality Factory - Dead in 2015
- [Flixel](http://flixel.org/help.html) - This is powerful with lots of games made for it (Canabalt and the best of flash games from 2009 or so), however since its flash its just too old, there are apparently some other projects built on top of it that might be good.  Its got some unique features like moving thousands of objects and also debugging, and recording and replaying information (which is totally bad ass).  Tilemaps, Particles, Physics collisions.  Good thing I saw some little comment on slant that there are also ports, C# is dead, C is dead, Monkey X is dead, HaxeFlixel is ALIVE and Kicking!!
- Polycode (details in spreadsheet)
- Loom SDK (Purchased and dead in 2017)
- GDevApp (Site Gone)
- Crafty.js - Github not updated since 2018.  Forums still talking every few months.
- Haxepunk - last release 2018, they have touched it since but theres no momentum or community
- Spritekit - probably not actually dead but being an Apple product this is very different. Its not the same evaluation as the rest, nor would I believe for a second that it will be more accessible.  Obviously not cross platform either.  OTOH its probably fine for some since it might be the most battery efficient way to make an ios app.
- Flat Red Ball - Activity not actually dead, and there is a small discord so its def not dead, but the website doesn't funnel me in so I dont know why I would pick it in fact it seems based on old stuff and it seems confusing.  There are some demos and tuts on there though so its not terrible and I have nothing against it, but its not fresh enough for me.
- [Chiliworks](https://github.com/ChilliWorks/ChilliSource) its MIT and rumored to be mature but hasnt been touched in 3-4 years and the site is down
- [EasyRPG](https://easyrpg.org) Aiming for the RPGMaker 2000/2003 set of features theyre not close on the maker side.  Probably it will play those old games though. 
- [Fife](http://www.fifengine.net)	C++ Python			Late 90s PC games	Some work in Github	Forum dead  No community unfortunately
- Flare is a diablo engine dead since 2018
- [Fluxus](http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/documentation/) is an interesting livecoding video and audio language from 2010 where you run streams into it and they come out with AR on them.  Its too old and dead to use and too complicated to build, but I like where they are going and the pdf docs from 2010 have description of how really cool it was to use.
- HaxePunk	Haxe	Win Mac Lin	Win Lin Mac HTML5 iOS Android	Amiga Level games with a bit of 90s effects	Not too active on github, a few updates every 6 months or so.	Forum not hopping, Gitter over 1yr old chat, Discord points to the haxe one	Install Instructions seem out of date, 6 demos, 1 tutorial	Tilemaps particles mask collision, Tweens debug console	Free	1	Too Dead					
- Polycode	Lua C++	Win Mac Lin	Win Mac Lin	Dreamcast Looking Games	Bummer.  Nothing since 2015	None on the site	IDE uses Lua	Scenes, Lua for game logic, Materials, Shaders, Meshes, Skeletal Animation, Gamepads, Networking, In Game GUIs, 2D and 3D Collision & Physics	Free	1						
- Alice	http://www.alice.org/get-alice/#why	2	Make 3D Worlds c. 1999, Teach analytical programming thinking. Not for Production	Site unclear, Software Fresh, Forum Alive but slow, Lots of youtube 
- [Heritage](https://notabug.org/SylvieLorxu/HERITAGE) Text Adventure language, 2015 old, but I actually love the syntax.  Too bad.
- Inform - totally mature, heavily used, Problem: this is something people dont really talk about: There isn't anywhere to learn about this.  Nothing really works like you would expect it to work as a programmer so I bet it would be easier to use inform6 or tads, or for a non programmer to learn inform, I love the toolset and the ideas behind it, but if I want to make a relatively simple game I cant do it because there is so much that doesnt make sense and there are no examples.  The ones that are out there are either too complex or dont wokr anymore (thats common).  I'm probalby complaining too much but it has so much potential and has really pissed me off and made me feel stupid and frustrated.  Its really easy to read fortunately and makes for some beautiful code. a lso the maintainers care a lot about it.  I wonder what would happen if I tried again.
- Irrlicht - An old 2012 3d graphics engine that looks great and has lots of features and is mature but doesnt seem maintained.  I heard a lot about this in the past and thought about using it back in the 2000s.

- [Jabaco](https://www.jabaco.org/board/) not 100% dead since theres a post on the forum from this year, but its a really cool idea: Visual Basic with GUIs in the JVM. Its very old so it probably wont work anymore though.  It looks really nice and the GUIS look really good
- [PowerBasic](https://www.powerbasic.com/Which-compiler) Windows only Several hundred for a basic compiler with drag and drop GUI BUilder, macros, debugger, Debugging, make your own DLLs, The forums are quite active.  
- [SDLBasic](http://www.sdlbasic.altervista.org/main/) Big mess of a website but could be a cool implementation.  Forums are active. 
- [TrueBasic](http://www.truebasic.com/) Forums are alive, website is c2020, software is not free. Windows only. Site is sparse.  Pay with paypal or check, but I cant even see how much.
- [wxBasic](https://www.wxbasic.net/home) perfect for making quick GUIs with basic and wxwidgets.		BASIC,	Win Mac Lin,	website is too basic theres no github, no forums, no community, but the software looks SO COOL. site is c2020  It could be worth trying to download and get running but theres no support.  Update; no its dead on mac and wont run.  Says needs an update.
- [SGe](https://python-sge.github.io/download.html) No because there is no community unfortunately.  The website has no mention of community at all.  Its got GUI LIghting Particles Physics tiles and was updated just a few days ago!
- [OpenSludge](https://opensludge.github.io) Adventure Game language and kit but not updated in 2yrs even with a long history.  Also unfortunately their old forums shut down which is a great sad loss of information :( )  Looks like space quest with tons of graphics and art.  Pretty awesome!  Pity because it looks like it had some real momentum.  Now theres no community
- [Chipmunk](https://chipmunk-physics.net/aboutChipmunk.php) this one is sad.  The forum and updates are dead since 2019 but this has a lot of background and was probably some of the fastest tech in the world.  Its on github so its not dead forever but atm no community at all.  it says hundreds of shippign games and has benchmarks to show its speed.

- [UGUI](https://ugui.io) - Quickly add a GUI to a command line program - Dead since 2018 - Says its got the "Best Documented Source Code In Existance" and this is an amazing idea honestly for making a GUI for a command line program.

# GUIs #


Visual tools for developing traditional desktop GUIs


To be fair lots or most of the IDEs and Languages have some level of GUI Builder associated or compatible.  I have mostly only listed the ones which have a sort of official one.  To be fair to the other side of the coin most of the third party or unofficial ones are not great in some way or sparsely supported.  Its kind of like when N64 had four player support built into the system and no one else did, it was the party game console because of it.  Other systems had a few 4+ player games but since you had to buy the extra piece it wasnt supported as well or as widely.  To be fair to those with third party GUI BUilders again, I suspect that for some 10% of the ones I haven't looked into they are really good and supported and even heavily used and Ive missed that.  Let me know if that is the case for your favorite IDE.

## 1. Investigate these for GUIS from code or GUI Builders


 GUI Builders that I have a good feeling about
- [NetBeans and Scene Builder for JavaSwing and or JavaFX](https://netbeans.org/features/) GUI Builder is said to be super fast and intuitive.  you can prototype GUIs live in front of your customers.
- [Glade GTK with Python](https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/builder.html) comes from docs updated just a few days ago so it looks legit.
- [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter) Free license until you make $5000 then its $1000 
- [C++Builder Community](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder/starter) Free license until you make $5000 then its $1000 
- [GTK with Stetic C#](https://www.monodevelop.com/documentation/stetic-gui-designer/) All built into the cross platform Monodevelop.  Should be easy to get and install.
- [IntelliJ with Java](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html) Free Community Edition free to use for any project.  Ultimate has way more language and tool support plus profiling and UML Diagramming.   Ultimate for Individuals: $15/mo or $149firstyear or $25/mo or $249firstyear for all Jetbrains products. Less for renewal each year.  Individual as long as your company doesnt pay for it or reimburse you in any way then you can use it for commercial purposes.  Otherwise for business: $50/mo (or 64 for all) or 499/649/year.  Less for renewal each year.  Free Ultimate Education license with ID proof or for open source projects.
- [wxSmith in Code:Blocks](http://wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php/WxSmith_tutorials)	Cpp	Code:Blocks	Desktop	RAD
- [BuilderX](https://builderx.io/pricing) App builder for Nativebase.io or React Native. 30 day free trial then 15/mo.  Apps made during free trial not accessible
- Python with [wxPython](https://www.wxpython.org) and [wxGlade](https://github.com/wxGlade/wxGlade)
- [FLTK and FLUID with C++](https://www.fltk.org/doc-1.3/fluid.html) Lightweight and old school so it kind of requires lots of code and in fact may prove impossible to compile and get it all running right (Dependency hell) and I dont like that aspect, but I love the philosophy and history and documentation here

 GUI Builders that I dont have a good feeling about - Lots of Unofficial GUI Builder Options (or partially supported high baggage complexity) (I suspect that I will miss out on a few of these being a beautiful perfect marriage. I will miss out because most of these are a hot mess of extra baggage and unsupported complexities)
- [ReactStudio](https://reactstudio.com) Free downloadable app builder for react ... looks awesome ... whats the catch.  2018 copyright on the website.
- [Deco](https://www.decoide.org/may-2016-update) Free downloadable ide for react ... looks awesom ... whats the catch?  2018 copyright on the website.  2016 code in github
- XCode with SwiftUI (not Cross Platform) - Need to try this anyway though
- Visual Studio with C# or VB.net Probably the best in some ways but I dont have a good feeling about it.  Xamarin apparently works OTOH Visual Studio isnt free for everything you want to do.  $45/mo or $1200 for the first year and 799 afterwards.  Baggage seems extremely high although tutorials and community would also be abundant.  - Need to try this anyway though
- Glade/GTK  Claims it can be used with Java C++ Python Rust Perl and cross platform but I have my doubts.
- [Freebasic with Glade/GTK](http://www.siebke.com/freebasic/howto_glade_freebasic.pdf)
- Different than everything else
- [GTKServer](http://www.gtk-server.org/intro.html) This lets you use GTK as a stream from any programming language
- Eclipse with Window Builder for Java GUI Builder
- [CEGUI](http://cegui.org.uk/features) with CEED (Nice GUI and gui builder by same people)(old) 35k posts on the forum. Hard to build
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) especially with bitdev


 GUIs from Simple Code that I have a good feeling about
- [Python with Guietta](https://guietta.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) holy crap this is the simplest way to ever make a gui ever in the history of ever.  Recent updates, doesnt look like theres much of a community though.
- [Python with DearPyGUI](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui#some-features) based on DearImGUI
- [AmberJS](https://amber-lang.net) Smalltalk for web apps "Amber includes a live development environment" debugger test runner. compiles to js  MIT License thousands of commits as recent as 3 months ago
- [Azul](https://azul.rs) hardware accelerated Immediate Mode GUI system for desktop with hot reload.
- [IUP](https://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/) - super simple library C, LUA, only Win and Lin
- [Eclipse with SWT](https://www.eclipse.org/swt/) Latest Eclipse with this cross platform built in toolkit sounds great to me!
- [fpgui for Freepascal](https://github.com/graemeg/fpgui/) is old (Update nope its updated a few months ago) but super lightweight and multiplatform
- [Nuklear](https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear) - IM Mode Library in one file real easy to use in C or C++     I like this very much that it is just one file with no dependencies.  Thats great.  It says it doesnt deal with inputs at all so I would have to
- [JUCE](https://juce.com) for really interesting UIs (particularly for music) - Free



 GUIs from Web Code that I have a good feeling about
- [Muon](https://github.com/ImVexed/muon) GPU GUIs with GO (or maybe js) in tiny amount of code - this seems so damn cool. Electron alternative
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) Free and Open Source Hot Reload GUI looks amazing!  Competes with React Native
- [Python with PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI) Best open source documentation ever.  Wraps up other guis nice and neat and pythonic.  Updated just 1h ago.
- [Revery](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery) another electron alternative hot reload not in yet but this one uses Reason which looks like a super attractive language to me
- [Nativebase.io](https://nativebase.io) React Native Starter Kit open source possible used with [bit](https://github.com/teambit/bit) to collect and store components and put them back in my projects.  Theres a [cloud solution with 36,000 open source components](https://bit.dev) called Bitdev.
- [Graffiti](http://tomsik.cz/graffiti/) Super simple GPU GUI with Hot Reload in tiny amounts of code. lightweight simple electron
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) - If you can build a website you can build a desktop app.  Twitch WhatsApp VSCode all built in electron - uses lots of resources tho


 GUIs from code that I have a good feeling about but theres probably quite a bit of code and some dependency stuff to contend with
- [Python with Atlas](https://github.com/epeios-q37/atlas-python) this looks like a 10 with tons of support
- [FLTK with C++](https://www.fltk.org/doc-1.3/intro.html) win mac lin
- [Nana](http://nanapro.org/en-us/) Win Lin only C++ very clear hello world on front page.  Updated Recently
- [GTK with Python](https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) comes from docs updated just a few days ago so it looks legit.  Probably baggage is relatively high though
- [FOX Toolkit](http://www.fox-toolkit.org) is lightweight and modern, doesnt run on mac but looks unique and apparently runs very fast.  Updated contstantly
- [AGAR](https://libagar.org) cross platform and claims to be easy to get into (I have my doubts)
- [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/) - Cross platform dotnet based XML GUI system - Nice tutorial makes it pretty easy to start, otoh it looks way too wordy and complicated to me personally - recently updated
- [UNO](https://platform.uno) - Pixel perfect multi platform (including web assembly) C# development UI Library.  This looks totally awesome and polished and well supported
- [Sciter](https://sciter.com) - Embeddable HTML/CSS/script engine for modern UI Development
- [DearImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) (with a game engine or SDL or Conan) (tutorials lacking, community can be shitty, there is a discord and github forum, the apparent simplicity of the code is appealing, the wild west nature of the environment gives me the runs)


 GUIs from code that I dont have a good feeling about - some are unofficial "shoehorn" combinations
- [Freebasic with Simple WinAPI GUI Library](https://www.freebasic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=24617)
- [Freebasic with FLTK](https://www.freebasic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=24547)
- [Freebasic with Firefly](https://www.planetsquires.com/protect/forum/index.php?topic=3643.0)
- [Python with TkInter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) this is the only one with official support so there will be lots of tutorials and problem solving but it just seems to old to be low baggage.
- Lots of options with [CEF](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/Home) - Chromium Embedded Framework its about making your web app into a desktop app or something




## 2. Investigate these newer fancier GUI solutions




- 
- 


## 3. Investigate these No Code development Platforms
If I want to that is ... at least try out the free ones and see what gives


Expensive ones aka RAD aka No Code Development platforms aka low code development platforms

Note: Do any of these hold your app hostage if you dont pay?  Be careful to the terms on that account

- ----- Most attractive free plans (see below)
- Outsystems
- Appgyver
- Felgo
- DraftBit
- CrossUI
- AppSheet
- Inboldsolutions
- UIBakery
- Webflow
- Infinible
- Wappler

- ----- Pay to let you develop------------
- [CrossUI](https://www.crossui.com/RAD/) (free for individual to use for non profit otherwise $1000 one time) (this looks like some of the most legit SOFTWARE on the list - more like the IDEs Ive listed above)  its totally free for non profit individual use, and looks like it can export to any desktop or web app or mobile ... but do they mean ios app store with iap?  License bound to a computer.  Demo fast loading and free - they have student discounts and academic institutions.  They will delete projects in online app builder demo thing from time to time.  - Update: it says desktop version is [totally free for individual non profit use](https://www.crossui.com/download.html).  Or you can use [this online one](https://www.crossui.com/RADGithub/) for free but the app requires the ability to delete any of your repos to which you have admin rights.  HELLS NO!  Maybe a new account for this would be best or just use the desktop.   So as expensive as that is, if it lives up to its promises that could be a reasonable.
- [Wappler](https://wappler.io/pricing/) for making websites quickly (0 $20-40/mo for individuals 30/60 for business 10/20 for students) - 7 day trial.  Downloadable app builder software.  this one rumor has it you own the code somewhat which is different with Bubble.  Apps keep working after your license to use the software expires.

- ----- Other Payment plans
- [ReactAppBuilder](https://reactappbuilder.com/#pricing) $140 one time for Self Hosting of the app builder (suspicion that they wont be too motivated to help you get it up and running properly "Oh!  Thats been fixed and is definitely working on our $49/mo plan".
- [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com) is apparently a major player here (see [Outsystems](https://www.outsystems.com) comparison chart)  Kind of like Zoho they do everything for your business.  I dont understand what I'm looknig at here though.  
- ----- Charged per month to build the app or host the app
- [Bubble.io](https://bubble.io) (Free for bubble branded app, $25/mo for whitelabel, $115-475 for more server capacity and development versions of your app) also   [Zeroqode](https://zeroqode.com/faqs) ($100-300/app template - choose from 113 templates - $25-35 features to drop into Bubble.io)  they actually have a [gallery of apps](https://gallery.zeroqode.com) that have been made     [openbuild.io](https://www.openbuild.io/) (0,20,50/mo) UI Library for Bubble.  Make little apps for bubble with custom UI themes.  Do you have to pay just to get access to them and then you can use them in bubble forever or do you have to keep paying to keep using them?
- [AppGyver](https://www.appgyver.com) BEST By Far. "You will never go back to coding" Free for life (Only until $10,000,000 though.  when you hit that you have to pay.)
- [Felgo App Builder](https://felgo.com/pricing) Free Forever commercial publish to desktop and mobile with monetization if lt$50k.  If lt$100k then 948/yr/dev and can also publish to web.  I dont know if you can keep your apps if you get a $948 plan and then go back to free.
- [DraftBit](https://draftbit.com/why) Free during beta period.  No idea how much after or if I can continue to use the app I develop.  Still it looks like a great app builder and seems worth a shot
- [Webflow](https://webflow.com) (0,12,16,35,29,74,212/mo/site) I like this one.  free to use for as long as it takes to prepare.  12/16/35/mo to make your site go live.   Cant export your code unless you pay $16.   For an ecommerce site which takes payments and everything: 29/74/212/mo.  Also there are probably 50,000 Forum Posts so youre not alone.  This is a great site or app builder with a totally fair pricing scheme imho.
- [UIBakery](https://uibakery.io) (0,16,33,67/mo) I like this one. Free to make 1 app and host it on their domain with unlimited pages for as long as you want and work on it all you want and connect it to your database.  Thats pretty cool.  Then to get it on your own domain you pay reasonable amounts above.  Angular Based and this is for making what they call 'web apps' "Like Webflow but for web apps" [Comparison with Bubble and others](https://uibakery.io/bubble-alternatives)
- [Infinible](https://infinable.io/pricing/) (free,20,50,100/mo/app) only for web, Free has built with infinible branding and limited space or bandwidth.   you can create MIT code plugins, not desktop or mobile
- [Inboldsolutions](https://www.inboldsolutions.com/pricing.html) (0/12/25/mo) Make any type of web app for free, no workflow, pivot table, or email sending.  claim that you can make an invoice for free with their app and they have a payment service.    
- [Appery.io](https://appery.io/pricing/) (0/25/99/200/600/mo) Free trial for only 2 weeks.   more money buys more api calls and features and dev seats. 
- [Configure.it](https://www.configure.it/pricing/) (0,9,49,79,199/mo/1project) or 799 once.    30 day free trial.  No cc required (lots of them dont require cc).  after 30 days if you dont pay they delete your app after 60 more days.  I think thats lame otoh most of these companies are doing this.  Its funny because they say "you keep your account" as if there is any substance behind that statement when all of your data is gone lol.  Oh you mean my password will still let me login to your website and stare at empty space?  gee thanks!  I'm being petty its really not a big deal, I'm just spoiled by the others who dont do that ... otoh probably they do after a certain amount of time they just dont advertise it.  When they say free forever they dont mean forever forever they just mean they have no plans to delete it in any time frame you would notice.  If you leave it there for a year they will have changed their internal policies and "notified you" through the dashboard 30 days in advance.  
- [AppsBuilder.com](http://www.apps-builder.com/pricing) (0/$16/33/57/68/mo) 2wk free trial. 16 is web only. rest are mobile and web.  68 is a custom branded dashboard for devs to resell this app.  the others let you publish on your own domain with no branding
- [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/app-development-tools-store/rad-studio) first year 2599/4599/6599.  Renewal about 1/4 of that. Free Delphi and C++Builder Community are free until you make 5k
- [Quickbase](https://www.quickbase.com/plans-and-pricing) ($600/mo and up)  Platform for Citizen Development


- ----- Cost per dev per month
- [Wavemaker](https://www.wavemaker.com/pricing/) ($500/Month) Imagine being a [consultant](https://www.wavemaker.com/new-app-development/) and paying them $500/mo for their platform which (theoretically) lets you make any kind of app for any kind of customer.  Customers pay you $5000 for a simple app and you churn it out in a few days and support it for 90 days.  If you can get one customer every few months then its a bargain.  Open Source Runtime so you can run the apps anywhere.
- [4D](https://us.4d.com) ($400/2900/30 day free trial) Adam noticed shitty branding, dubious technological claims, but theyve got 10k people on their forums!?!  are thousands of people paying for this?  Maybe its the ok or even good but I smell kludge.
- [MaxBlox](https://www.maxblox.com) (Quote based so no idea) No free trial.  Stay away.  Examples of [some commission software](https://www.cellarstone.com/maxblox.html) developed in maxblox at least there is some proof that it is real.  I saw some screenshots and it looks shitty and complicated.  Apparently this isnt an app builder but a PaaS platform as a service.  No from their home page: "Low Code App Development Platform" in huge letters.  Big question: What qualities would make you choose to not offer even a 2 week free trial?  If your service is just a few bucks to pay for a month to start thats ... ok I guess but ...
- [Omnis](https://www.omnis.net/developers/resources/pricing.jsp) (Free 90 day trial, 2000 for perpetual license, 200/595/1495/3200/month 3000/7940/17940/38400/yr) This one is hactual programming and they claim they have a great IDE for you.  It looks like they give you lots of examples, but hey its weird to me that its so expensive for an IDE where you have to be technical and program stuff.  More money buys being able to use it on more desktop systems and more devs
- [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com) (0,15,30/user/mo or 120,240,420/user/yr) buying more apps records and features.  Cool feature is 50 ready made apps in this one. Not clearly advertised is their free plan.  15 day free trial converts to the free plan.  Limited premium features but you can still work with your app and data forever.  When you want premium features easily upgrade.  I'm cool with this business model
- [Zoho Creator Plus](https://www.zoho.com/creatorplus/pricing.html) 50/user/mo   Theyve got other apps for every business need
- [Airtable](https://www.g2.com/products/airtable/reviews) Free or $12/24/user/month based on tables or records or sync times or how custom you want your app to be. 
- [Quixy](https://quixy.com/pricing/) ($50/Month for 5 users and up from there) free 21 day trial
- [Tadabase.io](https://tadabase.io/pricing) 74/149/299/649/mo 14 day free trial 10 apps for 74
- [Genexus](https://www.genexus.com/en/usa-en/plans-prices-buy-usa#FAQ_startups) ($300/month/dev however its an annual contract so $3600/yr is more correct) Free 60 day single user trial.  Students $90/yr!
- ----- Charged per END user per month
- [Retool](https://uibakery.io/bubble-alternatives#retool) (0/$10/month/end user?)   in what universe would that be profitable???  I guess if you sold it to the end users for $20/month? hmm ... or what if you know you will only have 1 end user and you can charge them a lot?  $0 and you can only use the app inside the editor interface.  I think theyre trying to push you to upgrade to the enterprise site plan (quote based).  Interesting that you can write javascript in almost any field in the tool.  I suspect that this one is way too technically demanding compared to the rest.  I have a bad feeling about its longevity
- [Outsystems](https://www.outsystems.com/pricing-and-editions/) (0,48000,120000/yr/100 end users) those prices are only for 100 end users.  [Free forever ](https://www.outsystems.com/free-edition/) is hosted in a shared cloud and useful  .  pay on top of those prices for more end users.  (Free forever option for 100 internal users with a smallish database.  could be quite useful for certain things).  wow INSTANT website very impressive.  They have big names and real case studies.  Its odd to me that they charge the same whether you are hosting it in your cloud, on your premesis, or on their hosted system.  They sell you external users. 
- [AppSheet](https://www.g2.com/products/appsheet/pricing) Free forever for personal apps.  $5/user/month or $10/user/month for commercial apps and Geocoding barcode scanning and Scheduled Reports.  Read data from google sheets.  If you stop paying can you keep your app?  Can you keep selling your app? Well Apparently you have to be online to use the app so I presume its always checking to see if you are paid up.  It says you can use free until you are ready to deploy.  You can also use free for personal apps for you forever.  Hopping Forum

- --------------------- Investigate These


# Programming on Mobile #

- PlayCanvas - This one is barely advertised to run on mobile but it should work really well and its cloud based so no storage required.

- AppGameKit literally RUNS on mobile.  Huge ding on what could be so great: it doesnt support BT Keyboards at least on IOS
- SmartBasic is my favorite.  It is really cool and can do a lot I spent a long time with it in bed as I fell asleep making cool graphics programs.  Its even got buttons and UI and stuff and its all documented in app.  It can send programs out to email I think so you can get them out of the app and you can always copy and paste them in and there may even be a better way to get them in.  Then you can even make your OWN APP on your phone from this using some kind of shortcut trick. its pretty awesome.  PLUS you can get a smart basic sdk for xcode and publish your iphone apps in the app store!  Thats pretty damn awesome if you ask me.   GPS, Multitouch, Networking, Music and Video, etc.  This is the one app that reminds me the most of AMOS for Amiga.  It says theres dropbox support and a forum to get answers.  thats awesome.  Update: It even works with bluetooth Keyboard!!!  One of the cool things about this and the other AIOs is how consistent everything is that works within the system.  you have to learn new commands and adapt in small ways you dont have to learn entirely new patterns or paradigms and you certainly dont have to add a bunch of boilerplate code.
- Codea 
- Construct 3
- Basic by miSoft - its a cool throwback, people say its best to dropbox your file and copy and paste it in
- Hotpaw basic like Chipmunk basic interpreter on iphone - not recently updated
- A few others on my old ipad

Programming on Mobile by typing in code and uploading it to a server
- Buffereditor
- Textastic
- Koder
- (there are actually a ton more)
- something Ive got on my phone for coding directly on my server
- Code Anywhere
- Anything that can put code on a server or on a 


Investigate: The smart basic SDK for xcode, I wonder if you can program in basic using that and run it on your mac easily?  its probably not interpreted so theres that but thats a pretty cool possible feature.



# Simple Starting Points #
1. AOZ.studio (see my [Amiga Page](Amiga.md) under AMOSPro for more)
2. OLCConsoleGameEngine [The intro video](https://youtu.be/u5BhrA8ED0o) all of the videos surrounding this video on his page use this engine and a windows console application to make games from nothing using just visual studio and this one dependency (well and iostream)  ALso he has a pixelgameengine that he uses later.
3. SmartBasic
4. AutoIT (GUI Builder) or AutoHotKey


[Replit](https://repl.it) an Online IDE with google docs like capabilities free or $5/mo how to test this: [Atlas Replit Test](https://github.com/epeios-q37/atlas-python)

See my [Amiga Page](Amiga.md) for environment setup



# Amiga Programming #


Amiga Programming Options
Allegro 1 (could then port to Allegro 5)
Purebasic
AMOSPro or AmosProDark or X
Blitzbasic

## AMOSPro ##

From the Marc365 page: This repository is 68k Assembly and unique in design. It is powerful and runs like an operating system. Games and multimedia become exciting to program again, relying on your own skills instead of libraries.

Cool Facebook Group
https://www.facebook.com/groups/AmosPro
There you can get info about the latest source, find the AGA version, and ask questions from a supportive community.

Programming the Amiga installing AMOS the easy way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coOdEs4lJZ0
Here he shows how to get AMOS Pro running from the marc365 repo, also from amosforwindows, and then shows how to change startup sequence to fix paths so the amosforwindows can access the disks

Officially maintained Open Source Repo
https://github.com/marc365/AMOS-Professional-365
This is the official repo now for AMOS Pro Sources.  There are instructions on how to rebuild the whole program in the readme and there is an entire built verison in the /AMOS folder. I've had problems with line endings but once I converted line endings it worked.  If everything fails miserably thats probably the problem.  Someone said using the compiler that when the "Open default screen" in the Compiler Options is set to "No" (which is default) then even simple compiled programs crash. 
I hestitate to even mention this but I have heard of animosity between mark365 and other members of the AMOSPro community as of 2018 but I see no evidence of that at this point.
The compiler is here too but I dont think the examples disk is here

AMIDark - Fork with AGA and HAM8 support
https://github.com/AmiDARK/Amos-Professional-AGA-Releases
Here is the binary only AGA release which is hot and regularly updated.  Its also got HAM8 support recently.  Lots of support from the wizard author Frederic Cordier on the facebook group.
Heres the developer diary and official page of this fork http://amos-professional-aga.frederic-cordier.fr/?developer-diary

Offical Francois Lionet Version
This one is getting no maintenance but is forked from MARc365 and has official MIT license information.  This is important because it is from the original author and sets in stone the license terms which were for a time in 2019 in question and causing a huge political problem with the AGA release and any further substantial development.  I would say this will remain important but only for historical reasons.
https://github.com/AOZ-Studio/AMOS-Professional-Official
This is being maintained however as noted at the [top of this page](http://amos-professional-aga.frederic-cordier.fr)

Francois lionet's new project
https://www.aoz.studio
This is an AMOSPro compatible modern language which can then run in the browser which is pretty damn cool imho.  I believe it generates javascript.  It is supposed to retain compatiblity with old AMOS or AMOSPro programs.  Imho it wont be perfect but will be really good and there will be a certain skillset required to know what needs to change from old commands to the new language.  I hope I'm wrong.  certainly there are new superset commands making it easier to load modern graphics and sound resources.


Amos for Windows 2011
Heres an old 2011 version of AMOSPro running in an old pre-configured version of UAE which just boots quickly into AMOSPro.  Thats pretty cool and requires no setup.  If you want to setup an Amiga see Preconfigured Environments below.
http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=60144&fbclid=IwAR17q7fj3e6PhPT-MTU339anBeq1Fqj5uvjlm7U82Qp6JmSsvmFphq_xvks
It has all of the disks included including the examples disk and productivity disks
Also has some patches to get AMOS3D programs working which is unique and cool.  And there are some 3d examples. 
Also has the AMCAF extension which has faster math, adds and speeds up some graphics routines, adds fancy font support, and fixed protracker.


Resources:

- Aminet/amos
- [AMOS PD CDRom](https://archive.org/details/cdrom-amospdcd) - this is an interesting thing because there are thousands of programs on there, but in my experience virtually none of them work.  I'm sure they work using the right version of amos on the right OS, but I dont have that so it was frustrating to play with them.  OTOH since the source is there, a lot of learning could take place in just reading the source or trying to get them working and changing some things.

I met Alan Kay once.  It changed my life. 

1. [Pharo](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo) Modern Smalltalk.  Updated 17hrs ago.
2. [Amber.js](https://amber-lang.net) A language and live environment built for the javascript runtime.  Updated in the last few weeks.
3. [Seaside](http://www.seaside.st) For sophisticated Web applications in Smalltalk.  Updated in the last few months.  
4. Heres a [huge list of smalltalk projects](http://smalltalkhub.com/list) on a github like site for smalltalk.  Its the wild west though so theres no guarantee any of them will work with your version of pharo.

## Pharo ##
Pharo Sep 15 2020
- I dont seem to be able to run Pharo5 which is the version in the book. Can I run 4?  Is it a 32/64bit problem? Nope it looks like all 32bit images dont run on my 64bit mac.  
- Meta Clicking is Shift OPtion and brings up a halo on the clicked window.  I dont know what all these buttons are but the close button is not the right one to remove the halo.
- Click on the background to remove halos
- Click on background or right click to get to the world menu
- Use the PharoByExample book to get started
- Also use the ProfStef go. to get a hands on tutorial.  ProfStef is awesome.  Shes a great encouraging teacher
-  'Pharo6.0 of 13 May 2016' Update 60547 thats the result of SmalltalkImage current datedVersion. but I chose a 6.1 image ... hmm ... Also it thinks its the 13 of May 2016
- When Going through ProfStef at the beginning of an empty line shift and down arrow selects the whole line.  Shift down down, then cmd p, then backspace, then shift down down to do thenext line.

Command notes:
- single quote for strings, comma to separate $for character.
- single quote string size asUppercase reverse at: 1
- factorial, maxval, asFloat, class, 
- Character allByteCharacters
- (Smalltalk globals at: #ProfStef)
- #(1 2 3) is a literal array.  size.  isEmpty. first.
- in an array at: 2 put: 3; yourself
- Date today + 3 weeks.  Date today < Date yesterday.
- 4 between: 0 and: 10.
- Color: r:1 g:0 b:0
- (0@0 corner: 100@200) class.
- -3 abs negated recriprocal;

I'm on lesson 16/29 and I'm a bit burned out.  Gonna go get a bath I think.

# Assembly #
## Assembly onModern Mac ##
This is actually pretty tricky to do assembly on modern systems unless you really know what you're doing.  

* I got a hello world going from [James Fishers tutorial](
https://jameshfisher.com/2017/02/20/macos-assembly-hello-world/) but then I saw this [nasm tutorial](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/) and was intrigued by the slight differences in the hello world code.  
* I think you could get a lot of information from these commands and operands lower down a bit in [this nasm tutorial](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/) it focuses on the details of the hardware and the most basic assembly commands and also has some mac specific details and a mac specific averaging program at the bottom that takes input and makes output.
* I heard earlier today that really assembly is about the details of the hardware as much as the language.  
* Samuel Evans-Powell figured out some things about [learning NASM on macOS](http://sevanspowell.net/posts/learning-nasm-on-macos.html) like about syscalls and the differences on mac and linux and also in that article he talks about linking c and assembly, and he talks about not absolute addressing on mac osx, and also about padding the stack frame.  It suggests using gcc to link instead of ld which lets you use the c standard library.  
* Here is a [Brainfuck Interpreter](https://www.kylem.net/programming/bf_interp.html) in x86-64 assembly
* Here are some 8086 programs that I can probably get running like I did with nasm on the mac above or with the boot sector approach

### Linking with a C Library ###
I wanted a super simple C Library so I'm going to [write one myself](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-make-your-own-libraries-in-C-programming).  I got it working and was able to call a super simple C library that I made (that just printfs the input number) from assembly.  It sends a number as a parameter but I dont understand the assembly enough yet to decide how to tell it to send an integer.  I got it sending a string (char *) through to the C code though and it worked great!


## Assembly on Modern Linux ##
* This [nasm tutorial](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/) seems really good and also has some mac and win specifics but is mostly linux specific.
* Running 

# Bare Metal #
* This guy [runs some programs on bare metal](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22054578/how-to-run-a-program-without-an-operating-system/32483545#32483545)


# C #
* [Freestanding C programs](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/01/31/) on windows.  this guy wrote some C programs for windows on linux with no external libraries or dependencies except operating System DLLs.  He also wrote some opengl style programs in tiny sizes for DOS (and he wrote those in linux too)

and 
GNAVI (see above)


# Python #
See [Python note](python.md) for how to use python

 Game Engines 

* [Pyglet](https://github.com/pyglet/pyglet) looks amazing and has a really  and some [nice documentation](https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/programming_guide/examplegame.html) and people have [high praise](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/5dgp20/if_the_pyglet_community_is_dead_and_pygame_is_not/) for it.
* [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) is something I played with in like 2004 (iirc) and really wanted to make a tetris game with.  On the main pygame site there are tons of games listed but most of them are unfortunately over 10 years old and dont exist anymore or are unmaintained.
* More are listed in my

 Other cool things about Python
- [Cython](https://cython.org) is a c wrappper system for python to let the two communicate freely and let python call low level functions.  Pretty awesome



# Javascript

[A set of simple Javascript programs](https://github.com/NishiGaba/100-Basic-Javascript-Programs)

# Programming Training
Programming training comes in 1000 varieties so this section is for sites that are relatively general:

* [Study Tonight](https://www.studytonight.com/) offers study resources on a number of languages including tutorials & explanations, hundreds of [example programs](https://www.studytonight.com/c/programs/), [tests you can take](https://www.studytonight.com/tests/?/?subject=c) and [Interview Questions](https://www.studytonight.com/flashcards/Cpp/) to help you sharpen your skills.

# Game Development #
Unity, Unreal are the two big engines. Here are a few more intriguing ones:
1. [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/examples.html) (Straightforward C and OpenGL library with tons of language bindings and lots of capability)

# Makefiles #
[Super simple makefile](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/08/26/makefile-c-projects/)

# Folder Organization #
[Folder Structure by Infallible Code](https://youtu.be/F89PWIk7zec?t=328) It makes sense to keep scripts in scripts folder and textures in textures folder, but it also makes sense to organize conceptually or by object.  Searching lets you find things by name or type easily, but "You can't search by conceptual feature" like the laser dragon boss.  Plus things are often removed or replaced conceptually and delete a folder rather than finding things spread all over your product.  You can use tags too for categories and thats worth doing. 


# Flow charts flowcharts #

This is a language called [Flowgorithm](http://www.flowgorithm.org/download/index.htm) that lets you use simple pseudocode to plot out how your software or algorithms will work

There was something online I think called diagrammr where you would just type simple words on the right and it would make diagrams out of them

Free
yEd Live is free online and works great
Google Drawings is totally free
Draw.io is free
diagrameditor.com works for free

LOVE yEd is free downloadable for win mac lin - The usability is through the roof here even with touchpad.  Scrolling is clunky for some reason, and other parts of the GUI are clumsy.
Pencil is a free downloadable for making GUI Mockups and Diagrams

yUML - this one you just type on the left and it makes a diagram
DrawAnywhere
Sketchboard is free for public projects
This is code for making executable flowcharts with a free editor online

All of these have limited free plans
Cacoo
Gliffy
Creately has a good free plan
Canva



This cool software lets you make diagrams by typing reasonably simple commands its for programmers andit looks pretty great BUT Its $15/mo if you wan to use any of the powerful features or make too big of a diagram.  Still worth checking out

# BASIC #
See my [Amiga Page](Amiga.md) for lots of BASIC

- [Learn BASIC Online](http://www.runbasic.com/seaside/go/runbasic?_s=zmRffWJWpHSEWXSS&_k=zCNyUHwT) with RUNBasic by Libertybasic.  

Learn basic programming by example a 2d game pt 1 is a great intro to purebasic making a game and by 11:20 he has a lot of the boilerplate out of the way so just that one page of code is a great starting point

## Chipmunk Basic ##
- Chipmunk Basic 9/15/2020 for mac is a simple basic interpreter.  It doesnt work like an IDE or a text editor but it works like having a commodore 64 or apple II in this window.  You can load basic programs which dont require line numbers with load "filename" but they have to be in your documents folder for some reason or you can specify the path directly.  A little softlink fixes that problem.  This is so great! It took me right back in time and let me play a game I typed in a few years ago ACEYDUCEY from the book 101 BASIC Computer games.  I think I typed it in anway ... 
9/15/2020 Ive had fun with it.  Its a great way to learn how things used to work back in the day.  I bought a bt mechanical keyboard so I could type some of these old programs in.
ACEY DUCEY from 1010 Basic Computer Games works perfectly as downloaded.  I wonder if the others do too?

# LUA #

Heres a way to compile lua into a GUI executable.  You can even possibly make it self modify its own code!
