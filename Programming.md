"One of the great leaps in OO is to be able to answer the question “How does this work?” with ”I don’t care”." - Pharo By Example 5



# Games And Apps #


Levels of Sophistication

1. 1970s - Simple text games, Space Invaders, 
2. Early 1980s - Pinball, Pac Man, Galaga,
3. Mid 1980s - Bards Tale, 
4. Late 1980s Early 1990s - Eotb, 3D Polygon Racing Games, Wolfenstein, Doom

For Some of these engines the showcases they have so far its a stretch to say that they could make mid 80s games.  For others its easy for them to make crappy looking early 90s games but making a good looking game from any era is out of their reach.

Editors and IDEs
---------------
I like the idea of getting some set of several simple apps working in C/C++/C# or Java and maybe a simple SDL and an OpenGL game and maybe a GUI App or two in all of the following IDEs:
XCode
Visual Studio
NetBeans
Eclipse
IntelliJ IDEA
And then the same apps in these more interesting ones:
Cevelop (C++ IDE with TDD and other great features based on Eclipse)
VSCodium (VSCode low baggage)
JGrasp
Code:Blocks
CodeLite
PyCharm
Ryder for C#
Komodo (with Tkinter)

Ultra Modern GUIs
-----------------
Eventually would like to make some apps in modern GUI libraries like JUCE below or those others

Classic Engines
---------------
Always wanted to make a game in AMOSPro
Always wanted to make a game in BlitzMax
Always wanted to make a game in PyGame
-----------------------------------
Always wanted to make a game in DarkBasic
Always wanted to make a game in ncurses
Would be so proud to write a Genesis game in SGDK

Notably Slow Websites:
---------------------
Some of these have lightning fast websites which makes a big impression on me.  Others are quite slows


Investigate:
----------------
QuickBASIC, PowerBASIC, XBasic, Turbo Basic, Visual Basic, FutureBASIC, REALbasic, FreeBASIC. R,

Defold
pysdl2 Updated this year!
What do I have in my humble bundle and steam accounts?
AGKJava
Delphi for DOS perhaps?
Which situations can I best directly access OpenGL or Vulkan calls and still have some surrounding game engine niceties?
Command Line Graphics LIbraries
Command Line GUI Libraries
All other GUI Libraries
All C++/Java/C# Gaming Libraries that aren't a whole environment or IDE
GameGuru
FPSCreator Classic the Game creators
Pico 8 , GDevelop, PixelVision 8, VOxatron, Godot Game Engine and many more
Those are maybe engines but definitely discords

Notes

- Enigma - Game Maker compatible.  Speeds up game maker games.  They are hardcore about preventing SPAM.   [Enigma Wiki](https://enigma-dev.org/docs/Wiki/Main_Page), [Enigma Discord](https://discord.gg/Kz67atZ)31/159, they have an IRC Channel (but thats off limits to me for an unexplained or broken reason) The [Enigma forum](https://enigma-dev.org/forums/) is pretty active too.  If you ask me this is a good thing to have in your pocket if you are doing game maker stuff.  If there is enough stability and support that you can use it instead of game maker then I think its even better.  Game maker is apparently great though but last time I checked (a few months ago) their community is toxic and I'm not interested in that crap (although I might like to go watch the shit show sometime).
- Game Maker - Rumor has it that there are some trolls in the community but perhaps they were left behind at the skype chat group they had?  Apparently the subreddits discord is surprisingly 'un-reddit'
- The Game Creators [The Game Creators Forum - AppGameKit GameGuru FPS Creator](https://forum.thegamecreators.com) + Steam + Facebook - Strange that people on their forum were resistant to them even having a discord.  They thought it would hurt the community to split the spread of information.  that seems old fashioned or conservative, and certainly they dont understand the role that discord (or any live chat) serves in the communication space.  The forum for FPS creator is most hopping strangely, maybe because [FPS Creator is open source](https://github.com/TheGameCreators/FPS-Creator-Classic)?  The forum for FPS creator is pretty active.  Well all of the assetpacks are there too which is awesome!   Wow all the art packs are here too!  Vague not legally worded license but it clearly says you can sell. 
- I got a weird vibe about clickteam theres a [whole article about how bizarre they are](https://iwantabro.com/kimmoa/The_bizarre_world_of_Clickteam) and one dude claims they banned him from discord for wanting to get his images out of the game binary.  I'll choose to take that story with a grain of salt but it makes me scratch my head.  They've got a huge discord though thats impressive.  5 times bigger than appgamekit.  I love Francois Lionet though but I got a weird vibe from him too about licensing for AMOSPro, now thats been resolved at this point but it was tense there for about a year on the facebook group.  
- Cryengine there is a forum and answers group which are decidedly not dead but neither hopping.  Theres a large discord though.
- FNA.  XNA is how people would make games for Xbox 360 Live Arcade back in the day.  Well now for people who have that code they can use the instructions on the wiki and get it working again with modern open source technology.  Their code isnt dead.  In addition it looks like a real straightforward C# game engine in code according to one of the tutorials and I like that very much.  Looks like no matter what though using this would tie you to the XNA legacy and that doesn't seem ideal for example shipping requires some pack ins , not a big deal but ... The discord is hopping though, the tutorial is great, and they have more modern tech than their sister MonoGame which is XNA-Like.  FNA uses just one assembly and as a result its more likely to run identically on every platform.  Tons of games: Bastion, Axiom Verge, Celeste, Escape Goat, Dust, Fez, Owlboy, Rogue Legacy, Terraria, Transistor, even Streets of Rage 4!  I dont see any tutorials about like importing 3d assets, and theres no IDE associated.  Monogame tutorials should be similar and there should be a way to port things to FNA from Monogame if that would be valuable.  Apparently there used to be something called XNA Game Studio.   It was a fork of Monogame at one point.  
- Buildbox Huge discord community which is a great triumph I didnt expect.  
	- Huge website failure: if you want to see whats at thebottom, you cant on the blog page, because it infinitely refreshes with more posts.  You have to chase the bottom bar utnil you give up and figure out that one of the other tabs might work better.  Regardless the website feels sparse and kind of empty.  Thats generally ok but its something they could work on if they feel they want to make a better impression.  Advice?  Clearer Navigation perhaps?  I dont know for sure.  
	- Probably great software but to do in app purchases its a relatively expensive option at $50/mo with a 1yr committment for a small dev.  Will the game even make that much?  Will you get it out the door at all if you dont use Buildbox?  Interesting conundrum.   
	- Theres a [Nice Tutorial](https://www.buildbox.com/make-your-own-game/) that walks you through a whole game with videos and a document. 
- [S2 Engine](https://www.s2powered.com/copiasito/) 16/114 discord.  Generally positive reviews on Steam, but their website is cryptic and so is my impressions from the reviews. its only $20 one time, and importantly it is absolutely getting monthly or several times a month updates from the devs.  I find myself liking this one more and more the more I look and some say they find it a better easier smoother package than unreal or unity.  Theres an awesome $35 procedural building maker too.  Also you can get a free version of their slightly older version 1.4.5 actually thats probably quite a bit older now tbh.  oh 809 people on the FB Group not bad!
- [NeoAxis Engine](https://www.neoaxis.com/neoaxis/downloads) Open Source WIndows Only, has all of the major features of the major players.  Its brand new, lots of action on github.  Small discord, some forum activity.  Are they going to make money with this?  If not how will it survive?  Perhaps by making custom projects for people which is right in the top level menu of their products. 
- [GLBasic](http://glbasic.com) Weird that their website has a mobile menu even at the largest desktop resolutions.  Not a show stopper. Only community is a forum afaik.  They need way more showcases to show off what it can do.  And more tutorials and stuff.  However I love this one imho.  Nevermind they have tons of examples and showcases.  I love this one.  I wonder if these will still be compatible with newer versions of the software and if not thats a big problem that they need to offer all previous version clearly and easily to purchasers.  It has some 3d Engine Commands in the $80 upgrade
- [Platformer Game Engine](https://wohlsoft.ru) shitty slow website but it covers most bases.  It looks like this was based on a SMB related fan game.  I caught the git hub having been changed just 3 minutes ago.  Thats a good sign.  18/52 Discord. Its been going strong on github since 2014 with many contributors!  1000 members in the forum.  
- Gamesalad has no free option, I dont know if the author supports, forums are active, no discord, Interestingly there is a large arcade on their site since thats built into their business model and the games look good.  
- Blitzmax,	BASIC	Win Mac Lin,	1,		4,		2,	9,		10,		0,		I bought a license for this probably 15yrs ago and I still think very highly of it.  I can only find a tiny discord community where about 20 people hang out.  Thats not bad for something virtually unsupported.  Still its open source now and thats nice.  I have such good feelings about it that I want to love it and make games in it but I just wonder where I will hit my head against a glass ceiling and at that point its not worth it.   I think though that I would feel good making a game in this even if it took me a while since its something I've always wanted to do.  Same with AMOSPro. Syntaxbomb forums for blitz are still active
- Monkey, BASIC, This is cross platform and compiles down to HTML5 so it seems like it would be great but it has no traction.  I dont really know why they ditched blitz and call it monkey but it doesnt seem like it worked imho.  Theres 0.1 community activity and no updates for 2 years.  The Blitz Basic Guy Mark Sibley is a genius though and I bet this is a really good system.  AOZStudio is trying almost the same thing right now but I hope it gets more traction.  Cerberus has a bit more traction.  Monkey still has a decent community though.
- Darkbasic Pro, BASIC, this one is on github and it looks reasonably well organized and for that reason may be supportable in the future but it looks like there is no community activity around it.
- Basic4GL,	BASIC,	Win,			1,		1,		2,	8,		9		0,		Love the simplicity of OpenGL with this.  Could compile to mobile too?




Interesting Ones:
----------------

- RenPy is a super simple python visual novel engine
- Vassal Engine for making online board games even play by email! very recently udpated, 
- RunBASIC is Liberty Basic but for a server and does the serving for you so you can easily make web applications hosted on server or pc.  $60 with a free demo



Saying No to:
----------------

Name, 	    Lanugage, Platforms,   Developer,  	  Community	Install	Access,	Cost,	Notes
				                 Activity    Activity  Size	Ease	    -ability,			

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- GameEditor,	C,		Win Mac,		6,		3,		1,	5,		8,		0,		This C is intriguing. Constraints are nice. 2013 last update
- RapidQ,		BASIC,	Win Lin,		2,		2,		2,	7,		9,		0,		
- Multimedia Fusion - Replaced by Clickteam Fusion
- ScriptBasic Cool because you could run it lightning fast on a certain web server without CGI overhead.  That is a really clever idea.  
- HBasic GPL and linux with forms for GUIs and using KDE Libraries.  Looks good
- Turbulenz, Looks polished and promising but theres no activity for 5 yrs
- Blender Game Engine
- pylove Dead
- Blitz3D, 	BASIC,	Win,			0,		1,		1,	9,		6,		0,		I've always thought this would be really cool
- AxisGFactory,Drag,	Win Mac Lin,	3,		2,		1,		Just for Terrains
- Power Game Factory.  This looks great ... the testimonials are glowing ... but it looks ancient too.   Nope it died in 2012 when Lion came out breaking their software :(  I'm honestly surprised I didnt know about this back then. I would have probably loved it, mac, 2d game creation, right up my alley tbh.  
- Tululoo Game Maker dead.  2013.
- [Scroller](http://percsich.hu/sgc/) Scroller Game Creator, download and add triggers and sprites and make a game really easily.  Broken no undo feature as of 2015.
- Axis Game Factory (Dead), $20 ($10 on steam) - Really a level design tool not a whole game engine.  Voxel Sculpt is $30 AGFProPremium is $80 and allows Multiplayer 8 player Simultaneous Design! Its a DLC on top of the $20 Rapid Level Development Toolset, website looks crappy, engine looks cool enough.  Its got a DLC called VoxelSculpt which looks fucking amazing!  I like how it lets you place start and end points for each level and also lets you add story elements.  Collaborate with Friends somehow (maybe just send them a .exe?).  Watching the prmotional video it looks a little clumsy and like coppercube in the sense that the features probably work but they also require that you do things a certain way and its a bit non standard and clunky for example I have no idea what their packaging exe feature was since distributing your software as an exe shouldnt really be a feature but totally a given.  OH!  its designed to work in concert with Unity.  "provide game developers and enthusiasts with a powerful and rapid level creation, terrain vegetation editing, lighting and atmosphere system."  Its got some cool DLC players like a first person shooter and a fantasy side scroller.  The DLC is cheaper on steam than on their website, but its all from 2013-2015 and the website implies that it takes some monkeying to get things working.  I can't imagine that the mac or linux versions even run.
- [Silent Walk FPS Creator](http://www.silentworks.hu/sw/editor.php) Maybe not technically dead still not appealing.  A doom or wolf editor would be better.  
- [Silent Walk Renaissance](http://www.silentworks.hu/swr/features.php) requires xp or 7 so its pretty ancient.    I suspect it was cool what they pulled off at the time though,  
- [Megakerma Maker](http://www.silentworks.hu/mk/features.php) a whole game engine by the same people.  Sort of amazing there was a small team in hungary doing this but its xp so ancient. 
- [Maratis](http://www.maratis3d.org/?page_id=57) died in 2013
- [Platinum Arts Sandbox](https://www.sandboxgamemaker.com/make-a-game-sandbox-faq/) Author still around but project is discontinued
- [Game Builder by Google](https://github.com/googlearchive/gamebuilder) looks like an experimental teaching tool with absolutely zero traction
- Mokoi - Dead in 2015.  Was probably great
- Reality Factory - Dead in 2015
- [Flixel](http://flixel.org/help.html) - This is powerful with lots of games made for it (Canabalt and the best of flash games from 2009 or so), however since its flash its just too old, there are apparently some other projects built on top of it that might be good.  Its got some unique features like moving thousands of objects and also debugging, and recording and replaying information (which is totally bad ass).  Tilemaps, Particles, Physics collisions.  Good thing I saw some little comment on slant that there are also ports, C# is dead, C is dead, Monkey X is dead, HaxeFlixel is ALIVE and Kicking!!
- Wave Engine (deets in spreadsheet)
- Polycode (details in spreadsheet)
- Loom SDK (Purchased and dead in 2017)
- GDevApp (Site Gone)
- Crafty.js - Github not updated since 2018.  Forums still talking every few months.
- Haxepunk - last release 2018, they have touched it since but theres no momentum or community
- Spritekit - probably not actually dead but being an Apple product this is very different. Its not the same evaluation as the rest, nor would I believe for a second that it will be more accessible.  Obviously not cross platform either.  OTOH its probably fine for some since it might be the most battery efficient way to make an ios app.
- Flat Red Ball - Activity not actually dead, and there is a small discord so its def not dead, but the website doesn't funnel me in so I dont know why I would pick it in fact it seems based on old stuff and it seems confusing.  There are some demos and tuts on there though so its not terrible and I have nothing against it, but its not fresh enough for me.

# RAD GUIs #


Visual tools for developing traditional desktop GUIs

- LibertyBasic $60 Win Only
- LiveCode - From the Runtime Revolution devs and related to Hypercard
- Lazarus Pascal
- PureBasic 
- Gambas BASIC with Forms in IDE
- CodeTyphon
- B4x
- CrossUI 
- ---- 2nd tier
- PascalABC
- Freebasic with WinFBE

To be fair lots or most of the IDEs and Languages have some level of GUI Builder associated or compatible.  I have mostly only listed the ones which have a sort of official one.  To be fair to the other side of the coin most of the third party or unofficial ones are not great in some way or sparsely supported.  Its kind of like when N64 had four player support built into the system and no one else did, it was the party game console because of it.  Other systems had a few 4+ player games but since you had to buy the extra piece it wasnt supported as well or as widely.  To be fair to those with third party GUI BUilders again, I suspect that for some 10% of the ones I haven't looked into they are really good and supported and even heavily used and Ive missed that.  Let me know if that is the case for your favorite IDE.


Unusual Desktop GUIs

- FreePascal comes with FreeVision which is a dos looking GUI builder
- Rebol makes little 

GUIs from Code

- Pharo Smalltalk - This seems like a good option although Smalltalk is so foreign to me at this point
- Ultimate++
- Fyne with Go (tiny amounts of code to get simple apps running)
- GTK with C# with Stetic (included with MonoDevelop)
- wxWidgets with C++ - well documented with a pretty big community and probably not too hard to get working.  regularly updated
- Python with TkInter and Komodo (For graphically building the GUI - Totally Pro - Now Free)
- ----- 2nd Tier
- React like Adam is doing is great
- CEGUI with CEED (Nice GUI by same people)(old)
- Python with wxPython and wxGlade
- IUP - super simple library C, LUA, only Win and Lin
- FLTK and FLUID with C++ (This library seems really great because of how small and lightweight it is - but looks like accessibility is poor)
- ----- 3rd Tier
- FOX Toolkit is lightweight and modern, doesnt run on mac but looks unique and apparently runs very fast
- fpgui is old but super lightweight and multiplatform
- AGAR cross platform and claims to be easy to get into (I have my doubts)
- Avalonia - Cross platform dotnet based XML GUI system - Nice tutorial makes it pretty easy to start, otoh it looks way too wordy and complicated to me personally
- AmberJS Smalltalk for web apps
- Python with DearPyGUI
- Python with Guietta
- Python with PySimpleGUI
- Python with PySide
- Python with TkInter
- (Many More libraries out there in the wild, I bet some of them are miraculous)


A future of new GUIs (most accessible to current web developers)

- UNO - Pixel perfect multi platform (including web assembly) C# development UI Library.  This looks totally awesome and polished and well supported
- Nuklear - IM Mode Library in one file real easy to use in C or C++
- Sciter - Embeddable HTML/CSS/script engine for modern UI Development
- GLFW - Gives you a window and opengl context with just two lines. high tech graphical potential, c# bindings just released 2 wks ago, open source.  Very appealings
- DearImGUI (with a game engine or SDL or Conan) (tutorials lacking, community can be shitty, there is a discord and github forum, the apparent simplicity is appealing, the wild west nature of the environment gives me the runs)
- Lots of options with CEF - its about making your web app into a desktop app
- JUCE for really interesting UIs (particularly for music) - Free
- Electron - Twitch WhatsApp VSCode all built in electron - uses lots of resources tho


Expensive ones aka RAD aka No Code Development platforms aka low code development platforms

- -----Reasonably expensive------------
- Bubble.io (Free for bubble branded app, $25/mo for whitelabel, $115-475 for more server capacity and development versions of your app)
- CrossUI ($1000 one time) (this looks like some of the most legit SOFTWARE on the list - more like the IDEs Ive listed above)  its totally free for non profit individual use, and looks like it can export to any desktop or web app or mobile ... but do they mean ios app store with iap?  License bound to a computer.  Demo fast loading and free [right here](https://www.crossui.com/RAD/) - they have student discounts and academic institutions.  They will delete projects in online app builder demo thing from time to time.  Update: it says desktop version is [totally free for individual non profit use](https://www.crossui.com/download.html).  Or you can use [this online one](https://www.crossui.com/RADGithub/) for free but the app requires the ability to delete any of your repos to which you have admin rights.  HELLS NO!  Maybe a new account for this would be best or just use the desktop.
- ----- 2nd tier
- Infinible (free,20,50,100/mo) only for web, you can create MIT code plugins, not desktop or mobile
- Zeroqode ($100-300/app template - choose from 113 templates - $25-35 features to drop into Bubble.io)
- Wapler for making websites quickly ($20-40/mo for individuals) - this one rumor has it you own the code somewhat which is different with Bubble
- AppsBuilder.com ($15-60/mo)
- Inboldsolutions (Free-25/mo)
- Appery.io ($25-600/mo)
- openbuild.io (0,20,50/mo) Make little apps for bubble with custom UI themes
- UIBakery (0,16,33,67/mo) [Comparison with Bubble and others](https://uibakery.io/bubble-alternatives)
- Configure.it (9,49,79,199/mo) or 799 once with source code
- Webflow (free forever, 12, 16, 35, account based or site based options)
- Zoho (10,25,35,40/mo)
- ------Unreasonably expensive ------------
- RAD Studio Embarcadero
- 4D ($400-2900 free trial)
- MaxBlox (Quote based so no idea)
- Quixy ($50/Month for 5 users and up from there)
- Wavemaker ($500/Month/User)
- Genexus ($300/month/user)
- (There are literally dozens of others like this many with a free trial)
- Outsystems (Free forever for limited scale, to scale up just a bit is $6000/month paid annually!)
- Tadbase.io (is $60-500/month)
- Quickbase ($500-1600/mo)


Comments on the expensive ones: https://forum.bubble.io/t/other-no-code-alternatives/64510

# Programming on Mobile #

- AppGameKit literally RUNS on mobile.  Huge ding on what could be so great: it doesnt support BT Keyboards at least on IOS
- SmartBasic is my favorite.  It is really cool and can do a lot I spent a long time with it in bed as I fell asleep making cool graphics programs.  Its even got buttons and UI and stuff and its all documented in app.  It can send programs out to email I think so you can get them out of the app and you can always copy and paste them in and there may even be a better way to get them in.  Then you can even make your OWN APP on your phone from this using some kind of shortcut trick. its pretty awesome.  PLUS you can get a smart basic sdk for xcode and publish your iphone apps in the app store!  Thats pretty damn awesome if you ask me.   GPS, Multitouch, Networking, Music and Video, etc.  This is the one app that reminds me the most of AMOS for Amiga.  It says theres dropbox support and a forum to get answers.  thats awesome.  
- Codea 
- Construct 3
- Basic by miSoft - its a cool throwback, people say its best to dropbox your file and copy and paste it in
- Hotpaw basic like Chipmunk basic interpreter on iphone - not recently updated
- A few others on my old ipad

Programming on Mobile by typing in code and uploading it to a server
- Buffereditor
- Textastic
- Koder
- (there are actually a ton more)
- something Ive got on my phone for coding directly on my server



Investigate: The smart basic SDK for xcode, I wonder if you can program in basic using that and run it on your mac easily?  its probably not interpreted so theres that but thats a pretty cool possible feature.



# Simplest Starting Points #
1. AOZ.studio (see my [Amiga Page](Amiga.md) under AMOSPro for more)
2. OLCConsoleGameEngine [The intro video](https://youtu.be/u5BhrA8ED0o) all of the videos surrounding this video on his page use this engine and a windows console application to make games from nothing using just visual studio and this one dependency (well and iostream)  ALso he has a pixelgameengine that he uses later.
3. SmartBasic
4. AutoIT (GUI Builder) or AutoHotKey

# Amiga Programming #


Amiga Programming Options
Allegro 1 (could then port to Allegro 5)
Purebasic
AMOSPro or AmosProDark or X
Blitzbasic

## AMOSPro ##

From the Marc365 page: This repository is 68k Assembly and unique in design. It is powerful and runs like an operating system. Games and multimedia become exciting to program again, relying on your own skills instead of libraries.

Cool Facebook Group
https://www.facebook.com/groups/AmosPro
There you can get info about the latest source, find the AGA version, and ask questions from a supportive community.

Programming the Amiga installing AMOS the easy way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coOdEs4lJZ0
Here he shows how to get AMOS Pro running from the marc365 repo, also from amosforwindows, and then shows how to change startup sequence to fix paths so the amosforwindows can access the disks

Officially maintained Open Source Repo
https://github.com/marc365/AMOS-Professional-365
This is the official repo now for AMOS Pro Sources.  There are instructions on how to rebuild the whole program in the readme and there is an entire built verison in the /AMOS folder. I've had problems with line endings but once I converted line endings it worked.  If everything fails miserably thats probably the problem.  Someone said using the compiler that when the "Open default screen" in the Compiler Options is set to "No" (which is default) then even simple compiled programs crash. 
I hestitate to even mention this but I have heard of animosity between mark365 and other members of the AMOSPro community as of 2018 but I see no evidence of that at this point.
The compiler is here too but I dont think the examples disk is here

AMIDark - Fork with AGA and HAM8 support
https://github.com/AmiDARK/Amos-Professional-AGA-Releases
Here is the binary only AGA release which is hot and regularly updated.  Its also got HAM8 support recently.  Lots of support from the wizard author Frederic Cordier on the facebook group.
Heres the developer diary and official page of this fork http://amos-professional-aga.frederic-cordier.fr/?developer-diary

Offical Francois Lionet Version
This one is getting no maintenance but is forked from MARc365 and has official MIT license information.  This is important because it is from the original author and sets in stone the license terms which were for a time in 2019 in question and causing a huge political problem with the AGA release and any further substantial development.  I would say this will remain important but only for historical reasons.
https://github.com/AOZ-Studio/AMOS-Professional-Official
This is being maintained however as noted at the [top of this page](http://amos-professional-aga.frederic-cordier.fr)

Francois lionet's new project
https://www.aoz.studio
This is an AMOSPro compatible modern language which can then run in the browser which is pretty damn cool imho.  I believe it generates javascript.  It is supposed to retain compatiblity with old AMOS or AMOSPro programs.  Imho it wont be perfect but will be really good and there will be a certain skillset required to know what needs to change from old commands to the new language.  I hope I'm wrong.  certainly there are new superset commands making it easier to load modern graphics and sound resources.


Amos for Windows 2011
Heres an old 2011 version of AMOSPro running in an old pre-configured version of UAE which just boots quickly into AMOSPro.  Thats pretty cool and requires no setup.  If you want to setup an Amiga see Preconfigured Environments below.
http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=60144&fbclid=IwAR17q7fj3e6PhPT-MTU339anBeq1Fqj5uvjlm7U82Qp6JmSsvmFphq_xvks
It has all of the disks included including the examples disk and productivity disks
Also has some patches to get AMOS3D programs working which is unique and cool.  And there are some 3d examples. 
Also has the AMCAF extension which has faster math, adds and speeds up some graphics routines, adds fancy font support, and fixed protracker.


Resources:

- Aminet/amos
- [AMOS PD CDRom](https://archive.org/details/cdrom-amospdcd) - this is an interesting thing because there are thousands of programs on there, but in my experience virtually none of them work.  I'm sure they work using the right version of amos on the right OS, but I dont have that so it was frustrating to play with them.  OTOH since the source is there, a lot of learning could take place in just reading the source or trying to get them working and changing some things.

## Pharo ##
Pharo Sep 15 2020
- I dont seem to be able to run Pharo5 which is the version in the book. Can I run 4?  Is it a 32/64bit problem? Nope it looks like all 32bit images dont run on my 64bit mac.  
- Meta Clicking is Shift OPtion and brings up a halo on the clicked window.  I dont know what all these buttons are but the close button is not the right one to remove the halo.
- Click on the background to remove halos
- Click on background or right click to get to the world menu
- Use the PharoByExample book to get started
- Also use the ProfStef go. to get a hands on tutorial.  ProfStef is awesome.  Shes a great encouraging teacher
-  'Pharo6.0 of 13 May 2016' Update 60547 thats the result of SmalltalkImage current datedVersion. but I chose a 6.1 image ... hmm ... Also it thinks its the 13 of May 2016
- When Going through ProfStef at the beginning of an empty line shift and down arrow selects the whole line.  Shift down down, then cmd p, then backspace, then shift down down to do thenext line.

Command notes:
- single quote for strings, comma to separate $for character.
- single quote string size asUppercase reverse at: 1
- factorial, maxval, asFloat, class, 
- Character allByteCharacters
- (Smalltalk globals at: #ProfStef)

- 4 between: 0 and: 10.
- Color: r:1 g:0 b:0
- (0@0 corner: 100@200) class.
- -3 abs negated recriprocal;

I'm on lesson 16/29 and I'm a bit burned out.  Gonna go get a bath I think.

# Assembly #
## Assembly onModern Mac ##
This is actually pretty tricky to do assembly on modern systems unless you really know what you're doing.  

* I got a hello world going from [James Fishers tutorial](
https://jameshfisher.com/2017/02/20/macos-assembly-hello-world/) but then I saw this [nasm tutorial](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/) and was intrigued by the slight differences in the hello world code.  
* I think you could get a lot of information from these commands and operands lower down a bit in [this nasm tutorial](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/) it focuses on the details of the hardware and the most basic assembly commands and also has some mac specific details and a mac specific averaging program at the bottom that takes input and makes output.
* I heard earlier today that really assembly is about the details of the hardware as much as the language.  
* Samuel Evans-Powell figured out some things about [learning NASM on macOS](http://sevanspowell.net/posts/learning-nasm-on-macos.html) like about syscalls and the differences on mac and linux and also in that article he talks about linking c and assembly, and he talks about not absolute addressing on mac osx, and also about padding the stack frame.  It suggests using gcc to link instead of ld which lets you use the c standard library.  
* Here is a [Brainfuck Interpreter](https://www.kylem.net/programming/bf_interp.html) in x86-64 assembly
* Here are some 8086 programs that I can probably get running like I did with nasm on the mac above or with the boot sector approach

### Linking with a C Library ###
I wanted a super simple C Library so I'm going to [write one myself](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-make-your-own-libraries-in-C-programming).  I got it working and was able to call a super simple C library that I made (that just printfs the input number) from assembly.  It sends a number as a parameter but I dont understand the assembly enough yet to decide how to tell it to send an integer.  I got it sending a string (char *) through to the C code though and it worked great!


## Assembly on Modern Linux ##
* This [nasm tutorial](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/) seems really good and also has some mac and win specifics but is mostly linux specific.
* Running 

# Bare Metal #
* This guy [runs some programs on bare metal](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22054578/how-to-run-a-program-without-an-operating-system/32483545#32483545)


# C #
* [Freestanding C programs](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/01/31/) on windows.  this guy wrote some C programs for windows on linux with no external libraries or dependencies except operating System DLLs.  He also wrote some opengl style programs in tiny sizes for DOS (and he wrote those in linux too)

# C++ #
* To make SDL style grpahics with C++ (bindings for C and C# and others) use [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/faq.php#grl-whatis)

# Python #
See [Python note](python.md)


# Javascript

[A set of simple Javascript programs](https://github.com/NishiGaba/100-Basic-Javascript-Programs)

# Programming Training
Programming training comes in 1000 varieties so this section is for sites that are relatively general:

* [Study Tonight](https://www.studytonight.com/) offers study resources on a number of languages including tutorials & explanations, hundreds of [example programs](https://www.studytonight.com/c/programs/), [tests you can take](https://www.studytonight.com/tests/?/?subject=c) and [Interview Questions](https://www.studytonight.com/flashcards/Cpp/) to help you sharpen your skills.

# Game Development #
Unity, Unreal are the two big engines. Here are a few more intriguing ones:
1. [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/examples.html) (Straightforward C and OpenGL library with tons of language bindings and lots of capability)

# Makefiles #
[Super simple makefile](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/08/26/makefile-c-projects/)

# Folder Organization #
[Folder Structure by Infallible Code](https://youtu.be/F89PWIk7zec?t=328) It makes sense to keep scripts in scripts folder and textures in textures folder, but it also makes sense to organize conceptually or by object.  Searching lets you find things by name or type easily, but "You can't search by conceptual feature" like the laser dragon boss.  Plus things are often removed or replaced conceptually and delete a folder rather than finding things spread all over your product.  You can use tags too for categories and thats worth doing. 


# Flow charts flowcharts #

This is a language called [Flowgorithm](http://www.flowgorithm.org/download/index.htm) that lets you use simple pseudocode to plot out how your software or algorithms will work

There was something online I think called diagrammr where you would just type simple words on the right and it would make diagrams out of them

Free
yEd Live is free online and works great
Google Drawings is totally free
Draw.io is free
diagrameditor.com works for free

LOVE yEd is free downloadable for win mac lin - The usability is through the roof here even with touchpad.  Scrolling is clunky for some reason, and other parts of the GUI are clumsy.
Pencil is a free downloadable for making GUI Mockups and Diagrams

yUML - this one you just type on the left and it makes a diagram
DrawAnywhere
Sketchboard is free for public projects
This is code for making executable flowcharts with a free editor online

All of these have limited free plans
Cacoo
Gliffy
Creately has a good free plan
Canva



This cool software lets you make diagrams by typing reasonably simple commands its for programmers andit looks pretty great BUT Its $15/mo if you wan to use any of the powerful features or make too big of a diagram.  Still worth checking out

# BASIC #
See my [Amiga Page](Amiga.md) for lots of BASIC

- [Learn BASIC Online](http://www.runbasic.com/seaside/go/runbasic?_s=zmRffWJWpHSEWXSS&_k=zCNyUHwT) with RUNBasic by Libertybasic.  

Learn basic programming by example a 2d game pt 1 is a great intro to purebasic making a game and by 11:20 he has a lot of the boilerplate out of the way so just that one page of code is a great starting point

## Chipmunk Basic ##
- Chipmunk Basic 9/15/2020 for mac is a simple basic interpreter.  It doesnt work like an IDE or a text editor but it works like having a commodore 64 or apple II in this window.  You can load basic programs which dont require line numbers with load "filename" but they have to be in your documents folder for some reason or you can specify the path directly.  A little softlink fixes that problem.  This is so great! It took me right back in time and let me play a game I typed in a few years ago ACEYDUCEY from the book 101 BASIC Computer games.  I think I typed it in anway ... 
9/15/2020 Ive had fun with it.  Its a great way to learn how things used to work back in the day.  I bought a bt mechanical keyboard so I could type some of these old programs in.
ACEY DUCEY from 1010 Basic Computer Games works perfectly as downloaded.  I wonder if the others do too?
