"One of the great leaps in OO is to be able to answer the question “How does this work?” with ”I don’t care”." - Pharo By Example 5

Dont know where to put this: TO figure out what behaviors might be needed for a game engines scripts or nodes or whatever see the Construct 3 docs 'behavior reference'

# Games And Apps #


Levels of Sophistication

1. 1970s - Simple text games, Space Invaders, 
2. Early 1980s - Pinball, Pac Man, Galaga,
3. Mid 1980s - Bards Tale, 
4. Late 1980s Early 1990s - Eotb, 3D Polygon Racing Games, Wolfenstein, Doom

For Some of these engines the showcases they have so far its a stretch to say that they could make mid 80s games.  For others its easy for them to make crappy looking early 90s games but making a good looking game from any era is out of their reach.

# Interesting Programming Options 2020 #

## Sorting these Game Engines ##

This is what I want to find and for you to be able to find:
"We make no claim that ______ is the best game engine out there for any game, but we dare to say that ______ is the best game engine for some games."
For the type of game or games you are making: what is the best engine for that?

Each type of game has its own ocean and the different game engines live at different depths of the ocean.
How deep do you have to go to do something with this language? = That HTML 3D language 0 Leagues Puzzlescript 1 League (only 20 Leagues Deep)
How deep can you go and still do things with this language?  Unity Unreal = 20,000 Leagues
Some engines are located at the area near "Hot Reload" Island.  Feature Island.

What is a game engine? [Allegro](https://liballeg.org/index.html) says it "Allegro is not a game engine: you are free to design and structure your program as you like" which makes me think of the game loop and opinionated things like that are what make the difference between a game engine and a multimedia or game library or resource. 
For this reason a game engine could be with or without an IDE or any kind of scene manager.


Prediction: One or two of these engines or libraries will be very old so I will dismiss it, but in fact it will have a thriving non-obviouscommunity who is super happy with its feature complete stable situation and how well it works even on all modern computers, and I will miss out on that one.  Most of the old things are just dead though. 
Favorite Features:

AppGyver
"How can we afford to do this? Why?
We've been around for ten years, and we've always provided free plans for smaller organizations and indie developers while focusing on large enterprises as our paying customers. With Composer Pro, we're just continuing this tradition. We believe that in order to build a global community of visual programmers, everybody needs to have access to the same platform. That's why."

XCode
Visual Studio
NetBeans
Eclipse
IntelliJ IDEA
And then the same apps in these more interesting ones:
Cevelop (C++ IDE with TDD and other great features based on Eclipse)
VSCodium (VSCode low baggage)
JGrasp

Some of these have lightning fast websites which makes a big impression on me.  Others are quite slows










Incorporate my notes and my saying no tos  below into my spreadsheet somehow or at least have another gander at them.  Some will be truly dead.  Others will be working just fine but not having updates recently
Also incorporate the game based engines below, 
and then on teh creative tab put all of those into the correct format
And then on the tlos and libraries tab put those into the correct format too ... maybe

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- [Chipmunk](https://chipmunk-physics.net/aboutChipmunk.php) Update: Its just for physics so its not so sad after all.  this one is sad.  The forum and updates are dead since 2019 but this has a lot of background and was probably some of the fastest tech in the world.  Its on github so its not dead forever but atm no community at all.  it says hundreds of shippign games and has benchmarks to show its speed.  It has some autogeometry to generate physics geometry from images for collisions which is pretty bad ass.  Also [Chipmunk in C#](https://github.com/netonjm/ChipmunkSharp) which also died in 2019
- [Vue.js](Vue.js) - Cool thouhg that the community is so huge (88k on discord alone!)  Just watching the intro video gave me the willies because it seemed like so much unnecessary baggage.  I could be wrong and biased though. 
- Wave Engine	C#	Win Mac Lin	VR iOS Xbox Android WMR Oculus SteamVR Leap Wasm More 	Like 2005 3D Graphics	7 not abandoned, site sparse	Zero Community	4 probably ok, but you're totally on your own	Full Featured 3D Models Animation Particles	All Free	1						
- GameEditor,	C,		Win Mac,		6,		3,		1,	5,		8,		0,		This C is intriguing. Constraints are nice. 2013 last update
- RapidQ,		BASIC,	Win Lin,		2,		2,		2,	7,		9,		0,		
- Multimedia Fusion - Replaced by Clickteam Fusion
- ScriptBasic Cool because you could run it lightning fast on a certain web server without CGI overhead.  That is a really clever idea.  2010 update :( You know whats cute? Their tutorials are all in real audio format!  Its fast and has tons of features
- HBasic GPL and linux with forms for GUIs and using KDE Libraries.  Looks good
- Turbulenz, Looks polished and promising but theres no activity for 5 yrs
- Blender Game Engine
- pylove Dead
- Blitz3D, 	BASIC,	Win,			0,		1,		1,	9,		6,		0,		I've always thought this would be really cool
- AxisGFactory,Drag,	Win Mac Lin,	3,		2,		1,		Just for Terrains
- Power Game Factory.  This looks great ... the testimonials are glowing ... but it looks ancient too.   Nope it died in 2012 when Lion came out breaking their software :(  I'm honestly surprised I didnt know about this back then. I would have probably loved it, mac, 2d game creation, right up my alley tbh.  
- Tululoo Game Maker dead.  2013.
- [Scroller](http://percsich.hu/sgc/) Scroller Game Creator, download and add triggers and sprites and make a game really easily.  Broken no undo feature as of 2015.
- Axis Game Factory (Dead), $20 ($10 on steam) - Really a level design tool not a whole game engine.  Voxel Sculpt is $30 AGFProPremium is $80 and allows Multiplayer 8 player Simultaneous Design! Its a DLC on top of the $20 Rapid Level Development Toolset, website looks crappy, engine looks cool enough.  Its got a DLC called VoxelSculpt which looks fucking amazing!  I like how it lets you place start and end points for each level and also lets you add story elements.  Collaborate with Friends somehow (maybe just send them a .exe?).  Watching the prmotional video it looks a little clumsy and like coppercube in the sense that the features probably work but they also require that you do things a certain way and its a bit non standard and clunky for example I have no idea what their packaging exe feature was since distributing your software as an exe shouldnt really be a feature but totally a given.  OH!  its designed to work in concert with Unity.  "provide game developers and enthusiasts with a powerful and rapid level creation, terrain vegetation editing, lighting and atmosphere system."  Its got some cool DLC players like a first person shooter and a fantasy side scroller.  The DLC is cheaper on steam than on their website, but its all from 2013-2015 and the website implies that it takes some monkeying to get things working.  I can't imagine that the mac or linux versions even run.
- [Silent Walk FPS Creator](http://www.silentworks.hu/sw/editor.php) Maybe not technically dead still not appealing.  A doom or wolf editor would be better.  
- [Silent Walk Renaissance](http://www.silentworks.hu/swr/features.php) requires xp or 7 so its pretty ancient.    I suspect it was cool what they pulled off at the time though,  
- [Megakerma Maker](http://www.silentworks.hu/mk/features.php) a whole game engine by the same people.  Sort of amazing there was a small team in hungary doing this but its xp so ancient. 
- [Maratis](http://www.maratis3d.org/?page_id=57) died in 2013
- [Platinum Arts Sandbox](https://www.sandboxgamemaker.com/make-a-game-sandbox-faq/) Author still around but project is discontinued
- [Game Builder by Google](https://github.com/googlearchive/gamebuilder) looks like an experimental teaching tool with absolutely zero traction
- Mokoi - Dead in 2015.  Was probably great
- Reality Factory - Dead in 2015
- [Flixel](http://flixel.org/help.html) - This is powerful with lots of games made for it (Canabalt and the best of flash games from 2009 or so), however since its flash its just too old, there are apparently some other projects built on top of it that might be good.  Its got some unique features like moving thousands of objects and also debugging, and recording and replaying information (which is totally bad ass).  Tilemaps, Particles, Physics collisions.  Good thing I saw some little comment on slant that there are also ports, C# is dead, C is dead, Monkey X is dead, HaxeFlixel is ALIVE and Kicking!!
- Polycode (details in spreadsheet)
- Loom SDK (Purchased and dead in 2017)
- GDevApp (Site Gone)
- Crafty.js - Github not updated since 2018.  Forums still talking every few months.
- Haxepunk - last release 2018, they have touched it since but theres no momentum or community
- Spritekit - probably not actually dead but being an Apple product this is very different. Its not the same evaluation as the rest, nor would I believe for a second that it will be more accessible.  Obviously not cross platform either.  OTOH its probably fine for some since it might be the most battery efficient way to make an ios app.
- Flat Red Ball - Activity not actually dead, and there is a small discord so its def not dead, but the website doesn't funnel me in so I dont know why I would pick it in fact it seems based on old stuff and it seems confusing.  There are some demos and tuts on there though so its not terrible and I have nothing against it, but its not fresh enough for me.
- [Chiliworks](https://github.com/ChilliWorks/ChilliSource) its MIT and rumored to be mature but hasnt been touched in 3-4 years and the site is down
- [EasyRPG](https://easyrpg.org) Aiming for the RPGMaker 2000/2003 set of features theyre not close on the maker side.  Probably it will play those old games though. 
- [Fife](http://www.fifengine.net)	C++ Python			Late 90s PC games	Some work in Github	Forum dead  No community unfortunately
- Flare is a diablo engine dead since 2018
- [Fluxus](http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/documentation/) is an interesting livecoding video and audio language from 2010 where you run streams into it and they come out with AR on them.  Its too old and dead to use and too complicated to build, but I like where they are going and the pdf docs from 2010 have description of how really cool it was to use.
- HaxePunk	Haxe	Win Mac Lin	Win Lin Mac HTML5 iOS Android	Amiga Level games with a bit of 90s effects	Not too active on github, a few updates every 6 months or so.	Forum not hopping, Gitter over 1yr old chat, Discord points to the haxe one	Install Instructions seem out of date, 6 demos, 1 tutorial	Tilemaps particles mask collision, Tweens debug console	Free	1	Too Dead					
- Polycode	Lua C++	Win Mac Lin	Win Mac Lin	Dreamcast Looking Games	Bummer.  Nothing since 2015	None on the site	IDE uses Lua	Scenes, Lua for game logic, Materials, Shaders, Meshes, Skeletal Animation, Gamepads, Networking, In Game GUIs, 2D and 3D Collision & Physics	Free	1						
- Alice	http://www.alice.org/get-alice/#why	2	Make 3D Worlds c. 1999, Teach analytical programming thinking. Not for Production	Site unclear, Software Fresh, Forum Alive but slow, Lots of youtube 
- [Heritage](https://notabug.org/SylvieLorxu/HERITAGE) Text Adventure language, 2015 old, but I actually love the syntax.  Too bad.
- Inform - totally mature, heavily used, Problem: this is something people dont really talk about: There isn't anywhere to learn about this.  Nothing really works like you would expect it to work as a programmer so I bet it would be easier to use inform6 or tads, or for a non programmer to learn inform, I love the toolset and the ideas behind it, but if I want to make a relatively simple game I cant do it because there is so much that doesnt make sense and there are no examples.  The ones that are out there are either too complex or dont wokr anymore (thats common).  I'm probalby complaining too much but it has so much potential and has really pissed me off and made me feel stupid and frustrated.  Its really easy to read fortunately and makes for some beautiful code. a lso the maintainers care a lot about it.  I wonder what would happen if I tried again.
- Irrlicht - An old 2012 3d graphics engine that looks great and has lots of features and is mature but doesnt seem maintained.  I heard a lot about this in the past and thought about using it back in the 2000s.

- [OpenSludge](https://opensludge.github.io) Adventure Game language and kit but not updated in 2yrs even with a long history.  Also unfortunately their old forums shut down which is a great sad loss of information :( )  Looks like space quest with tons of graphics and art.  Pretty awesome!

# GUIs #


Visual tools for developing traditional desktop GUIs


To be fair lots or most of the IDEs and Languages have some level of GUI Builder associated or compatible.  I have mostly only listed the ones which have a sort of official one.  To be fair to the other side of the coin most of the third party or unofficial ones are not great in some way or sparsely supported.  Its kind of like when N64 had four player support built into the system and no one else did, it was the party game console because of it.  Other systems had a few 4+ player games but since you had to buy the extra piece it wasnt supported as well or as widely.  To be fair to those with third party GUI BUilders again, I suspect that for some 10% of the ones I haven't looked into they are really good and supported and even heavily used and Ive missed that.  Let me know if that is the case for your favorite IDE.

## 1. Investigate these for GUIS from code or GUI Builders










## 2. Investigate these newer fancier GUI solutions


- 


## 3. Investigate these No Code development Platforms
If I want to that is ... at least try out the free ones and see what gives


Expensive ones aka RAD aka No Code Development platforms aka low code development platforms

Note: Do any of these hold your app hostage if you dont pay?  Be careful to the terms on that account




- --------------------- Investigate These


# Programming on Mobile #

- PlayCanvas - This one is barely advertised to run on mobile but it should work really well and its cloud based so no storage required.

- AppGameKit literally RUNS on mobile.  Huge ding on what could be so great: it doesnt support BT Keyboards at least on IOS
- SmartBasic is my favorite.  It is really cool and can do a lot I spent a long time with it in bed as I fell asleep making cool graphics programs.  Its even got buttons and UI and stuff and its all documented in app.  It can send programs out to email I think so you can get them out of the app and you can always copy and paste them in and there may even be a better way to get them in.  Then you can even make your OWN APP on your phone from this using some kind of shortcut trick. its pretty awesome.  PLUS you can get a smart basic sdk for xcode and publish your iphone apps in the app store!  Thats pretty damn awesome if you ask me.   GPS, Multitouch, Networking, Music and Video, etc.  This is the one app that reminds me the most of AMOS for Amiga.  It says theres dropbox support and a forum to get answers.  thats awesome.  Update: It even works with bluetooth Keyboard!!!  One of the cool things about this and the other AIOs is how consistent everything is that works within the system.  you have to learn new commands and adapt in small ways you dont have to learn entirely new patterns or paradigms and you certainly dont have to add a bunch of boilerplate code.
- Codea 
- Construct 3
- Basic by miSoft - its a cool throwback, people say its best to dropbox your file and copy and paste it in
- Hotpaw basic like Chipmunk basic interpreter on iphone - not recently updated
- A few others on my old ipad

Programming on Mobile by typing in code and uploading it to a server
- Buffereditor
- Textastic
- Koder
- (there are actually a ton more)
- something Ive got on my phone for coding directly on my server
- Code Anywhere
- Anything that can put code on a server or on a 


Investigate: The smart basic SDK for xcode, I wonder if you can program in basic using that and run it on your mac easily?  its probably not interpreted so theres that but thats a pretty cool possible feature.



# Simple Starting Points #
1. AOZ.studio (see my [Amiga Page](Amiga.md) under AMOSPro for more)
2. OLCConsoleGameEngine [The intro video](https://youtu.be/u5BhrA8ED0o) all of the videos surrounding this video on his page use this engine and a windows console application to make games from nothing using just visual studio and this one dependency (well and iostream)  ALso he has a pixelgameengine that he uses later.
3. SmartBasic
4. AutoIT (GUI Builder) or AutoHotKey

Allegro 1 (could then port to Allegro 5)
Purebasic
AMOSPro or AmosProDark or X
Blitzbasic

## AMOSPro ##

From the Marc365 page: This repository is 68k Assembly and unique in design. It is powerful and runs like an operating system. Games and multimedia become exciting to program again, relying on your own skills instead of libraries.

Cool Facebook Group
https://www.facebook.com/groups/AmosPro
There you can get info about the latest source, find the AGA version, and ask questions from a supportive community.

Programming the Amiga installing AMOS the easy way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coOdEs4lJZ0
Here he shows how to get AMOS Pro running from the marc365 repo, also from amosforwindows, and then shows how to change startup sequence to fix paths so the amosforwindows can access the disks

Officially maintained Open Source Repo
https://github.com/marc365/AMOS-Professional-365
This is the official repo now for AMOS Pro Sources.  There are instructions on how to rebuild the whole program in the readme and there is an entire built verison in the /AMOS folder. I've had problems with line endings but once I converted line endings it worked.  If everything fails miserably thats probably the problem.  Someone said using the compiler that when the "Open default screen" in the Compiler Options is set to "No" (which is default) then even simple compiled programs crash. 
I hestitate to even mention this but I have heard of animosity between mark365 and other members of the AMOSPro community as of 2018 but I see no evidence of that at this point.
The compiler is here too but I dont think the examples disk is here

AMIDark - Fork with AGA and HAM8 support
https://github.com/AmiDARK/Amos-Professional-AGA-Releases
Here is the binary only AGA release which is hot and regularly updated.  Its also got HAM8 support recently.  Lots of support from the wizard author Frederic Cordier on the facebook group.
Heres the developer diary and official page of this fork http://amos-professional-aga.frederic-cordier.fr/?developer-diary

Offical Francois Lionet Version
This one is getting no maintenance but is forked from MARc365 and has official MIT license information.  This is important because it is from the original author and sets in stone the license terms which were for a time in 2019 in question and causing a huge political problem with the AGA release and any further substantial development.  I would say this will remain important but only for historical reasons.
https://github.com/AOZ-Studio/AMOS-Professional-Official
This is being maintained however as noted at the [top of this page](http://amos-professional-aga.frederic-cordier.fr)

Francois lionet's new project
https://www.aoz.studio
This is an AMOSPro compatible modern language which can then run in the browser which is pretty damn cool imho.  I believe it generates javascript.  It is supposed to retain compatiblity with old AMOS or AMOSPro programs.  Imho it wont be perfect but will be really good and there will be a certain skillset required to know what needs to change from old commands to the new language.  I hope I'm wrong.  certainly there are new superset commands making it easier to load modern graphics and sound resources.


Amos for Windows 2011
Heres an old 2011 version of AMOSPro running in an old pre-configured version of UAE which just boots quickly into AMOSPro.  Thats pretty cool and requires no setup.  If you want to setup an Amiga see Preconfigured Environments below.
http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=60144&fbclid=IwAR17q7fj3e6PhPT-MTU339anBeq1Fqj5uvjlm7U82Qp6JmSsvmFphq_xvks
It has all of the disks included including the examples disk and productivity disks
Also has some patches to get AMOS3D programs working which is unique and cool.  And there are some 3d examples. 
Also has the AMCAF extension which has faster math, adds and speeds up some graphics routines, adds fancy font support, and fixed protracker.


Resources:

- Aminet/amos
- [AMOS PD CDRom](https://archive.org/details/cdrom-amospdcd) - this is an interesting thing because there are thousands of programs on there, but in my experience virtually none of them work.  I'm sure they work using the right version of amos on the right OS, but I dont have that so it was frustrating to play with them.  OTOH since the source is there, a lot of learning could take place in just reading the source or trying to get them working and changing some things.

# Assembly #
## Assembly onModern Mac ##
This is actually pretty tricky to do assembly on modern systems unless you really know what you're doing.  

* I got a hello world going from [James Fishers tutorial](
https://jameshfisher.com/2017/02/20/macos-assembly-hello-world/) but then I saw this [nasm tutorial](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/) and was intrigued by the slight differences in the hello world code.  
* I think you could get a lot of information from these commands and operands lower down a bit in [this nasm tutorial](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/) it focuses on the details of the hardware and the most basic assembly commands and also has some mac specific details and a mac specific averaging program at the bottom that takes input and makes output.
* I heard earlier today that really assembly is about the details of the hardware as much as the language.  
* Samuel Evans-Powell figured out some things about [learning NASM on macOS](http://sevanspowell.net/posts/learning-nasm-on-macos.html) like about syscalls and the differences on mac and linux and also in that article he talks about linking c and assembly, and he talks about not absolute addressing on mac osx, and also about padding the stack frame.  It suggests using gcc to link instead of ld which lets you use the c standard library.  
* Here is a [Brainfuck Interpreter](https://www.kylem.net/programming/bf_interp.html) in x86-64 assembly
* Here are some 8086 programs that I can probably get running like I did with nasm on the mac above or with the boot sector approach

### Linking with a C Library ###
I wanted a super simple C Library so I'm going to [write one myself](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-make-your-own-libraries-in-C-programming).  I got it working and was able to call a super simple C library that I made (that just printfs the input number) from assembly.  It sends a number as a parameter but I dont understand the assembly enough yet to decide how to tell it to send an integer.  I got it sending a string (char *) through to the C code though and it worked great!


## Assembly on Modern Linux ##
* This [nasm tutorial](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/) seems really good and also has some mac and win specifics but is mostly linux specific.
* Running 

# Bare Metal #
* This guy [runs some programs on bare metal](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22054578/how-to-run-a-program-without-an-operating-system/32483545#32483545)


# C #
* [Freestanding C programs](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/01/31/) on windows.  this guy wrote some C programs for windows on linux with no external libraries or dependencies except operating System DLLs.  He also wrote some opengl style programs in tiny sizes for DOS (and he wrote those in linux too)

# Javascript

[A set of simple Javascript programs](https://github.com/NishiGaba/100-Basic-Javascript-Programs)

# Programming Training
Programming training comes in 1000 varieties so this section is for sites that are relatively general:

* [Study Tonight](https://www.studytonight.com/) offers study resources on a number of languages including tutorials & explanations, hundreds of [example programs](https://www.studytonight.com/c/programs/), [tests you can take](https://www.studytonight.com/tests/?/?subject=c) and [Interview Questions](https://www.studytonight.com/flashcards/Cpp/) to help you sharpen your skills.

# Game Development #
Unity, Unreal are the two big engines. Here are a few more intriguing ones:
1. [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/examples.html) (Straightforward C and OpenGL library with tons of language bindings and lots of capability)

# Makefiles #
[Super simple makefile](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/08/26/makefile-c-projects/)

# Folder Organization #
[Folder Structure by Infallible Code](https://youtu.be/F89PWIk7zec?t=328) It makes sense to keep scripts in scripts folder and textures in textures folder, but it also makes sense to organize conceptually or by object.  Searching lets you find things by name or type easily, but "You can't search by conceptual feature" like the laser dragon boss.  Plus things are often removed or replaced conceptually and delete a folder rather than finding things spread all over your product.  You can use tags too for categories and thats worth doing. 


# Flow charts flowcharts #

This is a language called [Flowgorithm](http://www.flowgorithm.org/download/index.htm) that lets you use simple pseudocode to plot out how your software or algorithms will work

There was something online I think called diagrammr where you would just type simple words on the right and it would make diagrams out of them

Free
yEd Live is free online and works great
Google Drawings is totally free
Draw.io is free
diagrameditor.com works for free

LOVE yEd is free downloadable for win mac lin - The usability is through the roof here even with touchpad.  Scrolling is clunky for some reason, and other parts of the GUI are clumsy.
Pencil is a free downloadable for making GUI Mockups and Diagrams

yUML - this one you just type on the left and it makes a diagram
DrawAnywhere
Sketchboard is free for public projects
This is code for making executable flowcharts with a free editor online

All of these have limited free plans
Cacoo
Gliffy
Creately has a good free plan
Canva



This cool software lets you make diagrams by typing reasonably simple commands its for programmers andit looks pretty great BUT Its $15/mo if you wan to use any of the powerful features or make too big of a diagram.  Still worth checking out 
https://www.gleek.io/


# BASIC #
See my [Amiga Page](Amiga.md) for lots of BASIC

- [Learn BASIC Online](http://www.runbasic.com/seaside/go/runbasic?_s=zmRffWJWpHSEWXSS&_k=zCNyUHwT) with RUNBasic by Libertybasic.  

Learn basic programming by example a 2d game pt 1 is a great intro to purebasic making a game and by 11:20 he has a lot of the boilerplate out of the way so just that one page of code is a great starting point

## Chipmunk Basic ##
- Chipmunk Basic 9/15/2020 for mac is a simple basic interpreter.  It doesnt work like an IDE or a text editor but it works like having a commodore 64 or apple II in this window.  You can load basic programs which dont require line numbers with load "filename" but they have to be in your documents folder for some reason or you can specify the path directly.  A little softlink fixes that problem.  This is so great! It took me right back in time and let me play a game I typed in a few years ago ACEYDUCEY from the book 101 BASIC Computer games.  I think I typed it in anway ... 
9/15/2020 Ive had fun with it.  Its a great way to learn how things used to work back in the day.  I bought a bt mechanical keyboard so I could type some of these old programs in.
ACEY DUCEY from 1010 Basic Computer Games works perfectly as downloaded.  I wonder if the others do too?

# LUA #

Heres a way to compile lua into a GUI executable.  You can even possibly make it self modify its own code!
