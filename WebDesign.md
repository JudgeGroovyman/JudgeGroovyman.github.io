* Ash made [his site](https://ash.ms/) look and behave like windows 95 and in a tiny super fast footprint
* @paul_v_m made [his site](http://paulvm.com/) look like a 90s website with flashing effects and crappy colors and under construction signs dancing pizza animations and all.

# Blog Frameworks #
Apart from wordpress and medium I've been recently intrigued by static site generators that take your markdown files (such as this website) and process them into a full website.  github is doing that for me here (It uses Jeckyll) but here are some other options:

[A cool discussion of hosting for JAMStack ](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19982918)

[Headless CMS](https://headlesscms.org) use with [Static Site Generators](https://www.staticgen.com) this is fundamental to the [JamStack](https://jamstack.org) 
"Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers."

best name that cristi invented Optimule.com (available)

"this time around I've added the requirement that this new stack MUST remove as many barriers to writing and publishing as possible and make it as pain free (maybe even fun) as possible." [josebrowne](https://josebrowne.com/tutorial-static-blog-using-headless-ghost-2-0-gatsby-netlify/) 

## Feel Best for Me and or Cristi:

1. [Local Ghost + Gatsby + Netlify + Cloudinary](https://josebrowne.com/tutorial-static-blog-using-headless-ghost-2-0-gatsby-netlify/) this is a great and safe and secure and super fast and free option.
