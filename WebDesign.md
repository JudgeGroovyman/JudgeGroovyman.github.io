* Ash made [his site](https://ash.ms/) look and behave like windows 95 and in a tiny super fast footprint
* @paul_v_m made [his site](http://paulvm.com/) look like a 90s website with flashing effects and crappy colors and under construction signs dancing pizza animations and all.

# Blog Frameworks #
Apart from wordpress and medium I've been recently intrigued by static site generators that take your markdown files (such as this website) and process them into a full website.  github is doing that for me here (It uses Jeckyll) but here are some other options:


[Headless CMS](https://headlesscms.org) use with [Static Site Generators](https://www.staticgen.com) this is fundamental to the [JamStack](https://jamstack.org) 
"Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers."

3. [Anchor](https://anchorcms.com) Open Source Free CMS.  Super lightweight.  Is there a wysiwyg editor or is it all markdown? At least in 2015 WYSIWYG was possible with one of several addons.  Could we get a markdown editor for Cristis phone and mac?

Revision History UPDATE: damnit  Last github update was 2018.   	[Installing PostLeaf On Digital Ocean](https://www.postleaf.org/installing-postleaf-on-digitalocean) $5/mo and quite a process!
1. [Bolt](https://bolt.cm)	 Free Forever	 Summary: "Easy for editors, and a developer's dream CMS. Bolt is an open source Content Management Tool, which strives to be as simple and straightforward as possible. It is quick to set up, easy to configure, uses elegant templates, and above all: Itâ€™s a joy to use."  There is a slack. 	Features: extensive tags for taxonomies.

I dont know but that might be enough ... otoh it says its got hard limits so it will just shut you down if you hit those limits.  You know what though ... If we are talking headless CMS that should be ok.  We still have our site and files on our end so that might work just fine.  If we can switch to another CMS anytime then that will be just fine.

## Feel Good and Worth Experimenting
1. [Listed](https://listed.to) (0/10/50/150) Super Simple Public Journal. Use [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org) to make your blog but that costs 10/mo or 50/yr or 150/5yrs. Paywalls and donations builtin.  Listed comes with an editor or you can use markdown.  They even have a Longevity Statement.  Except that we might have to pay more (since I've already got a web server) I really like this option.  #TryThis This is such a cool simple possibility for a blog.
2. [Strikingly](https://www.strikingly.com) (0/8/16/49/mo) "Within an hour we had the best landing page yet and for a fraction of the price." You can sell one product per site, and you can make unlimited free sites.  They are branded with an ad for strikingly but otherwise totally free.   Simplicity and Style.  Signups, forms, live chats, newsletters all built in (so they claim)  use your domain name if you pay.  Full ecommerce functionality.  Analytics built in.  Password protection.  #TryThis #LandingPage #AmazonAffiliate
3. [Site123](https://www.site123.com)  (0/12/mo) "By far the easiest website builder" Free for a subdomain. 
4. [Hubpages](https://hubpages.com) Start blogging instantly.  I think there are ads.  There is no customization at all but maybe thats ok.  "Hubpages majors on its ability to connect its users with a wide audience and earn revenue from ads and affiliates"   #TryThis #LandingPage #AmazonAffiliate
5. [Penzu](https://penzu.com) Free Military Grade Encrypted Private Journal for your own private thoughts online from mobile or PC.  Save to PDF. Share to the world if they have the link ... wonder if they are indexed by google?  Share to individuals with penzu account. 
 


## Dont feel quite right
5. [Ghost](https://ghost.org) 	Open Source Headless CMS "Publish Online and Deliver Newsletters to their audience"	Super easy to install on PC to try it out locally.  Super difficult to install on a picky Ubuntu linux server.  I have no interest in a complicated install but at least its free.  I was wondering if I could use it on my PC or laptop local and use it to publish to a folder that was a local git instance and then push when I'm ready and then go over to the Static Site Generator and do a build (or nightlies or something) 	Update: Node.js require a VPS or dedicated server so thats right out!  Maybe on DigitalOcean though for just $5/mo
3. [Typo3](https://typo3.org) Open Source, People have some bad impressions of this
6. [Ghost Hosting](https://ghost.org) $29/mo with a beautiful powerful editor.  No free plan. Increased performance, SEO is better, fewer problems with the site.
7. [Wix](http://wix.com)
8. [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com)
9. [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/pricing/) (0/489/mo) Pretty complicated in ways that I dont think it needs to be but awesome because the content is completely separate from the design.  Free plan could be pretty useful though.  
10. [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com) 
11. [Medium](https://medium.com) 
12. [Blogger](http://blogger.com) 
 - ----Cool though Expensive Headless CMSs----------

2. [Bold](https://www.g2.com/products/quintype-bold/reviews) 99 Separates content from presentation enabling new opportunities.  
3. [Mura](https://www.g2.com/products/mura/pricing) PRices Not Listed :( "mura was designed to deliver agile and elegant digital experiencesâ€”fast. For content authors, marketers, and developers, we put the power in your hands"
 
 
 
Note:
1. Maybe for every article on the blog publish another similar article on Hubpages.  
2. Maybe theres a way to make wordpress lightning fast?
