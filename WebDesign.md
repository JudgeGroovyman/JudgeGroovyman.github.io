# Jekyll #

- To debug my githubpages (where this is hosted) I had to follow [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) to install jekyll (easy per documentation no issues)
- Then when Jekyll was installed I did  ``jekyll new jekylltest --force`` and could have done that in my judgegroovyman.github.io folder instead of jekylltest because apparently it only overwrites jekyll files
- I accidentally installed Jeckyll too haha
- then ``bundle exec jekyll serve`` seems to serve a site and then I can go to the .md file but its not interpreted into html :(
- it doesnt show any errors either
- livereload doesnt work ``--livereload`` at the end 
- it seems like it copied all of the .md files over but I dont see any 
- Interesting this claims each of my files might need a yaml front matter section at the top.  They dont for github pages so ...
- Ok on Github it says I might have to [edit a gem file](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
- in that gemfile it says to run ``bundle update github-pages`` after I've done that but that doesnt work. ``Could not find gem 'github-pages'.``
-  some googling suggests trying ``bundle update jekyll`` and then ``bundle install`` and yeah!  that seemed to work 
- AND it has an error which will let me figure out what to do about my site!! bingo!
- well kind of bingo.  it says games.md is the problem and it says its because there are some invalid non-utf-8 characters, but it doesnt say what they are or what line or anything
- after 3 failed experiments I ended up in notepad++ Encoding menu -> Convert to ANSI and then Convert to UTF-8.  


# Cool uses and abuses of web design #
* Ash made [his site](https://ash.ms/) look and behave like windows 95 and in a tiny super fast footprint
* @paul_v_m made [his site](http://paulvm.com/) look like a 90s website with flashing effects and crappy colors and under construction signs dancing pizza animations and all.

# Blog Frameworks #
Apart from wordpress and medium I've been recently intrigued by static site generators that take your markdown files (such as this website) and process them into a full website.  github is doing that for me here (It uses Jeckyll) but here are some other options:

* [A cool discussion of hosting for JAMStack ](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19982918)
* [Jamstack Virtual Conference Oct 2020](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL58Wk5g77lF94tg-F3y5zRyDeLVhTDnTg)
* [Headless CMS](https://headlesscms.org) use with [Static Site Generators](https://www.staticgen.com) this is fundamental to the [JamStack](https://jamstack.org) 
* "Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers."

"this time around I've added the requirement that this new stack MUST remove as many barriers to writing and publishing as possible and make it as pain free (maybe even fun) as possible." [josebrowne](https://josebrowne.com/tutorial-static-blog-using-headless-ghost-2-0-gatsby-netlify/)

29. [Lepton](https://lepton-cms.org/english/home.php) 	German.  Great Server precheck feature (which all of these should have 100%).  Great two factor authentication feature.  Not enough other clear features to make it appealing. 	21MB #inmotion	
28. [Plikki](https://plikli.com)	This one is sad it was made by one expert guy who literally yesterday wrote a sad letter saying he wasnt going to be able to release his new version of his software because of the 138 installs of his old software (where everyone agreed to leave the ads.txt installed so he would make tiny amounts of money) only 7 people left that in place.   #inmotion
27. [Pluck](https://github.com/pluck-cms/pluck) 	Theres no website for this website software haha.  It might be great but theres no way to know.  	5MB #inmotion

23. [Pluxml](https://www.pluxml.org)	XML Flat File but its all in French so its not really reliably usable for english speakers.  No resentment here though every language deserves a great flat file blog!	3.17MB #Flat #Inmotion

5. [Ghost](https://ghost.org) 	Open Source Headless CMS "Publish Online and Deliver Newsletters to their audience"	Super easy to install on PC to try it out locally.  Super difficult to install on a picky Ubuntu linux server.  I have no interest in a complicated install but at least its free.  I was wondering if I could use it on my PC or laptop local and use it to publish to a folder that was a local git instance and then push when I'm ready and then go over to the Static Site Generator and do a build (or nightlies or something) 	Update: Node.js require a VPS or dedicated server so thats right out!  Maybe on DigitalOcean though for just $5/mo

8. [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com)
9. [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/pricing/) (0/489/mo) Pretty complicated in ways that I dont think it needs to be but awesome because the content is completely separate from the design.  Free plan could be pretty useful though.

Using Inmotion
1. I figured out how to transfer a domain over to inmotion  It was a process and you have to own the email that the domain is registered with or I dont think you can even do it.  It takes many steps
