* Ash made [his site](https://ash.ms/) look and behave like windows 95 and in a tiny super fast footprint
* @paul_v_m made [his site](http://paulvm.com/) look like a 90s website with flashing effects and crappy colors and under construction signs dancing pizza animations and all.

# Blog Frameworks #
Apart from wordpress and medium I've been recently intrigued by static site generators that take your markdown files (such as this website) and process them into a full website.  github is doing that for me here (It uses Jeckyll) but here are some other options:
1. [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)
2. A comparison of [Gatsby vs Jeckyll vs Hugo](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/features/jamstack/gatsby-vs-jekyll-vs-hugo) which is on the gatsby site so it might be biased but still.
