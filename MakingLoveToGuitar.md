# Making Love to your guitar #
There is a subtle sickness in guitar communities (web and real world) that suggests that there are only three legitimate uses for guitar: Studio and Live.  Any other uses of the guitar seem to get lumped in with the pejorative 'practicing' (or worse 'noodling') at which noses are turned up and glasses are pushed down.  Practicing is important for technique but is considered a second class citizen only valuable for getting you to the point where you can use the guitar in one of its two 'real' and 'legitimate' settings: Studio or Live.

Playing on your own for your own purposes is not considered a first class thing to do. It is looked down upon and while theres nothing wrong with practicing or noodling if these things are not used as stepping stones to get to the studio or live environments, then they are even further marginalized as a 'hobby'.  But what if you want to play by yourself? What if you want to make your own live music just for you?  What if you want to play along with your favorite songs because its fun as hell?  What if you want to make new original live music by improvising with backing tracks because you love doing it?  What if strumming the same chord for 6 straight hours brings you joy?  What if you want to play on your own for any other reason?  What if you just want to be alone with your guitar?  What if you want to touch it and play with it and sort of make love to it?  

These are the things I call 'making love to your guitar'.  There is no reason why these things should not be a legitimate use of your instrument to create more joy in your world.  There is no reason why these things should not be a 'first class citizen' reason to play guitar.  

 In some sense some of these guitar activities could be considered a 'hobby' but calling anything a hobby makes it seem unimportant and in this case thats not accurate enough to be a valuable label.  Making love to your guitar is more than a hobby.  It is an investment in yourself and your connection with your instrument and your joy.

Who says that you are not important enough to attend a concert of one?  Who says that the VIP seats to the show you are putting on tonight shouldn't be reserved for YOU?
 
# The Making Love to Your Guitar Blog # 

Does making love to your guitar strike a chord with you (guitar pun intended)?  Are you the sort of person that does any of the activities listed there?  Are you the sort of person who wants to?  Are you the sort of person who gets joy out of playing the guitar on your own?  If you answered yes to any of the above then this blog is specifically for you. Lots of products ( amps, pedals) and blogs, and youtube channels, focus on gear, tone, tech, and techniques, and this one will too but here we slice the problem against the grain.
 
This blog is primarily for people who want to play guitar at home.  More specifically this will focus on unusual solutions to the practical problems that normal people face when playing guitar by yourself for any reason and many of these practical issues arise due to having families, roommates, and neighbors, living rooms, apartments, condos, and are often related to volume.  Mad Science will be involved as often as possible.  Whether you want to make love to your guitar alone (see above) or practice or noodle or record at home this blog will help with all of those things.

NO: This blog isn't too terribly focused on playing live gigs (small or large).  Playing live isn't having an intimate love making moment alone with your guitar but instead we're all swinging.  In all seriousness theres nothing wrong with swinging or playing live this just isnt the place.  It wont be substantially covered here and the focus of this space will be on making things work at home.

P.S. If after reading all of this you still look down upon this and judge playing on your own for the purposes listed above to be unimportant and a 'second class citizen' thing to do with the guitar then you are officially a snob and we are unlikely to get along about this topic.  (Also: I fart in your general direction.)

# The need for tone #
I suspect that in some critical cases in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, the biggest difference between the person who got the record deal and the one who didnt is their learning environment:
1. Could they play all the time
2. Could they play loud
3. Could they play loud enough to get good tone
4. Could they play loud enough that their mistakes were evident
5. Were they encouraged and supported to play live shows (people taking them, helping pay for gear and travel, congratulating them, coming to shows, etc.)
6. Could they afford the gear that would get them good tone
7. Did they have access to information about what gear got good tone
8. Did they have access to information about what gear got the tones they wanted for their style (pedals, tube amps, guitar types)
9. Was their gear maintained well? (guitar setup, tubes maintained)
10. Was the first guitar they ever got setup well so it wasn't a battle just to play it?
11. If they needed to use headphones to play guitar were they decent headphones?

While an extremely motivated player could overcome most or all of these potential roadblocks, there are so many factors that could discourage a would-be guitar god and I bet there are hundreds of people who, if they had lucked into the right gear or the right level of support could have become important players and I bet there are a few great players of today who had they not lucked into the right gear early on or not gotten the support they needed, would have given up or not pushed forward as much and wouldn't be important today.  It could be as simple as their parents going to the music store and picking between two guitars where if they pick the strat on the right it happens to be easy to play and the pickups sound better, and if they happen to pick the one on the left its harder to play (becoming a struggle to get good sounds out of), and the pickups don't sound as good so its not as inherently motivating to play guitar.  Those are the kind of things which if they happen at a critical moment could make all the difference.  

If you were lucky enough to get a guitar amp in the 60s it was probably a decent tube amp by todays standards.  Sometime in the late 70s or 80s solid state started showing up and some of them killed peoples tones.  There are of course advantages which are just recently being truly realized for the most part since now a lot of solid state tech can sound wonderful and feel responsive.
