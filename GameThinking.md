CHORE GAMES 12/5/2020
----------------------------------------------------
Games that seem or feel like a chore in some or any way but I still have good reason to play them, Play all of these games with step by step walkthroughs or cheats, Dont know how to list Zelda games: Use Walkthroughs, Use Cheats, etc.  Other games that seem like a chore, Games I will probably never finish: Spiderweb games that I started, MetroidPrime, I dont think I trust zelda and metroid games to not put things in places way out of the box of my brain and things like that dont please me honestly  I also dont trust them to not put me into situations that are too hard for me to handle.  Boss battles every so often should take many tries thats fine.  

- Small PracticeBurdens: Contra, NinjaGaiden, Castlevania, ShinobiIII, Sonic 1 3DS, Volgarr, SwordofSodan
- Retroachievements: Zelda2,
- 3DSen Zelda2, 
- Wii/GC Stereoscopic: TwilightPrincess, WindWaker
- Stereoscopic 3DS: Ocarina
- Would love to play Suikoden again with cheats to make it easy, also FF7 and Alundra and ParasiteEve and the like
- CastlevaniaGBA(Cheats), 
- Shantae, Same with Shantae games although I love them so much 
- Achievements: Volgarr the Viking	
- Long VR RPG
	- VanishingRealmsVR, SkyrimVR, SubnauticaVR, GTA5VR, EliteDangerousEpic, Minecraft, 
- Sports:
	- Amiga: The fact is about these I'm going to suck for a long time. GOAL!, SensibleSoccer, KickOff2, But I would love to get to the point where I could beat the computer reliably in goal on every level, but thats a big goal for starters Id like to beat the computer reliably on even the EASY level!  That would actually be a really fun goal and would let me feel really good about it.
	- Championship Baseball - I would love to get good enough to take my 1989 cubs to the world series in this specific game
	- C MLB Power Pros Wii
- Stereoscopic 3DS: MetroidSamusReturns(15h), 
- Save Scum then play again and scum less and again and scum less
Apidya and rtype 2 and dragon spirit or the other dragon game from the 30 jealous amiga games and banshee
I like the idea of playing these save scumming every few seconds, and then playing again save scumming less and retrying more and playing again save scumming less and retrying more and so on
