* [8 Bit Show and Tell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3gRBswFkuteshdwMZAQafQ) he has a great style where he shows everything with his hands and always has some cool retro props in the frame.  Hes really savvy about 8 bit commodores and shows some great assembly and cool hardware cartridges and stuff.  One of my favorites was when he had a guest on and they [showed the C64 game Invader](https://youtu.be/SJ81YD9Ebec) that they made in assembly and went through how the code worked. 


# C64 Assembler #
After giving up trying to run the C64 emulator on AmigaOS4 (which was a fun idea and shouldn't have been that big of a deal tbh) (see Amiga.md for more) I am doing it on winVice now and its going smooth.  it types fast, loads decently fast, etc.  The keys are mapped intelligently (Although I dont know how petscii would work on here).  Ok it was really hard to find the back arrow key which is top left of c64 keyboard.  I didnt find anything on the web telling me (not saying its not out there somewhere) but I got a clue and tried some of the insert block of keys and it was the end key.  Then to kill the program I hit run/stop and Restore at the same time (which was esc and pgup) then I typed sys 32768 again and it opened the assembler with my program still loaded!
