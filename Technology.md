## Really Interesting ##
1. Teslas [Wireless Energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMJr-oUYYDA) demonstration. I loved this one.  This seemed like magic.

### Nuclear ###
All of these talks have to prep people to understand that there is no danger from a properly made fusion made reactor.  
1. Prodigy has a plan for [safe small factory produced fission reactors](https://youtu.be/5HL1BEC024g) another talk on the [same topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB93E-C7OPo)  they are walkaway safe.
2. This guy says [the energy crisis is over](https://youtu.be/jDqCpfVwdP4) because we can make factories to run off of the Thorium in dirt and a cubic yard of dirt can power my energy needs for my whole life. He also talks about using saltwater.  Of course its not over because politically thats near impossible atm but I get the point. "Liquid flouride thorium reactor" is walkaway safe.  "Why are we still talking about nuclear in the same way we were talking about in the 1960s" a penny a day per person. Every country has thorium reserves its abundant. 


## Pretty Good ##
1. Some clever power efficiency technology with volts and EMF in the second section.  [Old Alternative Energy guy shows cool tech](https://youtu.be/HK3JOlY0V8Y)  Comments indicate that this is good science with a misleading title.
