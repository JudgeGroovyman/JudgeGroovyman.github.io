Well it works but recording is a problem but there are a bunch of threads showing that in Catalina you have to run it  from the terminal

I was able to record with it when I launched it from the terminal.  It sure seems like its running slowly tho

Perhaps its not an issue with the latest version when using the [provided instructions](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/mac/)
