# External Keyboard
### Home and End buttons
A [Five minute fix](https://www.maketecheasier.com/fix-home-end-button-for-external-keyboard-mac/) for the home and end buttons

# Sidecar #
Lots of reports of it freezing after 30min. Mine freezes after 1-5min.
Possible workarounds:
1. reset it by Hide and unhide sidebar
2. Possibly fixed (Cross fingies) by either leaving the sidebar on and or turning off screen rotation Update: 1h later this is still going strong.  Ok after like 90 min it locked up again
3. Rumors say usign cable is more reliable it wasnt for me
4. Rumors say you can do some kind of underlying data reset in your mac account to help. 

Next Steps: Try using a brand new account with it for a little while. if it works perfeclty for hours wiht a brand new account then I know its something in my account.

Interesting side effect: Netflix wont run if you have sidecar enabled.  its black even on your main screen.  Theory: It detects something like some kind of screen copy software that streams the display over and goes black to prevent piracy.  Workaround: Chrome works.  Safari doesnt work.  Chrome must sense those things differently.

Well it works but recording is a problem but there are a bunch of threads showing that in Catalina you have to run it  from the terminal

I was able to record with it when I launched it from the terminal.  It sure seems like its running slowly tho

Perhaps its not an issue with the latest version when using the [provided instructions](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/mac/)
