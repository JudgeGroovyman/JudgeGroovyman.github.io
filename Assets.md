# Scripting #

## Runtime ##
I love the idea of having game logic able to be changed during runtime with no ill effects.
Possibly one of these would do the trick
* [Freedom Script](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/freedom-script-67440) or [Freedom Script Demo](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/freedom-script-demo-68621)
* [Moddable](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/moddable-29573)
* [Miniscript](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/miniscript-87926) voted as the least intimidating programming language


## Visual Scripting ##
* [Panda BT Free](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/ai/panda-bt-free-33057)  $0 Text based (the pro version is $30 and has an inspector drag and drop editor) but apparently works fairly well.
* [AI Machine](
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/ai/ai-machine-aim-visual-programming-and-ai-122906) $10 No.  This looks like a great visual scripting solution but there are no reviews.  It was updated earlier this year.  Not until there are reviews or a detailed how to on youtube.
* [Behavior Bricks](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/behavior-bricks-74816) $0  No because reviews indicate shitty documentation lots of bugs and spotty support


# Event System #

There is a system called [$0 Event Delegate System](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/event-delegate-system-68785) that looks really good.

# Music #

* [Chuck for Unity](http://chuck.stanford.edu/chunity/) is a music programming language and synthesizer right inside Unity
* [Procedural Music Generator](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/orchestral/procedural-music-generator-99791) 

with many styles available and a desktop demo to see what it can do.  Its pretty cool honestly but its a bit tricky to figure out how to make it sound consistent.  For the style presets it has though you could just hit go and it would be perfect.

# Meshes #

### Mesh Face Optimization ###
[Mesh Face Optimization](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/mesh-face-optimization-99412?q=mesh%20face%20optimization&orderBy=0)
This is for when you have combined primatives or other meshes to make bigger more interesting meshes and want to optimize them.  If you combine  meshes then they sit on top of and inside one another and this looks at that combined mesh and removes the invisible faces.

### Mesh Explosion ###
$20 Blast apart a mesh into its triangles
Level 2 (specific usefulness, great support)
updated last month released in 2012

it doesnt blast apart into different meshes but just into consituent triangles, but still it looks great!  You can even use a physics mode for each triangle with colliders and everything.
### Mesh Baker ###
$65  Combine skinned meshes and materials to reduce draw calls
Level 1(Great Usefulness, great support)

Fixes models and creates atlases so many meshes can share materials for static dynamic batching.  You run a report to see what objects are using what shaders and then make a mesh baker object for each shader, then assign each mesh to the mesh baker object for that shader.

It would be cool to make a #benchmark with this asset

Updated last month.  5 stars with 92 reviews.

### Mesh Slicer ###
$70 Slice Meshes, very performant
Level 2 (Specific usefulness, great support)

If slicing meshes is what you need then this seems to be a great asset. Reviews say its fast even on large meshes, it seems to add a texture to the inside of the mesh and also make mesh colliders out of the sliced sections.

#### Alternatives ####
I have a feeling that none of these are as performant as this asset
- I have something called fracturing and destruction (unfortunately deprecated but replaced by advanced tools megapack which is also out of date) that lets you do something related though not quite the same.  
- [EZY-Slice](https://github.com/DavidArayan/ezy-slice) is an MIT open source option 
- [Blinded Am Me](https://github.com/BLINDED-AM-ME/UnityAssets) is an open source option Here's a [video about the code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgoUmrhXyYE) and [another which uses the code extensively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL2JVgnit_c).  It was updated just a few months ago.
- [Turbo Slicer 2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/turbo-slicer-2-73236) $60 All of these seem to be 2 years old!?!
- [Go Shatter Toolkit](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/go-shatter-toolkit-1017) $80 Two years old, doesnt shatter skinned meshes.

### Mesh Animator ###
$25 4-100x as many animated skinned meshes with this script
Level 1 (Great usefulness, great support)

It has a demo of thousands of uniquely animated meshes - theyre all the same skinned mesh but they are animated and move uniquely.

First released in 2014 its latest update was June 2019 so its really been kept up to date well. 

#### Some Quotes ####
- "Support for this asset is the best I have ever received"
- Really can get 10k units working on 970 class hardware
- "This asset increased my game's performance by 100x, seriously and literally."

### Mesh Creation and Decimation ###
Here are some of my own videos about this:
- [Low Poly Mesh from Pixel Art](https://youtu.be/kBVVXhdAQ5A)
- [Generating a 2.5d platformer level](https://youtu.be/6n9lCmTXtUA)
- [Making a platformer level from a picture](https://youtu.be/wEc3nc9n6mQ)
Also there are some great videos about making low poly objects like:
- [Making Low Poly Animals](https://youtu.be/JjW6r10Mlqs)

### MeshKit ###
$69
1. An easy to use in-unity decimator.  
2. An automatic LOD builder.
3. More

This is a really professional asset and has great tutorials and introduction videos and a really nice in-unity interface.
The decimator clearly works on high poly objects, and lowers a 250k mesh down to 60 with no visible changes.  I wonder how well it works on lower poly objects.

Unity Forum Post:
https://forum.unity.com/threads/meshkit-3d-editing-optimisation-and-asset-management-plugin.322637/


### Mesh Deformer ###

Current (Released March 2019) is compatible with 2018.3 (which is what I'm using atm)
Its mature and really cool.  You just take any mesh that you want to be a segment of something longer, then you make it 'rigid' then 'append' and use its spline editor to roughly position the next segment, and so on and so forth.  Eventually you click 'loop' if you want it to make a seamless loop, and then you click 'set mirrored mode' and it fills in the gaps and makes it all real smooth!

For a few things it seems to work really well such as making tracks like in the original video and for making curved walls for a castle boundary that would be great, easily changing the pivot on a mesh, and subtly bending meshes to make things more interesting, however I spent several hours with it tonight (7/4/2019) and I couldn't figure out a way to deeply and consistently leverage it for my purposes.  I feel like it has promise for me and plan to keep it in mind.

It has great reviews (the only bad review is someone who sent an email to the wrong address) and like I said before its really useful for some things so this is a very good asset.

1. Super simple mesh combination
2. Deforming meshes (making them bendy)
3. Modify Pivots
4. Apparently it can subdivide too

If you do something wrong there are lots of console errors about the GUI but they don't affect functionality.  

### Fracturing & Destruction ###
I bought this last November for $30 but its not available anymore.  Soon after 
I bought it it was deprecated and replaced by [a different package](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/advanced-tools-mega-pack-43671) 

This works very well actually.  It pretty easily lets you explode a mesh and lets the parts fall on the ground.  Its pretty awesome!  I've used this quite a bit in my best VR game.

Since on the Unity Asset Store its deprecated, here's some info about the package [from their website](http://www.ultimategametools.com/products/fracturing)
They've got an overview, help, scripting, and an FAQ on that site.

It looks like of all of the tools in the Advanced Tools Mega Pack this is the only one that has been deprecated on the Asset store.
#### My Feelings about the package ####
The replacement for this deprecated package costs 6 times as much as I paid.  It also includes the Automatic LOD tool that I also already bought and when you add up what I've spent previously I am just a few bucks shy of what this costs but I don't get support for my old package.  This leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

### Advanced Tools Mega Pack ###
This is $180 and includes a number of tools: 
1. Fracturing & Destruction (which I already bought for half off of $60)
2. Ultimate Rope Editor (which I don't think I care about)
3. Concave Collider (which looks cool but I don't completely understand)
4. Mesh Combiner (which I already have several of)
5. Automatic LOD (which I already bought for half off of $90)
6. Mesh Simplify (which apparently comes included in F&D above)

Oddly the latest reviews seem identical to the Automatic LOD pack.  I'm not sure why that is.  The reviews on the rope editor are different.  Some of the reviews of the Mesh Simplify tool are the same.

A common theme in the reviews is that the developer isn't providing support. That is so disappointing especially on a package that is $180.  The latest version of the whole $180 package was released on August 10 2017 which as of today is 23 months ago (almost two years).   I emailed them on July 6 2019 and will be interested to see if and when they reply.

They have a [website](http://www.ultimategametools.com/products/advanced_tools_mega_pack)

The Concave Collider looks pretty awesome actually.  It allows for complex colliders instead of having convex colliders which provide a really rough and imprecise solution.  The [video on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=6&v=mu__FxT8Gzk) explains it pretty well. 

## Investigate ##
- Concave Collider (in advanced tools mega pack)


## Just Ok ##

### Scene OBJ Exporter ###

Free ( Nov 2018 )
Seems to export all of the meshes in your entire scene into one OBJ
[Scene Object Exporter](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/scene-obj-exporter-22250)

### FBX Exporter ###
Free (Nov 2018)
The latest version of this is available via the package manager from Unity 2018.3+
Its supposed to setup a round trip workflow between Unity and your Modeling software.

### Meshinator ###

Free (I own this)
Real time mesh deformation
This one deforms the mesh based on physics calculations
[Meshinator](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/meshinator-realtime-mesh-deformation-8228)

It can smoosh spheres and make crystals break and shatter
Last release was in 2015 so I don't know how well it will work now.

### Automatic LOD ###
$90 (Purchased Nov 27 2018)
If I'm being honest this asset makes me mad.  I remember buying it last fall when it was on sale at the time I was thinking it would help me make my games less resource intensive.  I also felt at the time like I really needed it so I didnt have to do all of the LOD on my own.  Although certainly doing that on my own would take longer, and an automatic solution is a godo plan, I'm feeling a little taken advantage of.  The asset called MeshKit is less money (not too much more than I paid when this was on sale) and has this feature and many more.  This one has (since I bought it) been somewhat abandoned.  There are reports in the reviews of it not working with recent Unity versions and the publishers not responding to requests for support.  Other reports of it just not doing a good job. Others saying the extra LODs takes up a lot of space.  Others say it messes up the skins on decimated models.  Others say it works but doesnt do any batching.  That parts ok I guess.  They both have good video documentation.  I of course am responsible for having bought it but I regret it now and wish I had bought the other one.  I also suspect I can get this feature for cheaper in some other asset that I don't even know about yet.  I just have a bad taste in my mouth at the moment.  On the bright side maybe when I get to the point where I might need it I will love it.  

## Not Recommended ##

### Mesh Toolkit ###
AKA Mesh TK
$10 (Purchased Dec 8 2017)
This lets you manipulate meshes in some pretty advanced ways and vertices and save them as new OBJ or FBX assets and lets you set pivots and remove unused vertices and much more.  It could be a little like having a basic blender in Unity.

The video shows the features of selecting triangles and faces, extruding, subdividing, deleting, flipping (faces I think), selecting by face, selecting with a click and paint, selecting multiple faces.  You can make those changes and then save them back to the files in the scene or you could export them to mnew objects.

I couldn't get it to do anything at all in Unity 2018.3.4f1  Further the authors website is entirely dead.  I can't imagine this is ever going to work or get any support.  The last update was 2015, there is no longer a support or documentation website since those links are now entirely down.  Other people (in reviews) are reporting that it doesn’t work for them in Unity 2018 either.  
Recommendation:  Supported Unity versions on the asset store say 4.0 or later however I think thats no longer accurate and needs to be changed to 4.0 through Unity 2017.


# Procedural Generation Toolkit #

The [Procedural Generation Toolkit](https://github.com/Syomus/ProceduralToolkit) seems to do some things that make procedural generation more pleasant.  Looped arrays (so you can just keep adding 1 to the index I presume), Color gradients, and colors in HSV 

## Investigate ##

# Level Design #
* [MonKey](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/monkey-editor-commands-productivity-booster-119938) seems to have some effective level design shortcuts built in.  its regularly updated and is made by game devs who are using it day to day so I have a good feeling about this.
