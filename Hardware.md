In that video he shows how to choose a good mouse and he has links on that site to his reviews and recommendations.  

## Measuring
at 2:04 in the video he shows how to measure your hand and says to get a mouse that is 60% of your hand size.

Mine is 7.5 inches long and 4 inches wide which is just within what he calls a medium hand size.
