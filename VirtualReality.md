# Myths #
1. VR Sickness is something you either have or don't.  
	- Many people have it to some degree (some dont even notice, like I used to get an apparently random headache and later realized that it was probably some level of VR motion sickness) but 
	- Solving it: for most of those people playing something that makes them sick for 1-5 minutes per day every day will feel much less motion sick in a week or two.  In my wifes case this worked in about 1 week where at first she couldn't even watch me play Snake Pass on a monitor from 6ft away but a week later she was sliding around quickly for literally hours on end in VR.  this would likely work for people who get motion sickness on boats but in that case once you're experiencing the motionsickness on a boat its too late to get off any time soona nd you are subject to that same motion for the next 20min while you get back to land. In VR you can just pull the helmet off, which brings me to my next point, 
	- How not to solve it: Playing through your sickness isn't a good way to solve motion sickness.  During this training phase don't overdo it, pull off the helmet at the first sign of any discomfort or sickness or headache or after 5 minutes is up for the first few days.  After the first few days experiment with more than 5 min.  If you stop playing VR and then come back to it a month later you may have to break yourself back in over the course of a few days to get used to it again.
	- Cristi got through it.  The simplest way is to play something that makes you sick every day but don't expect to make progress, just subject your body to it for one to five minutes and then pull the headset off and put the game away.  In two weeks it should be a different ballgame entirely and you should be able to play a bunch. 
	- Add to VR note: Some sickness comes during loading instantly.  tis quite disruptive even to relatively strong stomachs.  I bet some peoples reports of VR making thme sick is because their computer paused for a few instants while it was loading 
2. Gatekeeping VR.  Motion Controls and roomscale are required to experience 'true VR' and if you arent doing 'true VR' then VR is a waste of money.  "VR isn't primarily about the motion controls, it's about feeling like you exist in a fictional game world." - Stereo3DProductions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pf7T9txKsM
	Gatekeeping VR is small minded
	Virtual Reality devices aren't perfect Ready Player One level immersion yet and it will be a long time before we see anything like that mainstream.  Virtual Reality devices today are amazing tools that give you options for an enormous variety of immersive and entertaining and thrilling and chill experiences.  If you gatekeep yourself by deciding in advance what is and isn't true VR before you try things then you are hampering your experiences.  If what you want is motion controls, thats great, and I love them, but I dont always love them, sometimes I love the relaxing compact and unobtrusive nature of using a keyboard and mouse or gamepad control scheme and there are tons of VR experiences for which this is a great option if not the best option.  Gatekeeping someone elses experiences by saying its not true VR if it doesn't have motion controls gets under my skin because is limiting the breadth interested members in our community and attempting to limit the enjoyment and degree to which those in the community can leverage their devices to have peak experiences.  Besides gatekeeping VR based on motion controls isnt accurate since even with motion controls what we have today is not true VR (think the Matrix).  Motion controls are more VR than a gamepad, but they are not always more immersive and they are not always the most applicable or best control scheme.  Its only immersive if it doesn't get in your way so for someone used to a gamepad or keyboard and mouse who wants to have that experience but feel like they are in a 3d world then even a little bit of 6dof head tracking is instantly and deeply immersive, and if the control scheme is second nature then theres nothing to take you out of that immersive world.  If you're not used to using keyboard and mouse or gamepad then motion controls are a great place to start since you already know how to move your arms around so many in game motions are instantly second nature.  You can't replace motion controls with a gamepad, nor can you entirely replace the benefits of a gamepad (small size, long play comfort, ease, posture posture required, precision for some games), or a keyboard and mouse (many of the same advantages as the gamepad but with even more precision and more options (keys)), with motion controls.   I love motion controls. I also love keyboard and mouse.  I also love gamepads.  They're different and they're all great.    Basically if you can get immersed without VR then you will be more immersed with VR.
3. Gatekeeping VR based on locomotion technique.  Many of the same arguments about gatekeeping from the other answer apply here, but this one is even smaller minded.  If you prefer natural locomotion thats fine.  I agree that most expereinces should have natural and teleportation options and I completely understand if you dont want to use teleportation.  Perhaps it makes it less immersive, or for whatever reason you dont like it, but its vain (and inaccurate) to imagine that what you think is right is anything more than your personal preference even if you have asked around and the people around you seem to agree.  Its not helping welcome new people into our community to have great experiences and its dulling the experiences of some people within the community by making them second guess whether their preference is really best and none of this is helpful.  

# 3D #
Why Stereoscopic 3D is cool.  3D SBS is amazing for making your games more immersive and interesting.  
	(Thoughts on 3D Parallax like Shovel Knight 3DS.)  If your eye and brain get the instant advantage of never having to pick out what is in the foreground and the background the game becomes something new.  You get to enjoy the background as being BACKGROUND and effectively never interfering with your foreground gameplay.  You get to observe the backgrounds and they draw you into the game world, they make a 2D game have depth and therefore become more real and more like a reality.  They make the 2D worlds of your childhood or your past become more real. All of a sudden you have a portal into the depth of a world instead of a bunch of pictures of a world.  You feel like you could reach inside that world, you feel like you could manipulate things inside of that world, and with your controller in hand, as it becomes second nature (which for many retro players it already will be) it becomes possible to manipulate things in the foreground of that 3D world using your character as a proxy.  If you've played the game before it adds a feeling of depth and novelty to each screen as you traverse the world. It makes it into a remix of the content you have experience before and lets you experience it again with the addition of a new dimension.  
	- Map: Believe it or not the extra depth and understanding of where you are in a 3D space instead of just a 2D space helps my brain and imagination more easily map out where I am and construct a 3D imaginative map out of the world (even if the only action is on the 2D plane).  
	- Focus: It takes extraneous information about the setting and the world (the background layers) away from the world leaving only what is important (the foreground platforms, enemies, powerups, etc.  This comfort with the world comes with time even in a 2D setting but comes instantly in a 3D parallax setting.  It lets you relax in a subtle subliminal way you can't imagine until you try it and search for it with your feelings, knowing that you dont have to worry about 90% of the visual information entering your eyes. but you don't have to think about it or mentally filter it out, your brain knows: its not on the player layer so it can't hurt me. Then if something shoots from the background to the foreground its a fun surprise
	
		- make no mistake playing stereoscopic 3d in a vr helmet with the wiimote is absolutely vr.  its not 360 vr and you can't loook around and see in game but you can look around and see another world and that doesnt take you out of the immersive experience.  
		1. stereoscopic 3d
		2. look around 360 in the 3d world
		3. move around in the 3d world (6dof) 
		4. hand tracking (this has partial or simulated hand tracking that works really well to feeling like you are shooting the gun)
		5. teleporting
		6. free motion
		7. treadmill or something
		8. haptics
	
# VR Sickness #
The only statistics I’ve ever heard is 30% experience problems.  It’s a real issue for a lot of people but it’s also a loud minority talking about it.  For those who it affects it’s from minor (a headache or vague nausea but only in some games and only when I haven’t slept well) to my wife (who sometimes at the beginning got nauseous even watching me play non vr games on my monitor, and who at first 10 minutes in the wrong vr situation would mess her up for a day) and probably worse.  My wife is totally fine with it now unless it’s a weird day and she already wasn’t feeling great.  

Also all of the evidence I’ve seen says that people can get used to it, but probably not by just powering through it.  My wife would get in vr and go real slow for less than five minutes in a day to start.
	
Interesting Where did you hear the 30%?

	I'm glad you asked!  That was one of those things that you read and it sticks in your mind and I don't remember where but that was back in 2017.  I found [this VR metastudy]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7145389/) which says that the mean dropout rate was 15.9% over 46 experiments but I suspect that more than 15.9% had some symptoms but just didn't nope out of it.  Also it depended on what activity they were doing in VR.  It is not really a black/white thing since most people can probably experience motion sickness under just the right terrible circumstances, for example I watched one of the worlds greatest surfers vomit during astronaut training.  Also as many as [40% of pilots experienced some sickness during simulator training](https://www.livescience.com/54478-why-vr-makes-you-sick.html) but the OP was talking about 'raging nausea' which is quite different.  

P.S. If you asked Gabe Newell of Valve back in 2015 he would say [0% get sick if you use the Vive](https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/5/8153101/valve-boss-gabe-newell-says-noone-gets-sick-using-vive-vr) lol

This study doesnt say what they were doing but whatever twisted shit they were doing and whatever hardware they used made 77% of women report that they felt motion sickness.   What does taht mean?  was it bad or lingering or just slight?  They drew some big conclusions from that that I believe are unwarranted, and things have changed a lot since 2015 or 2016 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311394218_The_virtual_reality_head-mounted_display_Oculus_Rift_induces_motion_sickness_and_is_sexist_in_its_effects

# Games & Experiences #

* Trackmania Turbo VR (2/1/19)
	- Purchased Mar 22 2018.  I beat this in Feb 2019 started playing it soon after I got my VR in 2017 or 2018.  I had so much fun.  I got gold or Higher on every race lots of S ranks.  The VR is so damn cool.  Believe it or not playing the game in non-vr is also amazing on the huge built in theater screen even if its not in 3D.  I never spent much time non-vr.  I tried hard playing this with motion controls at first but it just didnt work, but as soon as I plugged in an xbox controller everything clicked and it worked perfectly.  Its so cool flying up in the air, and its great controls and racing is a blast.  Its also cool to see the track from different perspectives and to look around while you're going super fast.  For a more casual racer getting bronze or silver on every track would be a fair challenge. 
* The Talos Principle (10/1/19) - Wow this surprised me with greatness.  I was expecting quality since its croteam and I've had nothing but good experiences with their VR, but wow this is so immersive and fun and great.  The puzzles are going to get devious I can tell but the interface with the puzzles is just fantastic with no clumsiness or hiccups.  Theres great locomotion options for everyone and I just had a blast and am super impressed.  I beat 2 levels and died twice.  Thats a great game!
* Dont Knock Twice (10/2/19) This is really good.  It gave me some serious chills with one of the jump scares but mostly its a super creepy vibe and great scary game.  I probably played for 30 min and I have no idea if I missed things or what.  I didn't know where to go so I stopped but I suspect if I just did another once over of all of the places I could go I would figure out the next step.
* Cartoon Network Journeys VR (10/5/19) holy crap the jester thing is so cool because they did something Ive never heard before: they gave instructions and background in the form of a cute musical song when  you are about to start the level!  I love it so much!  oh and holy crap the jester game was so much fun!  It was so well scripted and entertaining and interesting.  The golden goose cannon!  hahaha!!!!  This is one of the best ever.
* Tinertia (10/9/19) I actually started playing this a long time ago (many months) but took some breaks in between but for the last few weeks I've been trying to beat just the final boss and have been trying to play a few minutes every day.  I finally beat him today and it was so satisfying!  Here's the review I wrote on Steam: Wow!  This is unexpectedly one of the best games I've ever played.  Its tough as nails but its one of the few games that really gets it right and the difficulty is completely fair.  The final level was brutal but thats how final levels are supposed to be.  To describe a typical gameplay later-level gameplay session a bit: you will start a level and 10 seconds in to the level you will die but then you will instantly restart (it doesn't belabor the process with any real delays) and you will get 15 seconds into the level and die, and so on and so forth until you beat it.  Off the top of my head each level is like 1-2min long so you're never taken back very far and there are checkpoints in the levels in fair places so you're never doing things too many times unfairly.  I am stressing fairness because so many difficult games are unfair and take you back too far when you die or make you start the game over or something absurd like that.  Well none of that happens here.  In this way it reminds me of the game VVVVVV which while in most other respects a completely different game had a similar continue structure.  Now to the gameplay: the controls are tight and interesting and fantastic.  In case you haven't heard you control movement generally (like walking and in air movement) with the left stick but the right stick shoots your rocket which is ultimately the primary method of locomotion so you'll be shooting that into walls and floors at precisely the right instant to get a big boost and go flying in the direction you intend (hopefully).  Its a great control scheme that is perfectly executed and is fun to learn and (by the end of the game) master.  The difficulty curve is great and it never gets too too hard (at least it didnt for me) and the longevity is great because after you beat the main campaign (which it looks like took me about 9hrs which is probably incredibly slow) there are a ton of procedurally generated levels and a couple other modes (speed run and boss rush) plus you can go back and try to beat each level of the campaign with less than a certain number of jumps or under a certain time par.  The graphics are amazing too with incredible detail and care taken to make the backgrounds and foregrounds look amazing and I absolutely love this 2.5d style.  I played the whole thing in VR and it was incredible and immersive to look around and see what was coming in 10-15 seconds and I think it gave me an advantage because I could see some of the obstacles in advance.  Well thats enough gushing but it was just fantastic.  P.S. If you want to play this with Windows Mixed Reality VR headsets just download 'pseudovive' which takes less than a minute to install and you'll be off and running.    Way to go Candescent games.  I just wonder why people aren't talking about this more.  
* Rez Infinite (10/9/19) I first played this about a month ago and it was great.  I actually beat the whole game and only then found out that you can fix the control scheme and man it is so much better!  If you change it from being dependent on where you look to just being aiming with the controller only its a completely different game and this should be the default option, however now that you know its real easy to change and it makes it one of the best games on the system.  If you like the idea of shooting things in a retro 3d sci-fi lawnmower man world with thumping beats then this is for you.  I love it so much with the new scheme I'll probably end up playign it again.  In fact I just played the first lievel and got 98.4% of enemies and didn't get hit once on the level boss.
* Chiaro and the Elixir of Life - This is a cool game and I think it could be really good.  I was using pseudovive on accident (I don't think thats required with this game) and perhaps as a result after the first scene I was stuck undergournd.  At least you can reset the ground level right?  Well then I just started falling for the next several minutes with the skybox and level all gettin gfurther and further above me.  I wasn't drawn in and didnt love it enough to continue right now but maybe another time.  It looked like it had tons of charm and the mechanics worked well and it looked like it could be a great experience and I've heard its got plenty of length. 
* Spiderman (11/17/19) If I'm not being picky then this was really great the swinging worked well and it gave you a fun feeling of swinging through new york and making a difference, and it had top quality voice actors which made you feel like you were in the movie and thats really what I have to say about it, but if you want to hear my picky opinion: it was a bit clumsy, particularly the part about the giant covered in road bits which it wasnt clear how to pull those off.  Thats just me being pick though and this is a really cool experience that everyone interested should play and will enjoy.
* The Gallery Starseed (11/22/19) This is really great.  I didnt solve any puzzles yet but I got to the top of the cave and played a tape in my cool 80s tape deck and played with my flashlight and broke some bottles and blinked all around rotating my playspace.  Its got some of the best controls in VR and one of the best cleverly and wonderfully narrated tutorials in VR.  This is highly recommended for anyone who wants a cool VR experience in another world and certainly for anyone who liked MYST.  I really haven't gotten into it at all and I actually suspect I'll get stumped on the puzzles pretty quickly but I'm looking forward to see how far I can get. 
* Overload (8/12/19) Started April 25, finished Aug 12.  This was a great game and the VR was fantastic.  If you like FPS controls then this is a wonderful purchase and it was worth every second I sunk into it and was so much fun.  It was addictive and rewarding.  The levels were sprawling and interesting and always surprising and it was fun to figure out how they worked and how to escape from each level.  There was always help like a hologram to show you the way to the exit and probably even show you the way to the next thing you had to do too.  There was one graphical glitch where it was washing white in one eye but not the other but I was able to clear it up by turning off some graphic or lighting setting (see judgegroovymans discussion on steam for the solution).
* Viral EX (12/18/19) I beat this earlier this year and this is one of the best games I've played in VR.  Now the reviews are a bit misleading because they imply that the bouncing balls is an enormous part of the game and its not, Its a part of the strategy for many levels sure, but really its a game of plotting out how to hit the things you need to hit.  Its got an excellent continue structure so its never annoying and it lets you try each level many times until you make the progress you want.  I got some top scores worldwide in the game on some levels!  
* Trackmania 12/18/19 - I beat this earlier this year and it is one of the best VR experiences I've had.  Obvious possible motion sickness aside (just play for one to five minutes per day and stop for the day and you'll be ok in a week or two).  I just loved looking around and seeing all of the awesome scenery go by so fast.  The graphics are great.  Complaints:  1.  Why can't we play the whole game in VR?  2. Its not clear up front that you have to play with xbox controller (touch controllers not supported but they seem to be but it will never work quite right) but once you start it works well.  3. Bugs like one of the levels starts you off way zoomed out and you have to play some of the game that way.  4. Why in the world can't we choose to play the whole game (even going through loops and everything) in first damn person?  There should be an option to turn off the pulling out to 3p mode.  Those are all minor considering the great time I had with it.  I got Gold or above on every level ... maybe I even did better than that?  I did really well.    For the record playing the whole game in the VR theater is actually still really fun and starts to feel like VR even if it isn't.  It works great.  
* Thumper - 12/18/19 This is such a cool rhythm game the only problem is its getting pretty hard and I'm only like 1/3 through.  I love looking around in VR.  Its really immersive and you can lose hours just racing and hitting buttons to the beat.
* Vertigo - 12/18/19 I beat this like a year ago and it was a really cool experience with awesome VR puzzles and some huge bosses and exciting battles and great use of VR all the way through.  Highly recommended.
* Hatchick 
	- 12/18/19 This is one of the coolest shooters in VR which has the same control scheme as the shoooter game in the Lab, but this game has a cool funky chick vibe and some amazing bullet hell patterns to avoid with great shooting and its lots of fun.  I beat the whole game but would enjoy playing it again someday.  
* Serious Sam The Second Encounter (AKA Serious Sam 2 AKA Serious Sam TSE) 
	- this is amazing.  I love it so much the graphics are a big step up from the first one and there are so many cool instances where theres a (playing on hard mode) jump scare because an enemy comes from out of nowhere.  Its so damn cool.  Plus tehres save anywhere and quick save.  There are tons of cool weapons and lots of situations which you really have to work hard to survive with so many damn enemies everywhere.  One I got stuck on was a huge field where at the end of the field it went left and then there was another field going the other way.  I thought I had to plow through the enemies to make it to the left side but really I could just take them all out on the right side where there was more room and they werent spawning.  I actually felt so stuck I took a break for a few months but when I came back to it I just decided to see if I could take them out on the rigth hand side and sure engouh I could.  It was super fun after that.  I already beat the first game and had a blast.  One of the wonderful things about these games is how perfect for VR that they are since there are tons of huge enemies whos scope makes you feel like a tiny ant.  (especially the bosses).  I'm playing with sliding locomotion and you have to train yourself a bit to feel ok with any kind of sliding locomotion, but this game sometimes expects you to move really fast on hard mode but if you are using teleport  thats fine just start on the easiest mode and work up from there . Its a blast.  One of my favorite VR games.  Its long and interesting all the way through.  I love admiring the architecture which is something you could only do a fraction of as much in the flat game.
* Nano Assault 3DS - 6/1/2020
	- Holy shit this is amazing.  Dual stick shooter levels punctuated by occasional space harrier style levels.  The 3d is amazing on both since on the dual stick ones its around the outside of a bean like in mario galaxy and in the space harrier levels its some of the coolest on rails gliding through scary alien or nano passages and fighting huge beasts all along the way.  Its so cool.  Its tough as nails though so I have to try several times to beat each level.  The continue structure is forgiving: 3 lives (or so) and then you start the level again unlimited continues on each level.  The levels are arranged like neurons so you follow one to the next to attack the virus.  Its a cool story.  Great low-ish poly but clearly rendered graphics with great textures.  Its SO Immersive!  Oh did I mention I'm playing in VR on BigScreen?  It works so perfectly.  I mapped the abxy buttons to the right stick to get stick controls but I mights witch it back since its clumsy using analog for digital and see what its like.  Anyway I found a BIG Winner!  Oh wow its pretty expensive on Amazon: $40-50! Damn!
* Starfox 64 3DS Citra - 6/1/2020  
	- I own this but never threw it in my 3DS, but its really cool! The tutorial is a bit long winded but I guess its good to know all the moves you can do.  This actually has some pretty deep space combat believe it or not.  Its fun through the tutorial but I haven't been able to play because its super slow.  Underclocking to 50%-80% crashed, 90% doesnt crash but also doesnt speed up (maybe 5%).  The 3D is really cool though.  
	- Older Citra works perfectly with this!  1499 and 1599 releases of canary work perfectly.  in Fact Canary 1688 works but 1690 doesnt (both on April 22) and then May 11-12 Nightly 1543 works but 1544 doesnt. 
	- Starfox 64 runs at 100% speed in older builds and 60% speed in newer builds.  I've tried underclocking to 80% CPU and it sped up to 70% of game speed, underclocking to 75% CPU crashed.  Immediately after booting (during intro/title screen/main menu) you can tell whether its running slow or not. I had the same problem with it running slow but I saw some youtube videos from 2017 and 2018 where people had this game running full speed so I tried multiple releases and found the following: Nightly 1543: 100% speed.  Nightly 1544: 60% speed. (that was around May 11-12)  Canary 1688: 100% speed. Canary 1690: 60% speed.  (that was around April 22)  Update: After the citra mod provided some information about it working for him I tried some other stuff and found out that it runs well even with the latest builds if I underclock a bit and turn off new 3ds mode thats what really made the big difference.
* Time Crisis PSX in EmuVR with Light Guns! 6/2/2020
	- Wow this was amazing (although my arm is now sore haha) It took a while to get setup and even after I did everything apparently right I still was confused because my hands werent turning into guns but eventually they did.  I dont know what changed but I had to have the BeetlePSXHW core selected with the light gun box checked and 260 ID which I know I had at one point before.  Then when I trigger and down on the pad then it started working.  I got to the boss battle with sherudo and I think I was one to two hits away from knocking him out of that portal he was jumping back and forth in the hallway.  Thats with 8 continues.  My palms were sweaty.  I have to say there arent many other games that make you feel like such a one man army as that one.  You feel like a total bad ass.  I love the theatrics too.  I love the gameplay too since its about memorizing certain possible patterns as well as shooting correctly.  The enemies are interesting too they will like shuffle back and forth right when you shoot at them and stuff.   
* Alien Chaos 3D - 6/2/2020 
	- this is a cool platform run n gun single screen based where you shoot aliens and clean up after yourself which is an interesting mechanic and really does add some distinction to the core gameplay.   Its pretty fun and works great in citra.  It seems though like you have to restart your computer if it crashes maybe it never closes the save file or something?
* Compound 6/2/2020
	- I played this for a few hours enough to beat it a year or two ago and it was fantastic back then.  I loved being in this low resolution low poly world and it was so interesting just looking around.  Also its scary seeing whats around each corner.  I just beat a boss ( A business man behind a shield) and got pretty darn far ... R&D 2 perhaps?   This is fantastic.  I played it and felt sick earlier then played something else and wanted to play this again :)  6/3/2020 I got to the executive suite twice and the final battle twice (maybe thrice).  This is such a fantastic game. 
* Pac-Man & Galaga Dimensions 6/7/2020
	- Runs great in Citra.  There are like 6 games in this game and Pac Man, Galaga, Pac Man Championship and Galaga Legends work really well and are super fun.  This is the best most fun version of pac man CE I've played cool replays too.  The depth of the screen is just really cool.  Its not high res but it looks good.  Galaga Legends is a really cool interesting shooter with tons of enemies on screen almost bullet hell like certainly bullet hell quantity.  there are a few other original games in here which dont really work because they expect tilt controls so I couldnt get anywhere with the Galaga 3D Impact.  This is really good and fun and it has a cheesy silly but cool 3d movie animatedly dramatizing pac mans origin story :)  This is great fun.
* Harmoknight 3DS 6/7/2020
	- Well this is cool its kind of like space channel 5 but its a platform game.  the timing seems just slightly 'off' like you have to click just slightly early but when you get used to it then it works well.  I wonder if thats an emulation thing?  Maybe I'll buy it on 3DS and find out.  In this kind of game the timing might be more noticeable than in other circumstances.  Its cutesy fun.  I admit I dont love the style or the setting or the story.  I like cute stuff but not particularly this one but I liked the gameplay quite a bit.
* Lethal VR 6/9/2020
	- Although ultimately a target practice or shooting gallery game its really really cool and has a great leaderboard system that makes you want to try each event many times over to get the best score that you think you can get.  I suspect some cheating since the best scores are 5 times larger than mine and I got pretty high.  Its really fun and I want to get the best scores I think I can on the last few events (probably tomorrow) and call it done.  Worth the money.  I got in the top 1000 on several events and was really proud to get like 100% and very fast times sometimes.  Id say on several of the events (at least one in particular) reloading planning is the biggest slowdown of all. I got 101th place on one of the events and am pretty sure I could do better!
* Windlands 7/15/2020 
	- I have had to strap paper towels to my controllers because pretty quickly when playing this game my hands (and even feet) get slimy and drenched with sweat.  Its thrilling and exciting and scary too and I do experience trepidation, but less when I'm swinging and flying than when I'm walking around on a tiny platform or up tiny cliffsides or tree branches (since thats something I'm afraid to do irl) (i'm pretty afraid of heights even though they thrill me in case that wasnt clear).  I don't think my brain is too scared but my body sure is and it shows it through the sweats.  thats a testament to the scale and excitement that come with this game.  Its so cool to swing around but the swinging doesn't come real easy its actually a super hard game that is taking me several days to get any semblance of smoothness too, the levels are designed to give lots of options so there are probably ways to really fly through them but mostly I have to take them very carefully and judge my jumps and take one jump or swing at a time whenever I can.  Today I figured out and got ok at hanging from a point and then dropping from that point and when I was pretty far down shooting back up to that point which then pulled me up and launched me quite a bit higher than I originally was.  I also took an enormous dive off of a huge peak at the highest point in an area after I had scaled to the top and it was really a cool experience to fall from that height.  I think it took like 30s to get to the bottom (tehn again time can seem to expand in exciting situations like that).   7/18/2020 At the top of world 2 on the floating pirate ship theres a shitty problem: The pyramid goal trophy thing is high at the bow and theres some clear boards to get there but their colliders arent right and you fall right off of them.  You have to know to jump entirely over them.  You cant trust what you see which in the entire rest of the game you can adn thsi is a vulnerable moment where youve climbed to the top of the mountain.
* Space Harrier 3DS 7/17/2020 using Citra Emulator in SBS mode in BigScreen.  
	- This is so amazing.  It is not virtual reality in the sense that I can look behind me and see the aliens flying off in the distance. Its also not first person virtual reality, but its an amazingly immersive and fantastic experience using 3D and VR hardware to create that experience.  Using Big Screen it feels like you are in a futuristic but comfortable fireplace heated livingroom with a huge floor to ceiling viewport.  I say viewport not screen because using SBS mode it seems like youre looking out a window into another world in this case the world of Space Harrier.  In some sense it is like you are on the deck of TNG Enterprise looking out into space, but it is in 3D so it looks like you could walk out of your livingroom and into the fantasy zone and go stand next to the Space Harrier.  Scale is incredible since the harrier is of a similar scale to a human which makes it easier to imagine yourself in that role and to see the immensity of the beasts and trees and rocks and ships as they come right up in to your face in the viewport is incredible.  Additionally since its wall/theater sized when you hit a tree or a huge robot and they are stuck right there in your face you have to look up to see the top of them and it conveys an amazing sense of scale and a sense of awe.  Depth this is adjsutable i set it to a settting of 12% since at 15% and larger, for my eyes, it started to make me focus significantly different when I was trying to keep the background in focus as well as the foreground.  None of it was broken at mroe than 15 and it probably did seem deeper, but at 12% I tried to estimate and if I think and analyze then my best guess it looks like the mountains in the back are 30ft away from the player which gives an incredible feeling of depth.  At one point I thought about it like I was playing with a whole set of flying interactive lifesized toys and I get to look into this toybox and shoot things.  Its so cool.  Another thought I had was that my movie theater (and believe me just as my real livingroom melts away when I go into the virtual movie theater, so does the virtual theater melt away when I go into the 3d virtual world of space harrier) is a tank moving quickly through the fantasy zone with a huge impenetrable glass viewport and the harrier is running and flying along just in front of the glass and doing his harri-ying(sp?) and I'm just there to watch.  I loved the whole thing.  More about this game in Games.md  Finally I find myself wanting to play as many stereoscopic 2.5d games in this setting as I can, its one of the coolest things ever.  I feel like I would rather play a game I've played before but in stereoscopic 3d or a game I didnt previously really want to play but if it were like this I would rather play it.  I feel like I want to play as many games in this situation as I can at the cost of many other situations.  Oh  yeah!  Another thing!  using the xbox controller there was actually dpad and control stick support and they complimented each other perfectly in this game: the control stick was better for moving all over the screen at a fast pace, but when I wanted to focus on one spot (bosses) or when I wanted to hit enemies that I knew were about to be in a particular place (those attack pattern enemies) then the dpad was better because it didnt recenter and would stay where you put it.  That was amazing to get the options to use it those two different ways.

* Wario World GC 7/18/2020
	- This let me pick up where I left off since I played this (super glitchy) in Dolphin VR.  Now I can play in full 3D SBS and it works fantastic and is super fun and I could enjoy playing the whole game this way.  Slight glitches: 1. it flashes just the littlest bit every minute or two and is distracting.  2. The frame rate of the game seeems low so the whole game seems a bit choppy. #Again
* Contra Rebirth Wiiware 7/18/2020
	- This is a fantastic game.  I just beat the first level and its laid out so that everything comes at you the same way every time. I love the weapons and the controls and the feel and its satisfying learning how to beat each level and get to the next checkpoint.  unfortuantely its not 3d in any sense so the dolphin doesnt do anythign with stereoscopic. I saved a save state. #Again
* Excitebike Wiiware 7/18/2020
	- this crashes with a graphics pipeline problem when you start but you can ignore it and it still seems to work.  It IS in 3d and it looks great and plays great.  Its not grabbing me though but would be fun to try to beat the courses and I'm glad it works.  The more I play it the more the scrolling stutters and gets in the way of it being too much fun, but the music is excellent and fun and the sound and gameplay are great.  
* Sin & Punishment Wii eshop 7/18/2020
	- Tihs is really cool. the stereoscopic works great and is super immersive.  I dont completley understand the controls but the graphics are excellent and the shooting works great I beat the first level (though just barely) and the story seems exciting some kind of superheroes or something. I saved a state.
* Vampire Crystals Wii Eshop 7/18/2020 
	- The game seems to work and the 3d looks great I dont understand though how to control it, I had to plug in virtual nunchuck and I did and then it let me sort of start the game but I dont even know how to select menus wihtout an actual wiimote.  I set it to use the left stick and it seems to be pointing ok (if not accurately).  Update: I got it working really great by emulating the classic controller!  boy this looks to be an excellent dual stick shooter!  Its cute and plays great!  I used a 16bit filter and it looks awesome!  The times on each level are a bit tight.  it seemst o have unlimited continues but I imagined the arbitrary time limits are going to be a problem.  I like the weapons.  I accidentally lost all of my progress by not continuing :( no its good actually it let me continue when I reloaded.  This is a good forgiving game.  there are plenty of time powerups if you go looking for them.  Also this game looks like it might be kind of short which is nice - nope its probably got more worlds than I thought.  I dont know how to pause.  im on level 1-5 and Ive died like 6 times because of time or life.  I'm probably up to 10 times.  Its still fun but I think the curve is too steep.  Probably 12th time I beat it.  Beat the boss the first time!  Its a really good game really.  Lets see looks like world 2 is different scenery and its really nice and beautiful.  Apparenlty therea re two players in this game.  Some of the weapons in these levels are awesome!  Huge missiles and 5 way that follows the ground.  Lots of variety here. and lots of enemy variety too.  With the supersampling the game looks really really good. I think I got tolevel 2-3.  Died a bunch 
* Gradius Rebirth Wiiware 7/19/2020 
	- Awesome stereoscopic 3D  and a really cool game with a great continue structure.  I beat the first level in about 10min and love the graphics and am enjoying myself.  	I got really far past a crab eye ball boss and it took me like 30 min and it was super hard, including the build up to the boss which was hard too and you have to be very sneaky to get all the powerups you need. I used a laser.  I spent like 4 hours on thsi game so much fun got through 3 levels.  the continue structure is fantastic. perfct.  I think I ended up at 4-3  #Again  
	- 1-14-2021 apparently there are only 5 levels so I'm pretty close to the end!  lets see if I can pick it up again today!was I playing the 257 version?  lets see if theres a save state?  Oh No!  it wont let me load the save state because I was runnign a differetn version of dolphin!  lets switch back and see if it works then!  12247  Once I downloaded that exact version and then had to debug changing the free loook camera to sixaxis ... then it loaded but I dont know if it worked, but definitely I can start on level 4-3 so thats great!  would that work without the save state?  lets see yup it works without the save state!
	- Fantastic game.  I beat a boss and it probably took me 30 tries. now on this second boss there is an eleevator part right in advance and the boss is kind of an up and down conveyor belt you ahve to shoot through so you need the laser and well ... in the elevator part in advance of the boss tehre are tons of awesome powerups if you play that part right which is a really cool way to give you the possiblity to be poered up when  you hit the boss.  ithink its shitty when shooter games punish imperfection by making you powerless and effectively making it WAAY harder to the point of near impossibility.  I think thats stupid.  then again its easier to make the game because thats a simple rule but then a game like this designs the levels and powersup around that rule (somewhat at least and certaily in this area) 
	- one of hte reasons this is so great is its unlimited continues from the last checkpoint which are frequent
	- cool vr 3dsbs or emulation artifact the tiles are clearly delineated and that makes it like pasted with paper
	- omg I beat it! #win 1-14-2021.  I beat it on easy or whatever with 7 lives.  they say your mission is not over and you have to do another loop but you have to do it on normal.  fuck that!  I'm so proud it was very hard but I love games like this with unlimited continues.  I can always win with enough patience!  I dont lose legitimate progress.  this was so great
	- WMR pissed me off big time.  I wanted a screenshot so I switched out to desktop and then when I got back to VR ... the windows mixed reality window was in front of the cutscenes goddamnit!  it wouldnt go away windows key windows y alt tab nothing.  I fired up my wmr controller to click out of it and accidentally clicked the flashlight and counlnt get out of that and by the time I was out wmr had killed steam VR and virtual desktop!  I could see it mostly tho and could take off my hmd but didnt get to experience it in peace.  no big deal just grrr.
* Castlevania The Adventure Rebirth Wiiware 7/18/2020 
	- This is really cool.  It took me one failure to beat the first level and boss.  This is a really good game.  I feel like I could eventually actually beat this.  It feels do-able.  It saved my progress in a save file in game.  Unfortunately this is NOT 3D which is slightly disappointing to me.
* Wario Land Virtual Boy - 7/18/2020 
	- DL retroarch and load the Beetle core and the game and when the game is playing open the menu (F1) go to options and 3d mode and set it to SBS.  Now it works and its in 3D SBS!  F key to go exclusive full screen.  Note:  things in the distance are doubled so I need to change some settings somehow but dont know how.  In the retroarch folder theres shaders/glsl/stereoscopic-3d/side-by-side.glslp where you can set some parameters but I dont know if it reads them or not.  I just changed the eye distance to something wildly different and it didnt change in the emulator.  In fact I'm not sure its using these shaders for these games, maybe these are for like n64 or PSX games or something.  Maybe theres a more specific beetle setting?  Ok in Retroarch/Config/Beetle VB/ theres Beetle VB.opt and in the [documentation here](https://mednafen.github.io/documentation/vb.html) theres similar corresponding options to what are in this file (underscores replacing dots) so I'm going to try changing vb.sidebyside.separation to 10 and restart the core and see what changes.  I dont think it read in my setting because it looks exactly the same.  Update: When in Big Screen I move further back (like in the theater to the back of the theater) then while it doesnt look as cool imho, the things in the back of the 3d arent doubled up and look clearer.  Even then I have to refocus when looking in the front and back but at least its possible for me to do so.  Things I can try: Getting a retroarch Virtual Boy build from someone who has it working, or getting the underlying retroarch emulator working wihtout retroarch so I can set the settings manually (trying this now). Its pretty easy.  run it once Mednafen.exe and it makes a default config file with all options in it set.  In there change anaglyph to sbs and then I can change the sidebyside separation.  I put in 500 and it made the distance between the two entire views of the game real wide, I guess thats all it does.  I dont know if that is about to help with depth or not but I'll try 0, 10, 50, 100, 200 1000 see what happens.  Ok so theres a bit of a problem because it doesnt have any input devices setup apparently.  Ok so I've gotten used to the idea that I need to sit a little bit back from the screen.  I think they should offer a depth option in their emulator but they don't so thats ok.  I played the first level of wario and it was super fun!
* Metroid Prime 7/19/2020 DolphinVR
	- Wow this is really cool.  The VR seems to work great with gamepad and the graphics (when upscaled) are really fantastic looking and performance is great.  Graphics have some glitches?  yes definitely.  Nothing problematic though and its amazing being immersed in that world with head and view tracking.  "Prime 1/2 both work amazingly well, so well in fact I would dare call them essential VR experiences."  So now people are saying that you can decouple the gun from the head, and use the vive wands to play the game.  When they say that in this game I was pretty stunned since I thought they meant that you could aim with the vive wands, but I didnt think that was possible at first and I still dont despite people saying that you can.  When I re-read things I dont think anyone is saying that you can actually aim with the vive wands, just that the gun while generally stationary isn't totally stuck to the side of your head as you turn your head (which is pretty unrealistic.  It should be aiming forward at all times regardless of your heads direction.  If I use the keyhole setting then I can change the yaw with the stick and it doesnt turn my head. Maybe that helps some people with motion sickness?  it would probablyalso make it harder to dodge enemy projectiles.

	- [Vive controllers work like a charm](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/4prtxv/dolphin_vr_50/) I dont think they mean that it aims ... 
	- So 7/20/2020 well so today I figured out by playing in non vr that you have to hold the right trigger and move the left stick to aim the scanner and in non vr its clear where the scanner is aiming but in VR that overlay is gone so thats what makes it hard to aim the scanner.  The guy in [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1oKpb4mv5g) probably the first one in that series anyway says that is one of the wieirdes parts.  Another thing I figured out today is I was using the V1.2 of the iso and thats not right for the patches. It was having errors and only running if I didnt patch the culling.  With the regular rom it ran the culling patches and everything worked better overall!  I got past the first boss and it was super fun and got down to the planet :)
* Sin & Punishment Star Successor 7/20/2020 Wii Dolphin VR.  
	- Whats cool is as soon as I selected the wiimote and nunchuk first option preset the pointer showed up immediately.  No tweaking needed!  I was able to select something on a menu and I'm blown away and really looking forward to playing these shooting games in VR and with this control scheme assuming it continues to work.
	- Now its not calibrated so well since I put it down to type, also I dont know what buttons are what. 
	- ok the first part of the intro cutscene looked great with just a little glitch, but then in game everythign was black.  I was able to shoot and move and those seemed to work.
	- Important note: this isn't accurate the same way VR aiming is accurate even though I thought it would be.  Its not. Its shaky andjumpy just like the wii pointer was back in the day and its not instantaneous, the pointer follows you around with a tiny delay.  
	- Ultimately it doesnt work. The gameplay is all blacked out unfortunately.
	- Update: 7/22/2020 back to Dolphin: oh wow this is a bad ass game when the control scheme is right.  I got it working with wiimote/nunchuck both mapped to xbox controller and wow it works fantastic!  I think I could enjoy playing this all the way through with this control scheme becuase it works so damn well.  	Its so much fun like space harrier and the grpahics and UI all works so damn solid.  I think I like this better than aiming with the wiimote.  It always jumps back to center which makes it easy to aim.  I love it so much.  Beat the first level pretty easily this way and had lots of fun doing it.
	- How does it work with mouse and keyboard?  Ok well after some config it actually works perfectly too, however its not as intuitive for me personally so I will probably use the controller instead.  It might work better in full screen now that I think about it. Lets try that.
	- How does it work with the motechuck controlscheme in sbs?  In a word: Perfect.
	- I mean ... now that I'm playing like this, this is one of the coolest games thats ever been made. Its like modern space harrier for gods sakes but with generally fair difficulty.  Only on one of the bosses did it seem like I would have been forced to take some damage, but frankly I bet theres a way around that. 
	
* Burnout 2 7/20/2020 Wii Dolphin VR
	- This works well enough to be absolutely super fun.  I have great memories of this game and its still fun.  I love this. 
	- There are some graphical glitches the most jarring being a strange UI element that pops up during menus with lots of reflections and mirroring in it, but also it pops up during boosting which is pretty disruptive.  I'll check and see if anyone has any codes for it.  its got a code built in but it doesnt have a fix for the menu.
	- I wonder if this would work even better in 3D SBS?  I dont know but I kind of doubt it because its so damn cool being able to look around like this.  
	- the replays are cool to watch too.  The graphics are definitely quite dated though.  For whatever reason I dont feel motion sickness in this game.  Maybe 3rd person perspective, maybe because people are used to driving in cars?
	- #Again
	- 1/15/2021 in desktop mode this has some kind of glitch where its just constantly switching screen sizes and is unplayable.
	
* Alien Hominid 7/20/2020 
	- This is really cool.  In VR you can see things you couldnt otherwise.  There is depth to each building in the parallax background, not much, but just enough that it looks like its all cut out of construction paper and separated by a little foam pad like 1cm or so apart.  Also off to the right and left is the edges of the textures that are scrolling past and youc an see their ends which is interesting and makes it seem like its the end of the world always just a bit ahead ofyou.  
	- It plays great with standard controller and the playscreen is really huge like a theater, which means its hard to keep situational awareness of where your enemies just spawned in from so its not a good way to play this game but its pretty cool for a while though!
	- I nearly beat the Cyclops boss level 2 maybe got 27k used like 3 continues and it was really fun!  
	- otoh probably wont play it again 
* The Return of the King 7/20/2020
	- The presentation is amazing. I'm watching some clear movie footage on a large theater screen.  Looks and sound amazing and really draws me in.  
	- #Again omg this is so much fun and so cool and bad ass.  I really feel like I'm in the movie and saving middle earth!
	- Its clumsy in a lot of ways but epic and awesome in others.  Where you might imagine theres a huge battle going on if you were only looking in one direction, there may not be culling behind you but theres also not a huge array of troops fighting.
	- I've got the two towers but it doesnt have any codes.  It might work anyway who knows.
	- The GUI between levels is on the floor beneath your feet haha
	Even if its below me and therefore hard to look at, it looks great adn I actually love the style.  Stone background with gandalf, and a foot in front of that is four helmets wtih my ratings in all of their levels.  Its great.  Lots of little situations where the gui is like behind me or the background is behind me where it should be in front.  None of it matters totally playable.    The level select menu is actually really awesome.  its ina  big cylinder tower building and its runes up a wall its really cool in vr.
	- And I think thers lots of room for replay since theres many paths you can take.  This is really great.  This osgiliath miission is so bad ass.  there is fighting everywhere amazing ruined buildings and a dragon flying overhead.  ITs so bad ass.  oh nad huge cannonballs flying at you in VRTheres lots of opportunities to see through walls to the edges of hte city in VR but also to see the action from perspectives you wouldnt otherwise.  Its so cool.  Lots of blinky locks tho which momentarily mess with your eyes.
	- I love the mechanic about sneaking around in osgiliath avoiding the eye of hte enemy and then fightingmy way through to antoher safe zone. 
	- There are checkpoints during the levels and its a pretty hard game with medium-interesting combat, but I've had to play teh same part of osgiliath many times and in the past that would have been so frustrating that I would have not enjoyed it so much, but now especially since volgarr the viking I understand and appreciate this continue structure better and appreciate how much more interesting the levels end up being when I know them so well
	- This is one of my favorites ever and I have some regrets that I never played this back in the day.  If I didnt own it I rented it and never really sank the time into it.  Same with Two Towers honestly but that one I did sink time into and got halfway through it.  It was hard and I wasnt so good at trying games many times. I guess I felt like it was a waste of my time and I had other important (restlessness) things to do.  But if I had really immersed myself into those games like I am doing now boy I think I would have loved them back then and fallen in love with them as some of my favorite games ever despite their faults.  Two Towers doesn't let you go back and try a level again once youve beaten it, I heard arumor this one does, and this one has co op so this is a better game in those regards.  I remember getting half way through two towers and it was painful because I was dying so often and I didnt do that well and wanted to try it again because there was a branching path or a choice or I needed a certain score to get an item or something, and there was a huge problem in my mind because I felt I would have to play the whole game over again to get a better score.  This was like 2006.
* Excite Truck 7/20/2020
	- this is great!  A little slowdown and a little hud darkness sometimes but the racing is great.  Theres no cull codes but theres still lots to tlook at the culling isnt bad and its super fun! The controls were tricky to setup probably because things were double mapped to tilt but the tilt works well now and its super fun to play!  
	- THe replays are amazing because you can pause them and look from different camera angles mid-replay!  I got 1st place on my first race!
	- its really cool although after a few minutes of thinking about it, its just clumsy enough that I dont feel drawn to play it quite a bit again
* Geometry Wars 7/20/2020
	- Works great and its lots of fun!  The backgrounds are 3d compared to the playfield although theres not vast depth in the playfield (as is the nature of this game) but there is depth especially when the waviness happens and its really cool to see that!  it plays excellent with classic controller.  Note: right now the stroke on all of the lines is thick which makes it look ... weird.  everything still works, but its all kidn of blurry as a result.  Let me try adjusting some graphics options.  Most of the game even the text is made of little vectors so if somehwo the stroke is changed it will look crisp again.  I was kind of hoping it would be super high resolution but who knows if that will work.  At native resolution it looks bad.  Enable wireframe looks pretty interesting actually.  I wasnt able to change the stroke size in VR.  its not amazing in VR for any particular reason, although in the menu it is pretty cool to look around and see the starfield.  I wonder what its like in non-vr dolphin?  or in 3d?
	- Wierd ... in non-vr dolphin I dont think the stroke is too big, but whats weird is I can't tell for sure.  if I get motivated I'll take screenshots of both.  Otoh I'm not that motivated.  I beat the hell out of this game back in the day and I'm not motivated to do it again.
* Klonoa 7/22/2020 DolphinVR
	- Somehow without any hacks I got to spend maybe 30 seconds jumping around in the awesome 3d world and it was like I was playing with toys and it was so damn cool!  There was a lot of culling so adding the culling seemed to cause problems.  Regardless after that 30s I picked up a powerup or something and the hud had to reassert itself and block the main game view and the game became unplayable unfortunately.  Basically you can only walk a few feet to the right and then the mirror-hud blocks the game view.  Wait theres an option for HUD on top in VR settings ... maybe that will fix it?  Update: with some tweaking I got it mostly playable: I put hud 3d closer to 0 and the two hud checkboxes off and hud distance to 10 metres.  Now theres still a hud but its back a ways and therefore not getting in between the player and the camera.  Theres still another smaller hud in the top left of the camera fustrum that is annoying but its not directly in the way of the player
	- Update!  Set hud thickness to 10000 removes all of the HUD problems!!! I'm going to make that default and see if that fixes it with BUrnout 2.  In the process of doing this I also turned off reprojection for Dolphin in SteamVR application specific settings.  Now it looks awesome and seems totally playable!
	- Now it works to near perfection and its so damn cool to look around and see the whole level laid out to the sides and around you.  this is awesome #Again
	- The windmill coming at you in the first level after the tower is really a sight.  The water reflections are a bit weird since they are based on what hte camera is seeing so when I move my head the reflections change.  Thats slightly glitchy but fine.  The game is very playable and fun.  It even gives me a fear of heights when I got up to the top of the first peak!  WOW Theres an awesome VR ROller coaster on level 2!  The cutscenes are great because you can look all around while they're talking and see everything thats going on.  Playing like this gives you near instant situational awareness about the 3 dimensions of the level layout where in a screen you have to construct it in your head, here you look around and immediately know roughly what is there and where you could go. It makes it easier to imagine being there and makes the game levels instantly partially familiar.  Its not easy to navigate and many of the enemies aren't spawned yet and you still have to solve all of the puzzles.  Its just so superior tohaving a screen.  Screens are still awesome too though for different reasons.  The soundtrack here is awesome. The boss battle music is really cool.

* Epic Mickey 7/22/2020 DolphinVR
	- VR didnt work.  This really doesnt work its an unplayable mess in VR but wow the intro videos are amazing, they are dark and legitimately scary in a typically happy go lucky setting and it looks to me like it will be a really cool game when I get it working well.  
	- Now I'm trying it in Dolphin and as long as I start it without Anisotropic filtering on the cinematics work just fine.  Wait ... right as I'm typing this they slowed to a crawl.  30fps down to 10fps.  Lets just wait a few minutes and see if after the cinematic is over we can start playing at full speed? Something I'm setting is keeping it slow.  Its choppy even in gameplay.
	- Regarding the setting its pretty dark and bad ass.  I have a hard time relating to Mickey in this setting but I suspect it would grow on me.  I loved the castle of illusion as a kid because it was actually a beatable game and I like to re-live that sometimes but not because I can totally relate to mickey especially like this.  OMG its 16h long?  No thanks honestly.  thats not for me.  Maybe if I was totally in the mood someday.
	- Well I give up on this game.  I got stuck with me being stuck and the narrator saying over and over that the paint and thinner were powerful tools and it said it so often I couldn't even get my controls working.  Mickey wouldnt move at all so something was wrong there was an empty gear and I couldn't paint or fill anything in it all just splashed.  That pissed me right off, but I wasn't in the mood after figuring out that its 16h long which is way to long for me to play something like this, although it sounds like thats a lot of great gameplay and if you like it then this is probably an excellent game for a lot of people and reports are that with some tweaking it works well in dolphin.  With the terrible framerate and problems Im not interested anymore.   
* Donkey Kong Country Returns 7/22/2020 DolphinVR
	- VR Didn't work. This loosk really cool and would be amazing if it had culling codes.  unfortunately it doesnt and the background is glitched AND DK himself disappears and the controls expect you to shake both wiimote and nunchuk a lot which I dont have configured and dont know which config to pick.
	- 3D SBS Works well.  I had to set motion control to move the nunchuk -50 and the wiimote to +50 when I hit the x button.  Wow actually the 3d parallax levels in this game with the awesome backgrounds is pretty stunning on this game.  Advantage of using configurable controls is I dont have to shake the wiimote and nunchuck like they want me to, I just hit a button.  its more convenient and precise.  there are tons of depth effects here too as if it was made for stereoscopic honestly.  just this first level is one of the best 3d in a 2d platformer I've played. I'm losing some frames with some of the fancier effects on.  It works so great I played through three levels.  I'm very impressed.  I love smashing the ground and I love the 3d effects.  I remember loving those even in 2d on the wii back in the day.  at this point I dont know if I want to play it again but its really good and I'm glad its there.
* New Super Mario Bros Wii 7/22/2020 DolphinVR
	- Well VR is kind of a mess with everything is dark but you know what I love is seeing how the game works behind the scenes, certain elements are off to the side and others below the main play area and you can see those here which I think is really bad ass.
	- Ok well now that I am running in Dolphin proper wow it seems to work flawlessly and looks so damn incredible and clear its gorgeous!   I tried the Auto-toon post processing effect and its super fun!  The graphics are awesome but in fact with this kind of stark clarity it makes clear what is tiles or sprites and what is 3d and it ends up looking a little funny, but c'est la vie with a 2008 game.  I remember loving this game and taking it to my parents and playing and beating it over Christmas break with my sister and ex and it was a blast.  I remember like the first time we got to the final castle one of my proudest moments was running the last little section when the other two died off and it was just me in a clutch moment and I jumped and bounced and slid and made it to bowser and beat him it was some kind of race or something to win the game.  I'm having trouble making the controller shake.  Ok I got it, some combination of making it a stronger shake (50) and all three axes mapped and getting the frequency right.  It might be a little bit different with every game honestly.
* Trackmania Wii 7/22/2020 DolphinVR
	- OMG This works so great in VR!  Its so much fun and exciting!  I use the control profile Xbox Nunchuk Remote Wiimote and the right stick to select menu items.  it works great!  Then I tried Xbox Classic Controller and it works pretty good (the menus dont always update graphically but you can just hit start and get around it usually) but boy its so much fun!  I got an author medal!!!  Wow and it looks a lot deeper than the VR mode in turbo on PC.  the graphics arent as good as turbo and there are some glitches for sure (then again there are some in turbo too!) but theres tons of awesome courses, enormous speed, and puzzle courses and just tons to do.  This game is packed and fantastic and thrilling 
	- 1/15/2021 Dolphin3DSBS one thing about this is you can play first person teh whole time.  I just played for 15min and got some motion sickness but its really cool even in 3d and not in VR.  Its really c ool.  the track editor is awesome too I dont know how they made it so easy to use on wii.  I might have had fun fiddling with that for a long time.  wow how cool.  I dont know about playing it again though.  the vr one is higher resolution even if its 3rd person.  no complaints here just not totally motivated I guess its just not a peak experience for me right now even though its great.
* Epic Mickey 2 7/22/2020 DolphinVR
	- VR didnt work.  Yes exactly the same as the previous Epic Mickey entry.
* Bit Trip Complete 7/22/2020 DolphinVR
	- This works pretty good in VR.  The menus are a little wonky but I think with the right control xbox mapping they would be pretty good.  I played some beat and its as hard as I remember and unforgiving but really cool still and I would love to be good enough at it to get pretty far. The tilt controls with xbox stick worked ok believe it or not.  There might be some mapping that could specifically set to different points on the board which would be pretty cool.  I wonder what the 3ds controls woudl be and if that game would work better in 3d than this does in VR?
	- One really cool thing is you can see clearly how they did the scene switching they just left the border down below the screen and the background is actually pretty far back behind and I love to see behind the scenes like this and all the tricks they do.R
	- Runner is totally awesome!  You can see the level as they build it just off to the right of the screen and you can see the backgrounds and some of the cool video tricks that they use!  Its great!  and it works and plays perfectly and its a lot of fun. More fun and less frustrating than I remember (well ok I'm stil on an easy level so ...)  One of the coolest things about these games is how they merge the existing music and add layers to make the game more exciting and it does a fantastic job.  Burnout 2 does that when you boost! #Again  Haha something funny happened! The boss threw four ufos into the sky and I knew they were about to come down so I watched them go up up up and then died because the game just sent them up off screen and sent other ones down from offscreen to illusion that they were the same!  I tricked myself :) Hey I beat the whole world 1!  that last boss level was tough and I got all but the final kick once and then had to do it many more times before I finally beat it.  yay.  This is great.  The soundtrack is so hoppin too.
* Driver San Francisco 7/22/2020 DolphinVR 
	- Intro almost unwatchable and UI is pretty messed up.  Yeah the game is unplayable too.
	- even 3D SBS it had a window popup with a read error and then when I ignored that it got stuck later ... I dont remember why.  I saw a little graphics and lost all motivation.  It might work but I dont care anymore.  
* Dead Space Extraction 7/22/2020 DolphinVR
	- Well it doesnt seem to run.  Everything is super dark the cutscenes arent there at all (and there are a lot in this game) and even the apparent gameplay is super dark.  at least the pointing worked ok.
	- Ok I'm going for it in Dolphin 3D SBS.  the opening scene has broken static on half of each side of the screen.  The 3d is actually messed up actually.  On the right eye there are two stereo images almost anaglyph but not.  Ok that was just a one time glitch I think and after changing sbs settings and back its working great.  This is an amazing immersive game which is kind of one big cutscene and its really cool.  Now controls matter a lot here and the centered cursor moving off to the side works just fine, but its not quite accurate enough for me really.  I'm going to try using it not centered then maybe the mouse to see if they are better.
	- I got through the first chapter wihth the 'relative input' on the point settings in motion simulation.  I also had to set button x to left tilt to activate secondary weapons functions and button a to shake the wiimote and the nunchuck.  My triggers are a and b on the right and z and c on the left and the right stick is the point control and the left is the nunchuck stick.  afaik all commands are mapped at least I was able to get through chapter one well.  Note: I dont know how to switch weapons, that wasn't clear from the tutorial.  The 3d is great in this game although the cursor appears stereo unless I specifically focus on it, if I lower convergence to 0 it isnt stereo anymore but then the 3d doesnt really look right.  I had skip efb enabled and hacks/texture cache set to fast (although someone else said to set it to safe) #Again
* Gunblade NY & La Machine Guns 7/22/2020 DolphinVR
	- This works great actually!  The shooting is great and fun. It threatened to make me motion sick since its a flying on rails shooter through the city but that also made it really cool. The 3d and vr looked and worked fantastic.  The shooting felt good and the reticle felt snappy.  For some reason it didn't always seem to shoot quite where I wanted based on where the reticle was probably that has to do with how the gun is aligned with the screen perhaps if I held it in the middle or stable it would work better, the weird thing is that didnt stop me from taking down the enemies just from aiming and hitting them blind.  It should be noted that with a game like this you can only shoot within the recognized screen bounds which in this game are pretty clear based on a border above and below.  Theres an outline option in the vr options for this: Show 2D Screen Box.  Gotta take a break for a while because of motion sickness.  Also the angle of the camera was wonky.  perhaps read camera angles in teh VR menu would help with this?  I got 1st ranking in the first mission 
	- Using Dead Space controls this is really fun actually.  Aiming with out centering seems to work real well although I can tell it might get harder later on when I'm expected to hit targets on several sides of the screen quickly.  Mouse might work better.  Its real choppy but I wonder if I can fix that.  I like how you can juggle the people to make chain combos.  OH!  Graphics/hacks/texture cache fast sped it all right up to full speed.  Theres a big DAMAGE sign in the middle of the screen.  oh no not fast.  it needs to be in the middle.  When it was fast the ui didnt work.  Yeah now its playing real smooth with only little cutscenes slowing down a hair.  Its really fun!  Cristi and me played this in Las Vegas at a freeplay arcade on a terrible monitor so it was kind of hard to see.  It was a Las Vegas Setting actually! Something I really like about this game is how when you are targeting an enemy even if the camera rotates around that enemy stays right in your sights for the most part so you can keep shooting in the same place.  After several continues I ran out of time and mission failed.  I still got #1 score!  Oh wow with the mouse I did even way better!  It wasn't necessarily the same kind of fun for some reason.  This is a fantastic game though and I could totally beat this.  The 3D should be really cool too like space harrier kind of.  #Again
	- update 1/14/2020 playing in dolphin in 3DSBS with wiimote.  Game is a slideshow. What did I do to speed it up before????  I dont know its at like 24fps.  now the demo for gunblade ny is at <1fps  THe demo is <1fps all the tiem so you have to click start before the demo starts.  Its confusing why thsi doesnt work anymore.  is it the wiimote?  I'm using the emulated wiimote now with disable efb vram copies and its at 20-30fps which is playable and slow motion so it might be more fun that way?   OH!  looks like disabling 'texture dumping' on advanced blasted it back up to 60fps!  Oh boy!  
	- Also with this game it loses connection with the wiimote in like 30s of it beign offscreen.  its not as easy to reestablish with this one either :(  I think thats just the low framerate now that I'm thinking about it.  it does make it impossible to debug though.
	- Ok now that I have this working its really cool!  its a pretty fair game too because the gunblade section I'm 2/3 way through the first mission just passed area 2 and only had to continue once.  you can shoot the projectiles.  the area 2 boss was tricky because you had to move around so much and the rocket wasnt shootable so you had to shoot hte guy shooting the rocket.  but some games like thsi arent fair and will hit you from almost out of nowhere anytime.  this isnt like that! 
	- On the final ship level of gunblade part 1 some of the 3d is so cool! the low poly water splash when you shoot the water is so amazing!!!  
	- throughout the whole gunblade game its wild how jumpy and tap dancy they are and how much breakdancing they do to avoid your bullets.  thats ok  its really fun! Hey I beat it! The final boss was the only point at which it got cheap and barely unavoidable to get hit.  I had to continue like 3 times.  prior to that it was just jumpiness and just got harder and they shot faster but not too fast to respond.  the 3d was awesome too!  
	- I will admit that the camera moves really fast so in 3d it can make the stomach turn a bit.
	- Unlimited continues as it should be!  this is so fun, and if I had gotten my wii shooting working right back in the day with no lag I would have loved this game.  I had too much lag and pointer jumping back then to consider my wii reliable which is sad.  Some other setup would have worked, even if that meant putting it on a different tv it would have been preferable.  #again #replay there is another gunblade to play plus the whole LA game
	- Wow 2 player is WAY better.  We played the gunblade NY easy scene and it was super fun took like 15 minutes and maybe 5 continues between us.  We unlocked a new gun too so its cool they added features like htat!
* Ghost Squad 7/22/2020 DolphinVR
	- the HUD is right in the way so hopefully I can checkbox it away.  Meanwhile the little bit of shooting that I did was really cool actually.  Theres tons of shakiness and frame loss in the menus when you move your head.  The menus are very small and get smaller so they arent readable.  There might be a 2d setting to shcange that or something.  No the hud wont go away and its not playable with that mirrored hud in the way.  
	- Wow this is really good.  Second only to time crisis I'd say.  I wish I had bought this back in teh day for the wii and Klonoa for the Wii (maybe I did) and also sin and punishment.  I felt in this game like part of an elite squad.  it was cool how many times you would roll and look under a chair and take out dudes that way.  I played with the gamepad and there were some clumsy parts about it, it was just a little slow as you would expect but still super fun, also I think it was more fun than clunky wii remote aiming (since when I used wii remote back in the day it was not accurate and it was also slow).  reloading always took a while.  The sniping was super hard with slow reload.  The snipping of wires I pushed every button but there must have been some motion or pointing that I would have had to do.  I dont know about that part.   Its great.  #Again  I think I could beat every mission on this game.  The 3d was good and fun to play in for a while.
* Lego LotR 7/22/2020 DOlphinVR
	- The hud is in the way and its reflective.  Its in the way during the intro, but also in the first gameplay session its semitrans so technically you could play it but its also super annoying.  Perhaps that 3dmigoto might help but I'm not motivated enough to get this game working.  It was pretty cool seeing parts of it in VR.  I noticed during the intro that several characters were just tossed aside and together since it didnt matter since they were offscreen.  If you were super motivated you could play this by looking past the box borders and hud reflections.
	- Perfect emulation in SBS 3D its so coo. Its got me in this movie.  You know I'm pretty sure I played this or rented it back in the day for the wii, but I must have not been in the mood for it.  Its not compelling in its  own right like "Oh I want the gameplay of a lego combat game" although theres nothing wrong with it, its just a great way to tell a story with puzzles and combat and cutscenes and its awesome for those reasons.  The 3d is so cool a lot of it pops out of the screen like they hold the ring right up to your face and zoom in on people to inches away and sometimes look at huge 3d mountainscapes.  
	- It has lots of funny bits like when they are looking into the fireplace and sam drops a carrot down it and thats how they find him! Or how Frodo drops the one ring in his hot mug and thats what makes it glow haha.
	- Being picky about hte graphics its a rock solid 30fps but its a little doubled when turning the camera at a normal pace.   The character is not blurry or doubled at all, but the near background details are.
	- Controls seem to be wii nunchuck.  Throwing is pretty hard and tricky to get right.  It looks like its using the point relative controls.  Lets see if thats easier without point relative. 
	- For the aiming ... well ... if you first move the pointer in a circle for a second then it kind of settles into a controllable pattern.  right stick, dead zone 0, 10cm vertical, 15deg yaw pitch, no relative input.
	- Damn it crashed after a long time right after I made the mithril trowel in Bree and walked out of the blacksmiths house.  I was just thinking how I wanted to save.    It didn't lose too terribly much of my progress fortunately.
* Lord of the Rings: Aragorns Quest 7/22/2020 DolphinVR
	- Reflective HUD in the way. That seems to be the only problem.  The combat in this game looks awesome though.  Try it in 3d.  I like the story elements here too.
	- In 3D SBS it worked pretty good.  the upscaling didnt doo too much for some reason, and the controls were weird.  I figured out that it wanted me to swing the wiimote and mapped that to the stick and that worked ok for fighting.  There was enormous 5x slowdown during cutscenes (which were often) and it wasn't that exciting.  It wasn't shiny for me so I gave up and deleted it.

* Kirbys return to Dreamland 7/22/2020 DolphinVR
	- This is all kinds of messed up.  The depth is way out of alignment with the gameplay so you cant tell what ground you are walking on.  Apparently there are ways to get this working in VR in the subreddit but to me its not fresh or interesting enough atm.  Maybe in 3d.
	- Wow in 3D this has a lot in common with DKC and possibly Klonoa because its so beautiful with depth and parallax and amazing models that go in and out.  The graphics and playability are great and the emualtor seems rock solid 60fps.  There is a ton of innovation and a new interesting mechanic in each level which is one of the cool things about that kirby 3ds game too.  These seem like I would like them both about the same.  It looks so crystal clean like its a world full of plasticky or soft kids toys and construction papers and scrapbooking but all alive and crisp and perfectly lit and colorful and beautiful (and not grubby like actual kids toys - yuck)
* Excitebots 7/22/2020 DolphinVR
	- Same comments as Excite truck and it works great.  Maybe a bit choppier so I might want to mess with framerate.  works great and was fun. 
* Muramasa Demon Blade 8/9/2020 Dolphin
	- It works really well in dolphin in stereoscopic.  The hand drawn art is flat on its own but has lovely parallax depth and 
the art is beautiful at such a big size.  It plays perfectly with emulated classic controller although I arranged the 
buttons kind of like the gamecube buttons.  Its a super fun game and I am glad that it has up to jump.  I didnt realize but 
I think this game is why now playing amiga games up to jump isnt so foreign to me.  when I was playing them I wondered why all of a sudden it didnt seem weird and I remember that for the last few years it hasnt felt weird (and I havent played amiga in many years before that).  This game has a cool deep supernatural story, tons of amazing enormous boss battles (I beat the cyclops ogre on my second try) and difficult and interesting combat and tons of cool secrets (including some nearly naked hot tub scenes) I beat this in 2009 or so and loved every second.  I remember cool cityscapes and amazing boss battles in the clouds. This is a fantastic game and one of the best metroidvanias around and its highly recommended in SBS or regular (even regular on a big screen would be bad ass, or you could just add a touch of depth and it would be really cool too.  Its not shiny for me right now but I had fun spending a half hour slashing through it.  Note: I played it on the harder combat mode and I thin its really cool that they have the options to do super sophisticated combat or simpler combat.  I don't remember which I picked back in the day but this was pretty interesting combat for sure and would be fun to learn and master and get really good at again.  Since its not shiny for me personally I dont think I will.  
	- Graphics: Polygons upscale but hand drawn pixel art doesnt.  its a nice resolution and everything is clear but its not super crisp and I heard there might be a ps3 remake or something that might be better for the high res graphics reason.  
* Pinball Hall of Fame Williams 8/9/2020 Dolphin
	- It works perfectly and is really cool.  I played the hell out of this on Wii so I dont know if I'll play this here but it worsk great. 
	- Upscaled it loosk super crisp the only complaint might be it seems like its only 30fps.  The stereoscopic is fantastic it looks deep and the tables look super realistic.  
	- Control work perfect (better than wii) map motion x of nunchuk to right stick left and wiimote to the right stick right and youve got it.  Map triggers to the B button and the Z button and youve got the flippers.  A button is used for menus so I mapped that to the A button on the controller.
* Pinball Hall of Fame Gottlieb 8/9/2020 Dolphin
	- Same as Williams except maybe a little clunkier?  Nudge only works with the wiimote shaking, the graphics arent as crisp.  But its fun.  it also requires that you unlock most of the tables there are only a few in free play and so you have to master the free play tables to play any of the others, there dont seem to be unlimited credits so you had better put some other tables into free play quickly or you will run out and have to reset the data?
* Shantae 3DS 8/9/2020 Citra
	- I kind of love the 2d with deep parallax that we have here. I have it set to 30% depth and now its at 40 lets see ifthats better or worse.  I love the game and beat it on 3ds proper (one of my favorites ever after zelda between worlds).  Right now I'm playing it with the sound coming from my speakers and in a huge theater room and theres something funny because for some reason its a little bit less taxing and tiring than playing the whole thing in VR.  Cant really explain that but there it is.  It gives me warm fuzzy feelings like virtual boy did back in the day, but for anyone reading this I'm not comparing them just see hints of what I loved about VB in the graphics presentation.  I moved it up to 60% depth and its great. 
	- on the first level there is one thing disconcerting: the screen shake due to explosions and earthquakes at full screen theater level is disconcerting.  the scrolling is just slightly jerky in the background which is in turn slightly disconverting, but any scene standing still it looks so damn cool and is a joy to just observe the things in the background and foreground bouncing and moving and swaying.  Its all so beautiful.  
* Tomba PSX 8/9/2020 Retroarch
	- This is such a cool game.  Once I got it working in Retroarch in 3D it drew me in quick.  
	- Complaints about the gameplay?  Not many.  The jumping is odd, there is a tough swinging jump in the second part of the first level that I think its way too demanding on your platforming and aiming from swinging.  If it didn't hurt you when you missed I would mostly forgive it but this has just run through 2 lives for me one hit at a time and I'm just now figuring out that you have to precisely hold up right to jump off and then let go of it when you hit the other pole.  Its difficult control-scheme-specific platforming on the first level and I think thats kind of silly.  Update: nope even that doesnt work.  I've tried this 12 times and dont know exactly how to make this jump.  I'm starting to think you cant even do it.  That they expect you to go in the foreground instead.  
* Shovel Knight 8/9/2020 Citra
	- This is so damn cool.  the controls are amazing, the continue structure is perfect (a penalty for dying, or replay to recover it!) 
	- I've got the depth set to 90 and the parallax depth looks amazing!  I think I'll lower it so I dont have to refocus so much. There its at 50 and nice.  Even lower looks really cool.  I love how the waterfall textures are much deeper in the cave than the regular textures.
	- I've got the audio set to my speaker not the headphones and it make sme feel less isolated, which at the moment I prefer.  Wonderful soundtrack.  So catchy! Theres knockback but not too much. 
	-   Maybe the 2nd main level is a little too hard platforming wise imho.  This is not a game for beginners by any stretch.  You have to train your platforming skills elsewhere to make any real progress in thsi game.  Theres one part where you have to shovel jump on books and then get a limited time to jump across temporary small platforms with pits underneath or you die finally having to grab a ladder.   Thats on the second level.  I made it fine but recognized its difficulty.
	- 8/14 I havent played in a few days and I got to the metal whale or whatever and the floaty underwater controls and the instant death spikes rubbed off a lot of shine tonight.  I dont feel so much like playing this anymore but its clearly a great game and maybe some day I'll want to come back to it.
* Ghost Squad PC Dolphin 1/12/2021
	- Previous experience in DolphinVR above
	- Dolphinbar and wiimotes 2players
		- This works great!  Dolphin works great with the dolphinbar and wiimote.
		- There are some quirks: Syncing the wiimote with the pc was not standard bluetooth sync because it expected a passsword.  but if i right click bt in the bottom right bar and 'add to personal area network' or something then ti works and you can just click right through the otherwise required password
		- hold down the sync button (the one on the right on the bar) and the sync in the battery of the controller) and they will sync.
		- then with ghost squad once i start the level it takes 60s or more to respond at the right speed to my wiimote
		- it doesnt work close up
		- it seems to work best like 4-5ft away?
	- once it worked it really worked well.  for me personally this has already worked better than My wii ever did but ive been thinking for a while now that maybe I never had my wii pointing working properly.  perhaps it was just a slow tv response problem.  Perhaps I didnt have anything plugged in wrong.  no it was always a jumpy pointer no matter what we did.  that should have been a red flag.  we would have thought it was way more fun if it had worked more solidly
	- Wow this game is great. You save your profile and can have a profile per player and that player gets a bunch of unlockables like extra weapons and outfits and stuff.  there are 3 scenarios but each has many multiple branching and unlockable paths.  The shooting is incredibly accurate and really fun.  I had way more fun with the rifle than the shotgun, otoh my forearm got pretty sore after 30min and i started to perform worse actually.
	- I played 2p with my stepson and we got really far we finished all 3 missions twice although we lost one or two and the whole thing worked great.  
	- Now I'm going to try dolphin sbs 3d with wiimote ... yes!!! it works so great and is super immersive!  ghost squad is in 3d and the bullets come flying right past your head its fantastic!!! it feels like an element of virtual reality.  I love it.  
		- I  have tried a big virtual tv probably 60" at 8ft away approx and its working great!  I'm using big screen for the sbs and using my personal screen instead of the theater screen.
		- I havent tried a full theater sized screen in VR, but I have a feeling it would work too.  Lets try it! WEll it works just fine!  obviously for this you have to have your wiimote pointed at your sensor bar while it seems to you to be looking at the theater screen.  the personal screen is better because it can be moved and that matters because my sensor bar is not front and center from where vr thinks the center of my play area is.  you can adjust the play area and the rotation of your view in vr but in big screen can only rotate by 15deg or so so its never quite on, with the personal screen you can place it precisely.
		- the cable cutting part which didnt work well when I played it in VR also didnt work well in 3d.  it was so close to your face that there was no way to see clearly.  Covering one eye didnt work and even when I thought it was working I clicked and it cut the wrong wire!!!  (off from where the pointer was from my perspective.  I had to guess by starting at the right and moving to the left.  I sort of passed.
		- THe sniping is harder for some reason in vr.
		- Ultimately this works but feels somewhat clumsy and adds a certain level of fatigue that wasnt there before and a certain level of ... imprecision?  its really cool for a few minutes seeing all the bullets come at you like that and feeling in the middle of it.  its just clumsy
		- OH!  I didtn recalibrate the shooting!  Maybe I should.  lets see yeah thats better somewhat.  
		- probably prefer it on the monitor but seeing it in 3d is really cool.
		- note the 3d in a theater is super duper immersive btw
* Donkey Kong Country Returns 1/12/2021
	- wow this is so cool in 3D!  I love it!
	- Wiht the real wiimote it works great but just like with the ghost squad game it doesnt work until after like 60s and then the input lag settles down.  its weird but totally workable.
	- I have it on continuous scan for wiimotes but whiel I was fiddling with graphics the wiimotes became disabled, I wasnt fiddling for more than 2 min and the wiimote wasnt off and the batteries werent dead, but it wouldnt find it again after that and I had to shut it off.
	- the 2.5d in thsi is one of the best ever.  its fantastic.  enemies often come flying at the screen and there is depth everywhere and cool things going on in the background.  its awesome!
	- first time I ran it it was a slideshow. may be scaled efb copy fixed that?  it does seem to need a relatively low internal resolution.  running it at 8x is a little choppy.  Running at 3x is ... 
	- I feel like theres a little bit of input lag no matter what.  let me go to native res.  - wow native internal resolution looks so much worse than 
	- OH!  The personal screen in big screen is lagged! the theater screen is snappier.  hmm interesting.  I have the impression that even the theater screen has noticeable lag for me now that I'm thinking about it.  maybe I can use something other than bigscreen for the sbs?  I used to have some ovr programs maybe they would work and be snappier?
* Sin and Punishment Dolphin 3DSBS 1/13/2021
	- Gameplay
		- in the turtle in a tunnel level I hated the part about asteroids.  I dont know how to get past that part without taking a bunch of damage.  I beat it somehow though. 
		- I cranked up the 3d real deep for this turtle in a tunnel level and it was really cool to play i n 3d.  probably depthat 75%
		- This is really cool.  Now i'm in a water tunnel.  the depth in this level is pretty intense so i'm lowering it to 33% or so  (the labels arent there for some reason).  
		- I'm back in a tunnel with like a fire generator in it and now I think I'll increase the 3d depth to 60 or so
		- This game is much more suited to this.  there are no quicktime split millisecond shooting required.  because of the inherent slop of the wiimote on a huge screen and add in the slight extra lag (its not bad) those kinds of things are hard like in ghost squad.  this doesnt require that and feel smore comfortable and natural adn like I could play this whole game.   I guess its probably due to the auto aim feature too.
		- wii and gc games arent meant for this though.  In a game designed for VR every piece will make sense in the 3d space.  for a game like these games which arent, some pieces were designed knowing that it would be in 2d and sometimes that causes problems.  in this game its really not any problem. In ghost squad yeah that cable cutting was too hard.  The sniping was a bit too hard too in vr. 

		- So I think I love this mode, as a compliment to the regular wii mode on flat screen.  They are both different great ways of experiencing games: sometimes with the added agency and precision and solidity of flat screen, sometiems with the added immersion of VR
		- this game in particular I think feels better in VR.
		- there are fuzzies on the front of the screen in this game sometimes .. probably to make a certain effect.  water or fire or something.  I wonder if those are there in the clear sky lveles?
		- this is the best space harrier like game ever.  well space harrier is pretty dope tbh tho
		- For a non VR native game this is a 9/10.  Totally playable and great
		- Soemtimes the depth slighlyt betrays the gameplay: I think the asteroid part I was annoyed with eaerlier was annoying because the asteroids appeared on a layer behind the player to a 2d screen you wouldnt notice.  I think I was supposed to shoot AROUND the player or something like that where I was still trying to shoot at the asteroids directly.  not sure, but then in the whale level they are behind the player according to my depth perception but they still hti the player.  those are the minimal kind of things that are a 'thing' in thsi game.
		- this game is awesome.  I just unlocked level 2 on easy mode.  I'm on level 3 on easy mode and the first level has converted this same control scheme totally effortlessly into a deep 2.5d side scrolling shooter its so cool! wow and it becomes a beat em up at the same time!
		- the samurai girl boss is really hard.  mostly jsut because its not obvious what to do and when you dont do it you get killed quick.  probably took me 7or8 tries.  
		- level 4? the cemetery level is so cool.  the heads especially are really cool looking and remind me of space harrier.  then the boss is amazing when he jumps over your head and launches down at you!  The boss at the end the bird lady in the lake is so damn cool with beautiful 3d birds flying out of her stick.
		- At the dolphin forums it says to avoid minor graphic bugs store efb copies to texture only to off.  I did that but then the whole game slowed to a crawl.  I turned scaled efb copy off and that didnt fix the top left corner square.  
		- level 5 the desert cat and desert eagle are freaking amazing!!!this level is amazing in 3d because you are moving across the desert so fast! and then OMG combination??? oh holy shitballs!!!  also I loved the setpiece where there were these three huge formations of v wing fighters flying over you and you could take them out so sort of easily.  it was really fun to take them out, satisfying to shoot them and blow them up but also I thought itw as a really cool patterns eeing them like that.
		- am I stuck?  I am on the train.  Theres a funny looking rear view mirror in the middle of the top of the screen.  I got a few cars in and theres no enemies and nothing to shoot and no where to go.  I guess I can fly and die and see if it works next time?  nope I died and tried again and igured out i just had to hit a special lever to separate cars.  not obvious perhaps because of the 3d or just nto that obvious I thought it was a hose, but just fine. 
		- the final boss battle is cool and all but every one of this part is super hard. Theres no flow its just die die die win die die die die win.   thats ok I guess but the track level with the lava and ths level arent like making me thikg "wow I want to play this and these parts again" the earlier levels DID make me feel thta.
		- on the last stage they had what was called a perfect bonus.  wtf?  perfect?  i got by with a sliver of life left.  how could you do that?  well I dont know but its really fun anyway.
		- the whole game on this mode (easy I believe) was excellently balanced for someone like me.  I got through most of the game with just a little bit of life left on my first try, then they gave me a life refill and a continue.  A few bosses took me a bit to figure out their patterns and thats kind of fun.  there werent parts that were way too hard, when I died (as long as I knew how to win) it was usually close so the balance was near perfect.  831,800 destroyed 505.	
		- the credits sequence was great with a cool original song that made it epic.  after that it said "you can now play stage 7 from the stage select menu" and I thought ... nope!  haha  maybe I would like it more now thta I knwo what to do.
		- Oh! i'm starting a new game and it says that isa is manual mode and kachi is autolock mode.  that matteers a lot I think ... I wonder about 2p can  you both play with autolock?  Nope it doesnt matter.  I just played stage 1 entirely and got 7mil and didnt die without autolock.  I'm glad autolock is there but there were so many times when it wasnt shooting at what I wanted.  I'm sure some bosses will be harder without it but there is still optional lock manual lock and this is just a fantastic game.
		- oh yeah something else cool : in the first keepers tunnel the turtle guy hes shooting stars at you in a circle swirl pattern and whats cool is visually my depth perception actually helps with this (and probably other parts too) and helps me see instantly and effortlessly which ones are closest and therefore should be dealt with first.
	- Game Structure
		- This game has a level select after you beat certain levels.  i think thats awesome!
		- I died on the boss but since I had hit a checkpoint I started off at that.  its real fair.
		- i'm playing on easy.
	- This is a really cool game.  The bosses kind of piss me off becuase its not clear how to avoid the shots but it doesnt seem too unfair and does seem like theres a way to beat each boss without getting hit or much.  
	- #again #peakexperience
* Dolphin with dolphinbar and wiimotes
		- Now while i was trying to get that working the wii remote disconnected and in dolphin theres no way to reconnect afaik. Ok if you go into dolphin and hit refresh it doesnt hlep.  if you turn off the wiimote in the controller options (set it to none) then back to wiimote then it vibrates and you are mostly back in business.  apparently alt+f5 might help reconnect? Update: Give it 60s.  I think most of the refresh that seemed to work was actually just ... waiting
		- Every time you switch out and back to the emulator it takes its few seconds to come up to speed again.  thats weird but ok.  that happened in ghostsquad and sinandpunishment
		- I looked up a code for re umbrella, then put it in by right click properties for the game in the gecko ttab, then i saw a button 'download codes' and 3 seconds later there were a bunch of codes there!!!
		- One thing about some of these games is sometimes the shadows dont show up at the right depth so they kind of stick out.  Also some of the skies and waters and it is certainly disconcerting at first.  I'm 98% used to it, it catches my eye for an instant and then I look past it so to speak.  
		- Some of these shooting games were a let down for me because they were so hard, partially because my wii wasnt setup right so all shooting was 'off' and I was used to the guncon or so I thought much more accurate (VR is so much more accurate and awesome actually).  And righ tnow its very accurate even though its still not accurate in the way the original guncon was accurate; its different.  The original guncon you could look down the sight of the gun eye to sight to screen and hit that point on the screen in the game.  with wiimote tech its totally different BUT STILL ACCURATE and super controllable: its about flicks of the wrist from a centerpoint and getting used to at a certain distance from teh screen how much of a flick moves the cursor to that point on the screen.  
		- back then I had significant jitter and jumpiness on my wii maybe because it was setup wrong and maybe because there was led interference or something to the degree that there was basically never a time when it would stay still.  On this system I can hold it in place and it stays in place like a rock unless you are aiming from far below and up and near the bottom of the screen hten it jitters a little bit. Also I probably always tried to play from too far away - the times I played from up close like mario galaxy were best though even then I was playing off center from below, also I think my tv had 100+ms lag or whatever it was it was noticeable and it didnt feel fresh.  now with this system though not PERFECT it feels fresh.  I admit though I wouldnt want to play hogans alley on NES or a nother game that required super split second accurate shooting as a mechanic that wouldnt be that much fun.  I just never got it working back then to the point where it felt at all like I could trust hte shooting.  part of that is me psychologically not understanding the tech differences and expecting guncon like shooting when that was just literally not in the cards and a part of it is me not having things setup right.  All of that combined low key killed my enjoyment of tons of wii games for me. I didnt realize it at the time but they kind of scared me because i could never trust them and could never feel any real significant level of success.  
		- in RE4 when my mote ran out of batts well ... I was aiming and shooting and it just kept doing that and before I could change the batteries and re sync it had beat the first phase of the boss lol
		- Sometimes it gets jumpy on parts of the screen (esp on the bottom) but just now I angled the monitor down just a few degrees and it made a big difference and is totally solid screenwide now.  I wonder if the bottom of the sensor bar doesnt quite show the led at the correct angles?  I wonder if it was upside down or if the sensor bar was angled a little forward toward the player if that might help or maybe even nearly 90deg?  or I wonder if it was on the bottom of the tv instead of the top?  Regardless its rock solid atm!  
		- Update: Its rock solid from certain distances and not from others.  Get 6-12 inches too close and its jumpy in parts.  back up that amount and its rock solid again.
		- the wiimote nunchuk that I have here when doing sniping in RE4 is shitty to aim.  Moving around it is fine.  I wonder if its aftermarket crappy?  I dont know or how to tell.  Update: this might be a configuration thing in dolphin.  I might be able to make it much more sensitive and therefore more fun.
		- I heard a rumor you can use a ps4 or xbox controlelr as a nunchuk which would be great because the sticks on those are so much better
		- Right click the game and open save folder to see the gamesaves.  They are tiny for example for RE4 they are 64k each.
		- Tearing.  You know whats interesting almost every game that has any 2d screens has some tearing in the 2d.  La mulana has some.  its tearing between tiles perhaps because of their slightly askew precision placement on screen but it doesnt show up if its not upscaled.
* SBS 3D Options: BigScreen VirtualDesktop and OVRToolkit
	- bigscreen
		- Ive got it working in the apartment in big screen and it works really well.  It was a lot of fun.  These games have little glitches though.  This one has a square on the top left for soem reason.  There might be a code I can find on reddit to remove that.   it wasnt a playabililty issue.  
		- now im in retro cinema 3rd row from the back.  the apartment was kind of too bright.  - the bright light in this theater is annoying on the armrest but otherwise its better. 
		- i wish there could just be a screen.  
		- Something weird about doing this in VR its wearing me out.  I'm getting some kind of fatigue.  I felt like I could play for a long time flat screen.  Then as soon as I try to get the VR working my back gets sore and my mind gets pissed off.  3d monitor/tv that read SBS signals might be optimal actually ... 
		- update: i'm not so sore now that I'm not so pissed off.  I probably started sore.  
		- Another weird thing is in big screen I'm always in a seat so... if I move my chair around to get further from the actual screen so it aims better well ... i'm behind the seat and it shows up in my lower peripheral vision.
	- OVRToolkit: I tried to use ovrtoolkit and what a piece of shit.  i bet it works perfect with Vive, and I bet theres 5 things I'm doing wrong but it says to do things and it wont fucking do them.  There was a screen a few inches from my face the whole time.  icoudlnt move it.  I couldnt resize it.  the tutorial I was trying to run through told me to do things that werent there or werent obvious. the final straw was "grip this window to move it" and that just refused to work.  pissed me off.  I'm not totally burned on it but boy am I pissed right now.
			- Next day: its been 'running' all night since last night which is bs.  I dont know how to quit it actually.  launching it doesnt launch wmr anymore so it doesnt work well.  if you launch wmr, then launch steam vr, then at least it works somewhat.  
			- I cant use it without activating things in the game Im also in, whetehr thats steamvr or some game. 
			- The UI got really far from the controller but on the gui on the computer I can reset ui location and that worked.
			- it says if you click both grips it goes into edit mode.  well I did see a slight blink that said something about edit mode but I dotn know what it said and I dont know if iam in edit mode. 
			- now also occasionally I can see a yellow highlight around the window which I think means its like selected and maybe then I can move it around because I still cant move the window around.
			- the 'tracked device' is what the windows are locked to and so I set it to x and then they are stationary which is best for now
			- one cool thing about this is how stable the mouse pointer is when you are using it.  its impressive and nice. 
			- ok I've figured out enough that the only way I know how to move the window is with 'tracked device' but that worked ok and I was able to set a screen to exactly the position of my monitor and then I can move away from it or near it as desired which is nice.  
			- with this its working well enough I guess but when it goes into SBS mode ... its not wide enough :( its not stretching the screen like it should.  in big screen its stretched perfectly so the aspect ratio is maintained. 
			- it says theres a way to resize the window with the trackpads or the grips but I cant do either one.  
			- I think part of the problem with this is the game input blocking doesnt work now. 
	- lets try virtual desktop now
		- yeah this works best by far. it als has half sbs and full sbs.  thats missing from ovrtoolkit
		- virtual desktop has a cool thing that specifies just how much latency is in the hmd at any time.  in my case it was 30.8ms.  not bad.  better not play punch out in there but thats not bad at all.
	- As of 1/28/2021 I'm often sick by watching some of these games in 3DSBS.  At least 3D ones still make me motion sick.  RE4 in particular ran at 30fps and probably needs to run at 90, plus theres constant spinning around the camera as a part of gameplay.  Other games might work better, and I wonder if it would be less motion sick in vr?
	- I found out that ripping a 5 min 3dsbs video with nvidia and then compressing it to 1280x720 at 90peakfps h.264 looks pretty good when it comes out the other end.  I am trying 90constantfps rn.
	- How to know if SBS is supported without headset on?  Turn in on in 2D mode and crank up the depth and swap eyes and look for ANY change. 
	- Sound: FIXED When I'm in VR the sound works great.  When I'm out of VR the sound works great.  When I'm in VR but then want to switch back to desktop ... Dolphin seems to have decided to send the sound somewhere that doesnt exist anymore and no sound settings can change that.  But ... do you know what can?  Hit the X on the game window to threaten to close the game then click no to go back to the game.  It resets it!  
* Medal of Honor heroes 2 Wii Dolphin 1/14/2021
	- Crashes before it starts.  did it twice.  I give up.
	- the cutscenes were strangely interlaced and didnt look right. 
* Resident evil Umbrella Chronicles wii 1/14/2021
	- I had this and bought it brand new probably the day it came out and was so excited.  It was a let down for me because it was so hard, partially because my wii wasnt setup right so all shooting was 'off' and I was used to the guncon or so I thought much more accurate (VR is so much more accurate and awesome actually).  I remember getting a ways in and then getting stuck on a boss and not having fun anymore.  
	- I'm playing on easy mode and I died on the first boss but I didnt understand the pattern so thats ok.  I wonder if 10 yrs ago when I bought this if I understood that bosses had patterns liek this back then?  One thing I dont like at all is those leeches, you can't be reliably expected to hit sharpshooter targets over and over again as ahorde attacks you, but fortunately in this game you have the knife easy to access and slash them off after theve slurped onto you but before they actually hurt you. 
	- Lots of problems with the wiimote being super slow at first.   If I go into the wii menu and train it by shaking it then it gets better quick enough.
	- SBS3D its really good.  There are no artifacts that I can see and the whole thing was made in a mature 3d engine so it works great.  The newer the game the more it works in 3d since the more they were using mature 3d engines without 2d bandaids.
	- the sky is still closer than it should be visually.  not a big deal but interesting and thats been true in other games.
	- Easy mode should be easier.  It should lower the 10 hit leech monsters to 3-4 hits and the damage should be halved.  Its fun as it is and so far I dont mind the challenge, but if some friends get together and choose easy mode and want to have a fun party night, they cant.  There arent many games where they can.  If they could pick up right where they left off with unlimited continues that would be different, but with this you have to replay parts, and on level 2 I shouldnt have to try really hard to hit small quickly moving arms before they hit me, I shouldnt be running out of ammo, I shouldnt be dying many times.  Maybe on the final level and boss.  The difficulty of level 2 is half what hte final level should be.  it should be 1/4.  reallly its just a few things they should have adjusted to be easier.  the monkeys shouldnt attack so quickly and so righ tat your feet so you cant see them.  There shouldnt be things where you have to aim perfectly to survive.  perfect aim for best scores sure.  
	- Level 2 was fun at the church or whatever with the bat boss.  The monkey cage part gave me some trouble and I tried every other checkpoint once or twice but the bat boss I got the 2nd time.  
	- Ok I'm on the boss at the end of level 3 which is some mutant leech dragon with a tiny sarlac mouth.  See this game y ou're supposed to aim for the mouth.  I can do that.  But it is annoying and demoralizing.  Aim for the mouth.  done it flies back a bit.  Then aim for the mouth again from that further distance? You cant hit it so it c omes back.  over and over.  if when its close you dont hit its mouth it hits you for a lot of damage.  I'm almost dead and my progress has been super super slow for the last few minutes.  I dont think I'll make it and I dont know if I could come up with a better strategy.  I beat it OS BARELY.  I was down to 2-3 shells.  when it was far away I just dont think I am personally able to hit that tiny mouth.  Its really frustrating being given a tool that is accurate at level 10 and being expected to hit a level 20.  They could have made the hit box on that twice as big and it would have been just as realistic and way more fun.  Especially for easy mode.
	- Chapter 1,2,3 13,21,17min and BCC, and 2/8,1/6,0/3 files
	- Its stupid that you have limited ammo on easy mode.  Im almost entirely out o fammo at the beginning of every mission.  
	- Its got some cool replay value with files to find and pick up if you can, and weapon upgrades.  I like that.  
	- OMG the snake in the library is so damn cool even in 3D.  I beat it on like the 2nd or 3rd try and JUST BARELy and it took a really long time.  I guess I need to get used to the bosses taking a long time in this game.
	- I looked up how many levels I had left and since I'm pretty bored with the friction in this game but I love the gameplay I turned on an unlimited ammo cheat I think it also gives me unlimited first aids but I havent tested that yet (update: nope I had to continue update: nope you get unlimited after you get just one if you have zero then it doesnt give you any).  This will make the experience more fun.
	- I understand that they want to make it as much a real resident evil game as they can but they cut out a huge portion of their audience with such little ammo and so much retreading when you make mistakes and with the long boss battles.  There is a lot to love about this game though and this code or some similar functionality would have lowered the barrier to entry
	- the snakes should have had larger hit boxes.  its like you have to hit their tiny heads.  #1 complaint about this game is the small hit boxes (sometimes like small snakes, monkeys, leechbosses,).  #2 complaint is the floppy unpredictable movements of the leechmen and other things like those esp combined with the camera jerkiness and movement.  Progress in a game like this should be about responding quickly and with a certain generous amount of precision and Leverage should be about precision headshots and crits and about multitasking and Survival and story should be about seeing things and responding during downtimes (lights, herbs, extra ammo).  #3 complaint could also be considered replay value: often you have to know what gun to have out because if you empty your smg or pistol into this enemy it will hit you.  if you havent been there already you cant survive.  i think thats cheap.
	- interesting that the quicktime events are different buttons every time to keep you on your toes.
	- The plant boss would have pissed me off so bad without unlimited ammo.  I almost died anyway.  Its not fun not knowing exactly what to shoot at and its not fun having no room for error with regard to precision.  I think there were arms that were waggling around in ways that cant possibly be predicted or planned ahead.  Same with both tyrant bosses.  I would have been so mad and it would have felt unpleasant.  
	- its funny when you walk past a zombie corpse and you just know that you're about to turn around and that corpse is goignto have reanimated and try to getcha so you empty a huge load of bullets into its head to make sure it doesnt get up again.  and then it does anyway
	- This is so much fun with unlimited smg ammo.  Its SUPER fun!  Its exciting, the friction is low, the baggage is gone.  I love being able to see what they made for us.  I love being a part of it.  I can still have a loss condition.  I would have been bummed had I abandoned this but I would have felt dumb NOT abandoning it.
	- I guess part of the difficulty is that I havent played through it yet. If you get lots of stars and upgrade your weapons properly that probably helps. 
	- I'm going to add the cheat for extra stars so I can make my smg amazing.  Its not that fun in games having ineffectual guns.  Like that batman and robin game pugman and chippants played it was great when it was properly upgraded with the rom hack.  The pistol should be upgradeable too!  The unlimited stars doesnt work right away.  It says I have 9999 but then it says I dont have enough ... maybe it will only trigger when I get a few more?  even the SMG is underpowered now in this carlos level.  I'm shooting 8 headshots and the zombie doesnt die.  if there are three I cant finish one off in the time it takes for one of the others to have attacked me.  I did just find out theres a submachinegunHP now.  
	- WHOA In the options it says camera can be controlled??? yeah it can with the stick a bit.
	- I figured out the crit thing and its stupid.  if you have enough time (which you never do) and if the enemy and the camera were totally still it would be really difficult to find the few pixels where you can hit them in the head to crit.  your cursor changes a tiny bit.  its absurd.  are some peoples arms so incredibly precise they can do that?  I know I can but only occasionally.  and nvm because although I think i've figured it out, and although I think I got like 5 crits it didnt register any of them as crits :(
	- I got an A grade in the city level! Racoons Destruction 1
	- as time goes on the game is giving you less and less time to grab weapons and herbs as your view scrolls around.  
	- you know what ... the crosshair is consistently off the hit point.  Like if you put the crosshair on a wall the bullet hole will appear to the right of the center of the crosshair.  Since I figured that out I have actually 
	- Racoons Destruction 2 has many areas where therea re tons of zombies where I am having fun but i have no idea how I would get through this with ammo starvation.  Remember this is supposed to be on EASY mode.
	- OK I finished all 9 of the maiin quests!  there are some subquests that look fun with the machine gun.  Also on the last level the grenades came in super handy.
	- Only 4 submissions left and its really good with these cheats.  I am just shaking my head at how disappointed I would be without the cheats.  I like trying things many times ... if its FUN but trying to hit tiny points that are vaguely indicated and are waving around constantly from a moving camera with limited ammo and trying to fend off hordes of zombies with ammo starvation is not fun for me.  Its interesting, challenging, and fulfilling once you beat it perhaps but not purely fun in the moment.  but with these cheats its super fun being a bad ass in a movie and actually doing the shooting. 
	- the wesker 2 submission final boss is cheap as hell and I dont know how to beat him without rockets and a few deaths.  I killed him with like 200 smg and 5 rockets and 1 death.
	- oh and let me reiterate in 3dsbs in my headset with virtual desktop this is legitimately BETTER.  I played for 3h today on pancake and now im in vr the lag is not noticeable, but more importantly aiming is legitimately EASIER and feels more first person and realistic and fun.  its fantastic.  I think it has to do with being able to focus less on the crosshair and more on the decal and particles made when it hits the wall or the face.  you can focus far past the crosshair.  That means when you want to use the crosshair its tricky because it doesnt hit where it is aiming.  Maybe also when I put the headset on I'm accidentally closer to the screen than before?  maybe thats why the aim is working?  I'm one square pillow plus 1 inch away from my desk. t he mote is probably 24" from the monitor.
	- OH Maybe thats why the crosshair is consistently off point like I said above?  maybe its still calculating stereo depth but only showing the left side of the screeN?  
	- Experiment: turn the depth up to 100 and play the game pancake mode and see if its off by more.  if so then report the bug: it shouldnt use the depth slider calculations if stereo mode is none.   I can do this next time i want to play pancake.  I'm deep in VR immersion atm.
	- Well I was about to say that it works perfectly with the following issues: 1. twice during cutscenes (not at all during gameplay) half of the screen is black cut across at an angle as if someone dropped a piece of black paper over half of the screen.  100% fixed when gameplay starts. 2. occasional slowdown (not often; once every 4 levels or so) but it messes with the wiimote and its best to whenever theres slowdown instantly hit home and let the wiimote catch up
	- THen I left it on while I went ot make dinner and when I got back the cameras were all like aimed at the ground or flipped or something?  Wow this is a big problem.  I deleted the save data (backup), and move the iso, and removed all of the patches, and everything I started a brand new save file with a brand new file and its still flipped camera!?!  its like pointed at the ground and you cant see your enemies.  I'm going to restart my computer.  oh theres a windows update ... maybe thats related?  the restart without update seems to have fixed it.  
	- Well now that its back working again the 3dsbs has changed somehow.  Its hurting my eyes in a way it didnt before :( like none of the gui is clear anymore.  AHA In virtual desktop I had it set to swap eyes or soemthing lets see if thtat fixes it.  yup that fixed it instantly.   I think it was pressing the wrong key oh!  like F10 changes eyes in virtual desktop and changes from stereo to monoscopic in dolphin .
	- I beat one level I'm trying to play without the hacks for one round and its hard and less satisfying or fun but I knew it would be.  I blew through about 1200 SMG rounds so its totally unsustainable and didnt get any files and died a few times and barely survived the final boss, but I did get better at the sankes as long as I hve lots of smg bullets and I got a C.  
	- WHOA I beat all of the levels that said new and a whole new level opened up!  Umbrellas end!  Now I have to play that one!
	- #again #peakexperience
	- This is a peak experience with the cheats.  It occurred to me that the cheat is making me more motivated to play the game through the original way or closer to it because using the cheats lets me experience the tropes and patterns of the game and learn how to deal with and approach the enemies nad battlaes and patterns and what to expect.  Now I dont have to figure all of that out at once and can concentrate more carefully on ammo management.  For example this game in many cases favors keeping the gun aimed in the center of the screen and then letting the camera do most of the work.  not always but often and thats just one example of a pattern that can be used on harder modes.
	- without the cheats its a great game just not a peak experience: easy mode is much too hard
	
* 3D Pixel Racing Wiiware 3D SBS 1/14/2021
	- What a hit game this should have been.  Its so much fun with tons of pixely style and the sound and racing and 3d are so great. 
	- The 3d was so amazing and fun!  I sucked so bad figuring out the controls but by the 3rd lap I think I did good and would like to race taht again.  
	- well I will get my shot soon since there was a 'fifo' error half way through my second lap and the controller wouldnt worka fter that.  emultaed wiimote sideways will work perfectly well next time.
	- What I wouldnt give to have 4 buddies around to play the hell out of this great party game.  
	- In 3D especically in first person mode I felt like I was there racing in the car in this cartoon world!
	- next day I give up. I did two races and it is cool to see but the ai is far too perfect. I  couldnt make any progress on any of them no matter how I did, which is of course realistic when racing against other drivers who know the track real well but not fun.  
	- I was still racing with the wiimote and it could still be cool
* Dead Space Extraction Wii Wiimote 1/15/2021
	- Playing with marshall and maybe no better co op game. the precise limb removal is awesome but whats amazing is this scene where htere are unlimited enemies attacking and we have to take turns hacking.  what is one player in 1p mode becomes 2p turn taking in co op. 
	- It was awesome shooting form the ship like milennium falcon.  AND in co op we each got one of the guns which was so perfect.  
	- This is one of the best co op games ever and a great movie like story game.
* Adventure Island The Beginning 1/16/2021
	- stereoscopic works great.  love the art style.  
	- Wiimote seems to work only if its all setup and on and connected before you start the game.  could have used emulated wiimote for this one tho. probably should have
	- Thres a shop and unlockable costumes!!!
	- The in game graphics look blurry to my eye in the backgroudn but the 3d is there and I bet they looked great at the time. I have a feeling they look about as good as new sup wii or so.  I bet to my 2007 eyes they would have looked fabulous and back then there was a dearth of platformers let alone 2.5d ones so I probably would have loved this even more.
	- Whats awesome about platformers in 3d is how uteterly instantly obvious it is what things are in your way and what arent ... what are you going to be able to hit or bump into and what is in the background even near background.  its no longer a thing at all.  unless that it s they put something dirty trick with putting something visually in the gbackground which you can hit but thats bad.
	- This is a much fairrer game thant he original.  its really fun. at least on level 1.  theres a boomerang. everything is obvious nothing is cheap.  theres a hatchet too.  id didnt even die when I started! 
	- I beat level 2 with out trouble.  In this one if you get hit it takes like 1/3 life doesnt kill you! Lets see what hte continue structure is like! Continue structure is forgiving!  i just continued from the same level!  no indication of limited continues either (which there shouldnt be).  It looks like your score is zeroed out and your items are removed perhaps.  maybe your collectables from the level are gone too?  AHA on level 4 if you get to the boss and then have to continue you have to play levle 4 again, if you have more lives you can retry the boss. 
	- interesting bug: in this game the shadow is to the left of the player in the left eye and to the right of the player in the right eye!  how weird!
	- on level 3 the platforming is already too hard ... have to make perfect long jumps that you didnt have to make in mario until like level 5 or 9 update: haha maybe not if you run you can clear it easily!.  
	- There is a boomerang, axe, and spear and they are all cool.  the boom seems most powerful
	- the springboard platforms work by holding down while you are landing on them like hold jump and you will fly high..  I was trying to sync my press with the bounce on the platform and thats not necessary or helpful.
	- the difficulty curve is too steep.  l evel 4 while still fun if you like retrying things over and over and getting better is pretty hard.  a level like this should be reserved for later but really thats just a sign of the difficulty to come. 
	- after level 4 in the first world is a world 7 difficulty boss its tough with several stages.  phase 1 6 hits or 9 with the axe or more and then phase 2 like 12 hits with the axe  and the enemy has a one hit kill attack in that phase.  I beat it after probably 15 tries.
	- the 8bitdo is LIGHT YEARS better than the sidewas wiimote.  lightyears.  the sideways wiimote sometimes barely registers buttons at least mine does.  it felt night and day different
	- its got some mini games for 1 or 2 players which is cool.  this would hve been a fantastic purchase back in the day and I know with unlimited continues I could beat this.
* Alien Crush Returns wii SBS3d 1/16/2021
	- Wow this has a story mode! I beat the first level and it has a separate high score list per level.  I love this
	- The physics on the upper part of level 1 right near the drain are bad and far too strong blink and its accelerated down unrealistically faster than falling straight down even.
	- Wow unlimited continues per level ! this is so great!
	- The SBS3D is fantastic fun too
	- I'm using 8bitdo with the moteandchuk emulation
	- plus it saves your game at the end of every boss battle and I beat one #again this was great fun and I could beat it in an hour or two I bet.  
	- #again #beat #short
	- 1/28/2021 I beat it!  I love that you can make progress in a pinball game and that its not that terribly hard.  It took me like 2-3 tries tonight to finish the last level.  
	- I love the graphics and the effect behind the ball on the thin layer of goo water covering the board.  This is a great game and I wish I had this as a kid.  I also wish more pinball games were like this.
	- Also when you beat it it says "Split Ball! Unlocked" which is awesome that its unlocking new features when you beat it!
	- I could still play it again someday and have fun with it.  it reminds me a lot of metroid prime pinball which I think came out 3-4yrs before this.
* RE4 Wii SBS3D 1/16/2021
	- I fired up some awesome cheats like slow enemies and also unlimited ammo.  I also fired up fast walk and changed the controls to go into firing mode with the chuk which makes more sense to my hands.  The slow mo is SUPER FUN and makes me feel like a god.  I also put on one hit kills.  
	- Funny bug where hes talking to someone ona  video chat device and you can see his shoulder sticking out of the side from behind the gui like it was a big cardboard cutout radio overlay haha
	- Well theres a bug where in 1-1 (which is taking me forever - this game never made sense to me) you push a bookshelf but in this version or setup it doesnt push anywhere :( when I removed all cheats and restarted it worked.  maybe it was the b or z to activate?  nope.  Maybe it was the run 2x as fast?  loosk like it.  
	- the videos are all a little choppy.  maybe because I compressed it in dolphin?
	- whats wierd is I dont think I knew how to really use the map in this game.  rn it is showing me exactly where to go at all times but I remember being almost completely lost.  
	- I just got past a sackhead chainsaw guy who I remember clearly killed me many times back in the day.
	- Something about not worrying about the controls and combat makes this game way better.  I still have to know them but I am used to them now.  Maybe its something about the map.  When I am able to explore at mostly my own pace I can get used to the map and figure things out but I cant brain when I'm constantly interrupted with life or death decisions and strategy requirements even if its apparently simple ones.  I cant make a big picture out of it all and keep in mind any of my goals, especially if I'm scared of being in terrupted and losing it.  In this case I know I can win all of the combat or run past them so I can solve the puzzles and explore the map basically at my pace.  The shooting here being so ammo starved isn't just pure FUN in and of itself. Also something about the friction caused by the laborious ammo starvation combat, it just feels like it sort of slows down the job of exploring and doing cool things in the world and unraveling the story and solving the puzzles
	- Back in the day I think my arms werent prepared to do this long term.  My muscles werent made for it, now that I've been doing tons of VR they are.  Also my wii wasnt set up right and was jittery and way too much pointer sliding.
	- Update: I was wrong about this.  I think it wasnt compatible and you can absolutely combine things on that inventory screen.  What were they thinking about inventory.  I bought a gun stock and I cant just install it I have to make room for it in my inventory as I buy it so that I can then immediately install it.  Maybe I'm expecting too much.  You should still be able to move things around though in inventory and i must be missing the button for it.  now I've got to cancel the transaction, get out of the purchase menu, get out of the seller gui, open my inventory, do the movements, then go re do it all.
	- lol funny side effect of my cheats: the enemies moving at 1/8 speed means entering the sellers store takes him a really long time (nto that long like 20s but thats 19s too long ).  its really great watching the animations of the bad boys in slow motion. its fun and interesting to see how they move and what they do.  and it feels like being in the matrix too!
	- without these cheats the damagage is not high enough.  it takes tons of shots to kill.  
	- the sniper rifle is way too sensitive and doesnt use the wii pointer so its not much fun.  
	- the lake monster boss battle was awesome because I have one shot kills on so it was super easy and I liked it that way
	- interesting the one hit kill didnt apply to the giant in the village square
	- OMG "I see the president has equipped his daughter with ballistics too" 
	- probably this game has some cool weapons later in the game and if you know where to look you can find enough ammo for it to be a funfest like a movie, but not so far.
	- The giant boss has a cool thing where if you can lure him to destroy the houses you can get a few more nice powerups from that
	- There was a cheap moment where you walk through a door and on the other side a guy has respawned and you cant avoid getting an axe wound
	- It crashed when I shot someone and I said ignore and it did but then crashed harder
	- When I can explore at mostly my own pace I love looking around and finding the hidden stuff and finding the treasures and figuring out how to get to them. 
	- The boss in the barn imho is cheap at full speed but really cool at 1/8 speed.  it would be an appropriate challenge on easy mode at like 1/2speed, but actually it takes like 40-50 handgun shots, and the rifle is way too cumbersome for it to be fun.  either you dont have fun by shooting with the rifle (which I presume kills in like 5-10) or blow  your ammo starvation load on that one boss :( tahts cheap.  taking half or 1/3 of the shots and moving a little slower would be fair for easy mode.  All of this as is is fine for hard mode - I basically have no complaints about hard mode.
	- playing with slow enemies makes me like this game much more.  It makes me once I beat it and know the whole game and have thegame in my head makes me want to consider trying it  again at more full difficulty
	- I've played in SBS3D some but mostly in pancake because 3D has been making me feel a little queasy maybe its the rotation blur/framerate? I gave it about 5min today inside a castle and felt funny so I stopped.  Update: According to the frame counter in dolphin it is 30fps
	- Getting into the castle opened a lot of options up because theres a bigger case and a semi auto in there.  I feel like a lot of the game is already past (I'm at 6-7h) but it seems like stuff like this should have been made available earlier.  Im also lucky that I've collected so many treasures so I could sell enough to buy the stuff I wanted.
	- I just realized that with the rifle as soon as you aim its about head level in front of you so you can take dudes out pretty quick with that trick sometimes
	- The flaming crossbowers can still hit you at full speed.  The models may not move fast but once they start their attack it s on autofire fast and they can take you and ashley down real easy if you step out from the wrong hallway
	- wow the TMP is super fun.  I found it in the game the merchant h ad me play and fell in love.  its automatic and wiimote aimed.  
	- I fuking hate sliding block puzzles they are -10 fun level
	- I liked ashleys section even if it had a stupid block puzzle.  The other puzzles were wonderful and interesting and fun and I love puzzles like that and then there was nice emotion afterwards!
	- I got to a part in the playthrough where the merchant was behind a little half wall like a cute shop and then behind was a door with a lower floor and I remember this being a problematic spot for me originally.  I then played as Ashley and only vaguely remember playing that part so I dont think I got much further than this scene and according to my save game i'm at like 12h18m although an hour or two of that was accidental game sitting around.  
	- At this point (ch4) the game has really hit its stride and is moving forward at a pretty fast pace.  the beginning was super slow relatively but now there are so many cool events in it i'm really starting to love it too (with the obvious caveat that I haven't been dealing with the unfair enemy difficulty or ammo starvation.  I basically only die when I miss a quicktime event or when theres a crossbower (virtually every time).  I think they shoot way faster in this 1/8 mode.   Also it seems to me that the save points and merchants are much closer together in these chapters which is better and more fun and better to make progress.  I dont feel the 'video game combat challenge' that they designed but its fun being a movie action hero and they designed an amazing world and story and I absolutely feel a part of the story and feel pleased to solve the puzzles and explore and find new things and treasures and secrets and figure out how to take out the ranged enemies without dying (which maintains consequences of your movements and action sequences).  Its really great this way and really great to be immersed so deep in such a great world and story without the angst of constant frustration or potential frustration.  Playing like this lets you get completely comfortable with the games controls, tropes, mechanics, and everything and just lets you avoid certain parts which if you choose you can come back and play later.
	- Pushing things is a problem.  It loosk like it just pushes things (shelves, statues etc) about 1/8 as much as it should.  you can usually just push many times to make the same progress, or remove some of the cheats (the 1/8 cheat I presume?)
	- its really funny that he falls into a pit and at the bottom near the spikes and impaled and dead crumpled bodies is the merchant just hanging out waiting for travellers to buy his wares lol.  Its a great place for the game but funny in other ways
	- Great moments
		- Some of the puzzles I liked: you are trying to get through a clocktower to another building but the front door is locked so you climb the stairs around the outside dodging catapult fire and taking them out with your rifle and taking out the bad boys on the stairs, then you get to the top and find a door which leads inside and you are around a complex gear mechanism that goes up and down many stories.  you can go up on this side and down on the other side on each level but some directions on some levels are blocked off so you go to the bottom to get back out and find that even the side door is blocked with a gate but it clues you in that theres probably a way to raise the gate so you go to the top and a note asya "if we block the gears in at least three places that should stop him from opening the gate" and you pull the lever and it doesnt budge so you have to find and shoot the wedges that they placed in the gears which could be on any level of the tower then pull the lever then go back down to exit the building
		- the xenomorph in the sewers near the elevator was incredibly tense even at slow speed.  it isnt all at slow speed and at one point the code decided to make it catch up and run at me really fast which was super spooky
		- Climb down to the bottom and theres a lever pull the lever and a trolley comes flying in with something you want but lands on an elevator which gets stuck half way down.  The circuit breaker gets popped and you have to go find it (huge switch somewhere else) then go back to retrieve the item.  
		- you have to find the two grails one for the king and one for the queen and put it in their hands
		- you have to find the three parts to a shield that has animals on it: the hawk crest, the lion crest and the ... and then put them in a wall for the wall to raise.  this one was a long term one where there were sub puzzles and story progression in the three wings of the castles to get to each of the animal crests.
		- you have to go through some houses and up stairs but if you want the secrets you have to figure out which windows to jump crash out of
		- you have to lure the big trolls over the pit of lava and then open the pit lid at just the right time (like in transformers the movie)
		- Theres a huge statue and a pool in front and to cross the pool theres a bridge but the bridge is sunken by a lever which is behind a door so you have to climb to level 1 and then cross the statues hands which are moving up and down and will take you to level 2 and 3 and you switch hands in the platform in between the hands
		- rotating mirror laser light puzzles
		- cool puzzle in a security system where you rotate arrows to let the laser through like that cat and mouse game for dreamcast.  
		- Some puzzles are self contained and others you have to know what to do like with a code or a reference from another area or something
		- I like the key card rewriter too
		- its cool that on the later levels with the regenerator enemies there are tables in rooms at dead ends to juke around and play do si do with them to give you more time
		- Timed pulling of levers.  its not hard but it adds nice interactivity like the card key rewriter does
		- The battle with krauser was really cool with all the perfectly timed quicktime events.  Did this part work in 1/8 mode?  later battle with him did not.
		- Timer on a lock.  Start the timer then survive until it opens and then escape through it
		- I like the idea of if you dont do well and lose lots of lives or health the only disadvantage is you have to go play more and grind to level up
	- difficulties
		- even in slow motion its crazy how many bullets some of the enemies take
		- there are a lot of times when my inventory is full (inventory space starvation is also a thing in this game) and I didnt want shotgun ammo but it was in the way of a lever or ladder so I had to take it but was full so I had to go into a menu inside the inventory menu and discard it and then confirm the action.  It was silly if you ask me.
		- Glitch where I had to reload on the battle in the stone village with krauser.  He jumped up and then went through the floor and even after 5 min I didnt see him again.  
		- The second krauser battle was great too.  I did it at full speed (since it wasnt working at 1/8) and it wasnt too bad.  the last part I figured it out on the 3rd try and then beat it on the 4th.  
	- tried SBS3D again and while its really cool it only took a minute before I felt funny.  I can handle it and could keep playing that way but its not exactly worth it.  I wonder if framerate is not fully mirrored into virtual desktop or if this game is just low frame rate.  the sickness definitely encourages walking vs running.  I played it during a literal minecart scene and probably would have been best to do it in another part because that was constant motion
	- The slow enemies make some people glitch like on repeat and I think the little guy boss after the statue I think its really glitched it seems to be attacking in a loop very fast with no pattern.  I'm going to try it withtout the 1/8speed.  yeah that fixed it good.  Also confirmed that the crossbow boys dont fire as fast when not in 1/8 speed so 1/8speed makes it difficult in a different way : never let them fire once.  And in terms of difficulty I just played out a battle at full speed and with unlimited ammo its super fun and not too hard (at least now after I'm real used to all of the controls).  
	- Adas note has a lipstick kiss on it.  nice touch
	- WHen you get across the water you can see the castle on the other side.  nice touch.
	- The regenerator enemies take a ridiculous amount of bullets and too much vague precision.  not fun.  10 sniper shots?  probably 100 smg rounds?  bologna  WEll ok you can probably run past htem somewhat, and theres even a jump to help you do that. and then 5 min later you get ascope to kill them with 2shots
	- You find a radio and the signal is jammed.  you have to go somewhere to unjam it.
	- This game brings back lots of fond memories: Metroid Prime, Alien Breed Descent Trilogy, RE2, MGS, RE Umbrella Chronicles,
	- you are about to escape but some bad boy right before he dies hits the button on the wall that security locks the door out
	- sexisst comments: after ada flies off into the night "hmmph women!" and later "I knew you'd be fine if you landed on your butt
	- OMG minor facepalm  I had forgotten what hte yello herb does!!!  I've just been stashing them or leaving them behind.  d'oh!  I also wondered about 5 times how to increase leons health lol
	- im at 5-2 and 17h32m and its a great game.
	- DONE!  I beat it on 1/27 at 11:21pm logging 20:27:41. I got a few crappy videos of the ending and my stats screen. What a bad ass movie of a game.  I could have beat it with unlimited ammo without too much trouble, but it would have been harder and less fun overall.  It makes you a bad ass.  Great game played this way.  A masterpiece. 
	- There are tons of bonus features.  You can go back and watch all fmvs, you can play a bonus game, separate ways, assignment ada, and the mercenaries.  Capcom absolutely delivered the goods with this game with amazing content.
	- I remember buying this at ToysRUs and I talked to the salesman who I made friends with and he said it was probably the best game he had ever played.  Now I see what hes talking about.
* MotoHeroz 1/28/2021
	- You know what?  I think I bought this back in the day!  It was fun for a while but it got WAY too hard and not fun anymore at least for a console level game when I could be playing other things in front of the tv.  Good game though. iirc its 4 players.
	- Now this didnt emulate.  it ran but with enormous unplayable constant graphical glitching no sense to the graphics at all.
* La-Mulana 1/28/2021
	- I'm slightly intrigued, certainly more than before i fired it up.  I really like the jumping and whipping controls.
	- Not sbs compatible.
* Wave Race Blue Storm Dolphin Gamecube 1/29/2021
	- This screams Excite Truck to me even if it plays quite different.  I suspect there was a related team.  It seems really good but certainly didnt draw me in in 2021 at all, however given the beautiful water effects and the fish and dolphins and sun and high res player textures (for the time) I bet this would have blown my mind in 2002 and especially if I had bought a gamecube and this game on launch day I would have loved it and would have played it all the way and it probably would have become beloved for me.
* Ikaruga Dolphin GC 1/29/2021
	- I remember buying this for Gamecube soon after it came out and I was so excited because Bangai-Oh had been one of my favorite games ever so I wanted more from that dev.  When I got it home I found a brutally hard bullet hell game with an interesting mechanic and it completely discouraged me.  I thought it looked amazing but had little fun with it and I think I returned it to gamestop in a day or something.
	- I beat the first level on practice mode with 1 continue.  Does it have unlimited continues?  I remember it being discouraging but maybe it sets you back if you continue?
	- Interesting.  I did pretty good!  Got to level 3 on 3 continues!  beat level 1 without losing a life.  all on easy mode ofc.
	- that should mean I unlocked practice mode on 2 and maybe 3.  
	- Its not as hard as I remember.  Probably when I played it back then I didnt know the mechanic and was thinking bangai-oh and its so totally different it discouraged me instantly with a tough as nails game with no progression.
	- I am proud of myself for getting that far even to level 3 of 5 on my first real try! 
	- Theres also multiple ways to practice: practice the whole level, practice just one section, watch a demo of it, play it slow thats pretty awesome imho.  this game is all about learning it and helping you learn to beat it in one sitting and thats pretty awesome imho.  
	- On level 3 my final continue was all due to me hitting the walls d'oh!
	- Also interesting I didnt beat the level 2 boss I ran out of time!
	- This will be awesome in 3D! (but possibly sickening - is it 60fps?  NOT LIKELY)
	- one thing funny is it didnt autosave unless you set it to do so.  You have to manually go save or set it to autosave.  weird but thats how things were for a while.
	- Later I am less impressed.  I tried it again and I can't get past level 3 yet.  But theres no way to practicelevel 3.  If they had been serious about practicing to win when you had unlocked getting there they would have let you practice it.  They are making it so you have to get to that level with enough lives to try it a few times and then you will die and have tgo play the whole game again. Progress isnt as enabl3ed as I thought.  Not bad but not great either and I am a bit sour about it.
* Monster 4x4 Stunt Racer Wii Dolphin
	- It looks like it is emulating properly behind an enormous fundamental graphics incompatibility because every bit of the graphics is split and broken even the splash screens. thats whether I run it as an nkit.gcz or iso
* Mad World Wii Dolphin 1/29/2021
	- This looks amazing already.  I bet it looked great on wii but with this upscaling it looks fantastic.  the textures are almost perfect.  Most of the things that make wii games look old arent here so it looks so great. 
	- Cool futuristic apocalyptic gritty attitude. super bloody and gory.  Story is like running man or smash tv.  
	- Wow this might be the best 3d beat em up I've ever played!  I feel like it would be better to teach thes things as the game goes on instead of in one big set at the beginning.  Still the tutorial is pretty good.  The music is pretty cool for the setting, the voiceovers are good and mature although get repetitive.
	- its cool that you get extra points for making it more violent.
	- I beat a bull mini boss and a huge eddie guy who said "Ill murderize ya" and it was fun combat!  i lost a few lives but havent had to continue yet and I've picked up a few red balloon extra lives. and now I'm back to the map!  i beat the whole first level!
	- Again its only 6h long so this could be a lot of fun beating things up like this.
	- Looking at it a few hours later it was really cool and I'm glad I played that level but I dont feel compelled to play anymore.  I am not particularly curious what more they have in store.  I know it will be gory and bloody, but I have already been able to use all of the moves.  So I guess I actually wish it was shorter and I might play through more.  Not complaining but also probably not playing again.
	- At first I thought it would be hashtag again but not anymore
* Odama GC Dolphin 1/29/2021
	- Microphone into slot 2?  I seem to remember it came with a mic maybe.  Oh wow you can set that in gamecube options.  Well at least the warning went away.  I dont know how to triger it becasue the intput setting didnt register any buttons. Wait xinput shoulder l worked.  lets see if that works in game
	- Whoa in the lore it defines Nintendo!  
	- I remember playing this back in the day once and I thought I would love it but didnt end up loving it afterall.  Actually I remember it beign clumsy and frustrating.
	- Well this is so clumsy.  The microphone doesnt work yet, the graphics are kind of terrible.  the idea is interesting but the pinball is slow and clunky and theres nothing discrete or controllable about it.  Its not fun for me.  
* Soul Calibur Legends 1/29/2021
	- WOW This combat is fukin fun!  Maybe its the motion plus but this is responsive slashing side and up and down.  My wiimotes back in the day just didnt respond like this.  they always felt clumsy and slow.  What if it was tv lag?  what if not only did my wiimotes led sensor bar not point quite right and I was too far so the aiming was bad but what if there was kind of enormous lag somewhere in the system probably in the tv itself?  That might have made most of these games less fun!  then again other systems didnt have problems and even mario galaxy didnt have any problems ... hmm.  still this is fantastic. #history
	- I set it to easy mode
	- This is like an epic movie and I love stuff like this.  I owned this 10yrs ago.  I wish I had given myself permission to play this and enjoy it.
	- the controls and combat are really nothing like soul calibur so if you are looking for more soul calibur forget this.  If you want a movie like simple motion controlled combat game based on the same universe lore and backstory this is your game!
	- I love this.  I'm smiling like a kid.  Why do I let myself enjoy this now and not then?  expectations?  Other demands on my time?  Restlessness?  I thought I should be doing something else all the time.  Right now I can play this if I want to.  
	- I think in this game easy mode actually IS easy!
	- #Again
	- 1/31/2021
	- playing later its fun but the controls are somewhat sloppy.  I dont understand the dodge like at all.  And it says to shake the chuk and swing wiimote at same time for some special move but its sloppy.  I'm getting more used to it and liking it anyway honestly.
	- The jumping over darts in the hallway is bullshit.  Especially when you have to jump over spikes and darts.  The jump just isnt precise enough for this kind of expectation.  its forgiving on life at least on this level so its not a big deal at all just sloppy
	- More than having a problem with the sloppiness on these levels (which is not holding me back and is still super fun) it just concerns me a bit that on later levels it is going to expect more from these sloppy controls and is goign to get stupid
	- I hit plus and it fast forwarded through the dialogue haha I missed some stuff that way on accident
	- Thinking back I can see why people would have complained and why I might not have been happy about this.  Its imprecise.  If you want a fun combat game with motion controls for immersion and fun and wehre anyone can pick up and play then this works great!  If you want a fighting game with deep fighting mechanics and precise responses this is just not that game and I can see why expecting that if you had bought this it would have been jarring, frustrating, disappointing and even kind of outrageous.  It is a spin off rather than a soul calibur game but it looks similar enough.  If they had done it with regular controls it would have been a bit different. as it is I love the controls and I knew exactly what I was getting into so this is great fun. 
	- If this had actually normal soul calibur controls I would have perhaps loved this game even more ... maybe not though.  "Fight through all of these enemies without dying and you get the next part of this deep story."  this way it wanted to mix the combat controls with adventure movement controls.  
	- I like that there is weapon upgrades, tag team player selection (so you have two lives) and also multiple characters.  I like that the story is so deep.
	- Part of the thing that makes movement seem so artificial here is its only 8 directions
	- oh its got some puzzles like flames putting out and rotating statues!
	- Movement
		- boob jiggle physics are interesting.  If you just tap the stick down ivy will turn towards you and jiggle her boobs
		- Chuk left swing left is one cool special move.  Chuk left swing right is a different special move  I'm starting to get the hang of the moves.  I can totally see why people would think they were not discrete (like I did) and they are certainly not as discrete as button presses, but I'm starting to think they aren't bad after all.  This combat seems more discrete than skyward sword imho
		- Chuk swing while dodging does a guard impact and I was playing against astaroth who was cheap.  I did a guard impact at just the right time and he was blocked but the IMMEDIATELY attacked again before I could attack as ivy.  Cheap.
	- Another thing about motion controls is they are taxing in relativity.  As much as you want to think that swinging your arms about for a few minutes isnt taxing ... well ... maybe its not for a professional wrestler like Dolph Ziggler but for me and I believe for most people it is enough motion that after a while it can be felt.  Its not enough that you cant do it, but its a certain level of fatigue that just doesnt exist when moving yoru hands tiny emounts to press buttons which can be done for much longer without fatigue.  its the same when a gamepad player is learning to use a mouse keybaord and vice versa but both of those require an order of mag less motion and therefore fatigure than this does. It also means you have to have a bit of space and be arranged such that you can swing your arms therefore your posture can't be quite as slouchy as it can playing witha  gamepad and I dont mean that derisively because there is value in relaxing with a game and a gamepad and totally resting most of yoru body and thats great this is just different
	- I'm not sure what the strat is for that dragon boss fafnir.  It seemed like it was just flail about and I think if I had done that I would have had an easier time and thats what I did at the end, but I was trying to figure out how to hit him without getting hit myself and ... well ... I dont have any idea.
	- I like that in this vienna stage there are lots of ways you can go from any area but there are just forcefields blocking you off except from where you can go at any time.  Need to beat more enemies, no exit.  all enemies beat?  oen of the exits opens and it says "Go help at the east gate" but theres only one way to go.  I like that.  it doesnt try to explain the forcefields and I think thats smart.  in the indoor levels its exactly the same but with doors.  it would be a great situation to use for secrets somehow.
	- Its cute how in the game they have to travel to asia and africa and its casual trips "we need to go to egypt" "take us to the mountain where they took you before in asia" lol
	- 2/6/2021 ok its fun and all and it is, and it does make me wave my arms around in ways they are not accustomed to so a few of my lesser used muscles are getting worked and thats a good thing, but tbh its a little boring. Thats not just a bad thing because its fun to play this while I'md oing something else kind of like that transformers game and I love it for that.  it IS fun and I'm unlockiing characters and weapons (sor to fbut dont understand the weapon upgrades at all) but if it got frustrating there woudlnt be a whole lot to make me want to proceed.  I'm at 2h15m according to the save file and apparently its an 8hr game?  Well I've got a lot left then.  As long as it doesnt decide to add some stupid new mechanic that pisses me off endlessly I shoudl be able to enjoy it at this level through to the end and come away with fond memories of it.  I do LOVE how I can progress through the story and that part is fantastic.  THe levels are super derivative although the puzzles are changing (if not legit challenging).
	- 3DSBS I tried it a little while ago and its at 50fps which is weird and I was only in there for a few minutes but the 3d was great indoors actually and I hope to do more later (I might have an ear infection or something because in the last few weeks I'm all of a sudden way more motion sick than ever before)
	- This mummy tomb boss is pretty cheap with the fire collision going further than the visuals.  Its not clear on any of these bosses exactly what to do to beat them so you just flail and it works haha.  Its possible I would hate this game on hard mode.
	- I'm not totally sure about this but I think the graphics on this are worse than Soul Calibur for DC even though that game came out 8yrs before it?  I could be wrong maybe if I saw that upscaled I wouldnt think so.  I looked at a video of the x360 upscaled original soul calibur and I think its about the same which isnt really a great sign for this game.
	- Lloyd is a cheap boss.  Not fun. Lots of stabbing forward seems to be the secret. it  more like a soul calibur battle but you cant use any of the moves you think might work they arent responsive
	- Ive been playing with no audio and not listening to the game audio and it works. 
	- I'mon a cannnon level where I have to beat boys while getting shot at by cannons. The controls are just not good enough to make this fun.  You can target the cannon but can't walk through or around the badboys fast enough to get to them witout getting attacked and when you get attacked then they get targeted so then you have to retarget the cannons and try to escape.  also there are tons of wolves and enemies AND cannons from every angle.  annoying.
	- I beat the huge pirate on my first try but only with a sliver of life left on one player.  It was frustrating at first but once you figure out the patterns its not too bad.
	- The battle vs mitsurugi and astaroth was only won because i became a big stabby boy stab stab stab stab stab. 
	- There should be a special move when you tag your other character.
	- I dont think i would have liked this back in the day because I didnt have the patience to learn this new control scheme.  Not just learn the controls but get my forearm and shoulder enough used to spending a lot of time with it.
	- moves: holding left or right and swinging back and forth is powerful.  Stabbing is powerful and stabbing and then swinging up is powerful and then slashing down many times is powerful.  I've learned to block a big and hardly at all learned to dodge
	- Beyond the White Darkness: This level is getting shitty.  Two dragons to beat.  I cant even beat the first one with 1.5 players.  I've lost twice and its really long.  Thats not fun.  The third time I circled a lot and used the c button to power up and beat the first dragon without much trouble.  That was comforting that I could get better that quickly
	- Return of Guardian Fafnir: Well its getting annoying because this level also had a mid boss that kicked my ass.  Playing boss levels several times makes sense.  This isnt a boss level or if it is I ahvent even gotten nera the boss.  In this case it was 3 big knights and they were a different color and they attacked faster and killed me in like 15s.  Also the previous catapult hallways stun lock you super cheap.  This second time through I barely lived through the catapult hallway and barely lived through the 3 knights after powering up with c.  Also not enough life powerups just little ones never refilled. goddammit.  I had the final dragon down to a SLIVER but he killed me and now I have to waste 10 more minutes.  This is not the kind of game where replaying levels full of frustrating situations is 'fun'.  Ok on the 3rd try the catapults are good if you run at them and spin horizontal 1 2 3.  The skellys before that are good with a charge and then overhead 1 2 3.  The knights with powerup and lots of spinny attacks arent too terribly bad.  Ok on this 3rd try I beat the final boss and it wasn't as bad.  It took about 10min and I didnt really want to spend 30min on this one level :(
	- Now on the next level these dragons are still super cheap and hard and not fun.  At leats this one didnt have two of them.  Its fun swinging around your wiimote and bashing things.  Its not fun being expected to execute precise moves and fighting more with the controls than the bad boys.  The games difficulty curve went way up like 3 levels ago and its a very different amount of fun.  In the last few levels the first room of enemies takes you out most of the way down your life, theres way less full life refills, and lots of ninjas and other cheap enemies.  I've also noticed that block basically does nothing.  Its 1am and I'm kind of pissed so I'm going to bed and hopefully it wont feel so hard tomorrow morning.
	- I dont really understand the weapon upgrades, can you grind to upgrade your weapons?  I dont think you can so whats the point? 
	- Imperial Army Headquarters: holy crap there is a shitty maze here.  on my first try it destroyed me and I didnt stand a chance. Ok on my second try it looks like its a maze.  Its not easy but if you go the wrong way you get destroyed if you go the right way you might be able to make it through.  thats my theory lets see if it works out. Yeah it wasnt too bad after that.
	- I'm a quartz warlord now after like 8h40m (fun I guessed that and yeah it was 8:40:01 haha
	- This Siegfried-siegfried level is bs. It doesnt refill you before each battle.  on the 3rd battle I almost made it.  COnstant stun lock is not fun.  I did it on the 2nd or 3rd try but it was not fun.
	- There was a fun circular castle room puzzle where you had to learn to go backwards.  I thought that was clever and awesome and innovative.
	- Nightmare is super cheap and there is a 10 minute puzzle process prior.  So I'll have to do that several times ... stupid.  ok 2nd time was worse than first.    3rd time was better.  One super frustrating thing is there are a bunch of pots but you cant get to them.  How do you freewalk?  i want to disconnect from targeting this guy and walk around because I can't hit the pots without pointing at them and they are in a corner. The 4th time I flailed a lot more with both chuk and mote and won without too much trouble.  Got lucky too becasue I accidentally hit one of the pots and was able to back into the healing powerup but legit didnt need it.  took 12:46 that time so probably 45 min total for this one level :(
	- I wonder if I had played with siegfried the whole time if his weapon would have been more than lvl 3 or whatever and if these battles would have been easier?   its also funny to wonder why you would pick one of the waeapons that wasnt the highets level you have?
	- There are some co op and party mode levels in this game somewhwere that I just unlocked some of.  
	- Chapter 6 ... is this level last?
	- AHHH If you hold down A you drop your target and get to run freely
	- I feel like I suck at video games.  I'm at 10:25:53 and not done yet but most peoples average is 8h.  :(  This game in these later levels keeps setting you back. 
	- I just beat the first part of ch 6 but just BARELY.
	- Lost Attack on the imperical city east gate :( so depressing.  Not fun to lose and have to play 10 min again :( I suck :( .   Failed a second time on the last gate.  have to play 10 min again :( fuck you game.  Ok finally got it wth more flailing and less strategy.  it felt like 10min but it took 5:36 to beat it the last time.  
	- Final battle; I beat the first boss without dying the second form I got half way down but its pretty cheap.  I'm real frustrated rn but I hope I can keep going until I win.  second form loss, loss, loss, loss, learned that I can deflect the circles last time this time learned i can deflect them only if I swing perpendicular. Got in a few more spmacks and WIN! Credits!
	- #win beat soul calibur legends 2/9/2021 save file says 11h15m19s
	- UGh I dont know what to say about this.  Glad I beat it ... I guess??? Should have spent my time on something better I guess???  Liked the easy parts kind of a lot as a casual game, thought the hard parts were really stupid and cheap.  I am relieved that I finally beat it though honestly.  There was something in me back then that thought that I woudl like it and should play it and I'm glad I did. it feels good and helps me feel complete like checking off something I've watned to do for a long time.  thats a nice feeling of satisfaction.  Its kind of sad seeing it go.  Super mixed feelings here.  
	- Swinging perpendicular could have been a cool major battle mechanic for boss battles. 
* Namco Museum Remix wii 1/30/2021
	- FIXED THe carnival arcade games dont display properly like super pac man is super distorted.  it actually plays just fine but the graphics in the arcade emulation inside the game are distorted.  The outer edge of the screen has a pretty picture that is clear.  sound is great.  turning off scaled EFB copy didnt help. oh!  Turning off 'force texture filtering' Fixed the glitch and distortion!!! you can do it while you are in the emulated game no problem.
	- In the carnival arcade emulations its weird because to select things you usually use a but to quit the game in game you have to go to the menu and use z
* Frogger Hyper Arcade Wii 1/30/2021
	- Holy crap a unity splash screen on the Wii???
* Transformers Cybertron Adventures Wii 1/30/2021
	- Wow this is amazing I love it so much instantly.  I cant imagine a more fun game in some ways.  light guns. racing.  Easy mode thats actually easy.  This is wonderful!  i just beat the first level and hardly took any damage (probably because it was in easy mode)
	- This along with Soul Calibur Legends and probably DQ Mirror are three gems that I should have played when I had a wii that if I had given them the tech attention and my own permission I would have loved them dearly.  But I can love them now!!!
	- Theres actually an autobot campaign and a decepticon campaign
	- The first level I did great but was just getting used to the controls which were a bit foreign to my hands so it might take me a bit to figure them out.
	- #Again  
	- I just played chapter 2 and its so exciting like being in a movie.  
	- The sniper rifle in this wii shooter works better than any others.  I'm not sure why others dont work this way: aim where you want to zoom.  hit zoom.  The zoom goes right where you were aiming.  Adjust from there and fire (or just hold down fire and it fires for you).
	- 60fps throughout. 
	- Its a really nice low poly but high-large-detail environment
	- Also this is the only light gun shooter with cover like time crisis!  I love that about it.  Best game on Wii?
	- A few complaints: Unskippable cutscenes?  at least they are good with optimus voice actor.  Checkpoints are unclear. 
	- Its not too hard in certain parts to run off the road and have to restart a battle section or two before that.  Final boss battle I got the boss half way down then accidentally ran off the confusing road and had to start it all over.  not a big deal since its the final boss.
	- I used missiles on the final boss and it worked!  i beat the autobot campaign at 11:35 probably took me 4h and it was awesome all the way through.  I had to try the final boss 3-4 times only once because I took too much fire on accident.  Thi sis all on easy mode ofc.
	- Most effective seems to be: sniper rifle: cover, aim at enemy, hold zoom, release cover, fire. theres a timing there that gives you headshots.
	- SBS3D INteresting: 60fps is nice but 60s and I'm feeling funny in my tummy - im pretty susceptible to motion sickness these days for some reason - But there is a weird artifact: all of the glow from the lights and the road and things is on two planes and one of those planes is basically on the hud so the 3d is definitely not without artifacts or flaws.  Its not a playability issue and I played a driving part with megatron and it was really cool.  It all looked great.  it didnt perform well at 8x upscaling but it did at 4x
	- PLUS for each of the levels you beat there are 4 challenges to try to accomplish in that level later.  This is a fantastic game.
	- I'm having lots of fun playing this while watching tv.  Its a really good and interesting game for that.  and rn I'm playing on easy but playing on normal or hard I might have to try harder and make it even more interesting!  I feel like compared to any resident evil or dead space or even that sin and punishment this is more casually fun light gun gaming than any of the rest.  I love it.
	- Beat 2/5/2021 #win Interesting: When you beat the campaign on autobot and decepticon it resets to 0 and then gives you a 1 and I dont knwo what that means :) lets see if it seems different. I couldnt tell a difference in the first autobot mission.
	- Its cool because starting it over even though it was just a few days ago the story isnt so memorable that I remember it and thats good because now on the second play through i'm catching way more about the story and putting it all in context.  
* Midway Arcade Treasures 1 2 3 GC 1/30/2021
	- Wow the robotron on here is arcade perfect.  its wonderful and the controls are excellent mapped to my 8bitdo
	- Wow it even saves your high scores!!!  Lovely!
	- Championship Sprint is really fun on the first track anyway and the graphics are awesome!  the controls work pretty well but maybe too sensitive but you can go really fast and I bet some people could get really good at it
	- MK2 made me rage quit it must be set on super hard or i'm tired because I couldnt beat first fight
	- Treasures 3 didnt run. frame rate was 5
	- Total Carnage in 2 is really cool!  I used prbably 30 continues to get to and beat the first boss but its pretty fun and super brutal and bloody.  its cool how they use sprites so abundantly and for explosions and everything.  This had to be fun to make if  you ask me.  When you shoot the boss sometimes it blasts flames otu the other side like its really hurting him which I think is cool.  Of course its super cheap and would be zero fun with limited lives.
* Frogger Hyper Arcade Edition Wii 1/30/2021
	- THis is a great frogger based party game for 1-4 players (with ai players) where you like try to step on as many squares last before goign through the end portal.  Its really fun!
* House of the Dead Overkill Wii 1/31/2021	
	- The B movie aesthetic is through the roof fantastic.  
	- The shooting is a little bit too fast paced. If it were just 10% slower I would have more fun.  I could line up my shots better and hit some more headshots and it would be more fun that way.  Cheats?  I like it when I get the slow down powerup.  thats great.
	- the pause menu has a heartbeat.  thats bullshit.
	- THe jerky movement causing misses and especially missed headshots may have seemed interesting to the devs and certainly makes it 'harder' but its randomness removes any discrete nature of whether I can aim for their head and hit it and that is fundamentally not FUN for me. 
	- I cant help but compare to resident evil and I prefer that.
	- The arcade nature of this is great and it could be fun with a friend to play through with all the great b-movie qualities.  There are collectables and civilians to save from zombies which I think is really cool and adds nice replay.
	- Something bizarre is going on in this game too.  All of my getting hit with no exceptions were due to unnecessary and involuntary reloading.  The bullets are listed off to the left so I know there were more.  Fire twice.  Involuntary reload.  get hit.  reload again.  get hit again.  fire twice. reload again.  wtf.  Am I accidentally triggering this???
	- This brain boss is -5 fun.  super slow long un fun battle without any clear indication of him getting hit.  constantly getting hit due to reload.  hes vulnerable for a moment?  reload.  when I can fire again hes invunl again.  bullshit
	- I beat the first boss and said out loud "that was terrible.  What a terrible game".  Its probably not terrible for everyone but jesus for me ugh.
	- Well at least it has upgradeable and collectable weapons so you can upgrade to less recoil (which I didnt mention is bullshit too) and can upgrade to less reload (accidentally did recoil before reload d'oh)
	- I remember buying house of the dead 2 on Dreamcast and the gun and being so excited ... and then so let down.  kind of for the same reasons.  Really its the reasons of jerky swaying randomized movement that can't be controlled for skill its just for me constantly and deeply frustrating hindering all enjoyment of the shooting.  I remember loving the heads and limbs exploding and thinking that was really cool, but also that it had none of the depth or excitement of time crisis or any of the feeling of mastery.  A playstation game being way better than the best dreamcast gun game?  say it isnt so!  its so. :( 
	- I hate this game.
* Dragon Quest Swords: The Masked Queen and the Tower of Mirrors 2/10/2021
	- Nostalgia
		- The intro with the theme and the save music really took me back. I love that about these games.
		- its cute that they used the same NES sound for stair climbing!
		- and when he says eeh frizz it makes an NES sound!
	- Controls
		- I'm in the tutorial and I dont like it.  Even in the tutorial its making clear that you have to be precise and thats bullshit.  I applaud what all these games were trying with motion controls and this looks more precise than most and feels good to slash because its so quick but I dont have a good feeling.  The part I liked least was stabbing because apparently you have to point and move it real straight :(
		- I like the blocking
		- I really Like the master stroke. it was like I was he man!
		- Are you kidding?  Nunchuk isnt used?  You have to use the dpad?  wtf???
		- this is less clumsy than soul calibur legends.
		- ok on my first battle it was really fun slashing those slimes!
		- I liked the combat in the slime battle its fun!
		- in my 3rd battle there were two moles and I couldn't block both of their dirt attacks at the same time :(  I dont like it when you cant avoid getting hit.
		- something annoying: You slash and swing and then have to re-aim to put your attack focus somewhere else
	- 30fps
	- 9h
	- The intro scene is good with good voice acting perfect for the game.  Its taking a long time to get this game started though but maybe thats how it should be?  I went to save and the save file said it had been on for 32min.  I'm making notes and stuff but thats kind of a long time and I havent even left the city.  To be fair though I like it so far.
	- I really like how when you are on the path and you push forward it just naturally follows the path.  Its intuitive but it also just feels super polished.
	- 
	- Oddities
		- Its all kind of ... slow?  the turning is super slow.  The checking inside barrels is slow and reminds me of professor layton (which is a slow game on purpose).  The dialogue is slow.
		- I can barely believe that to save you have to go to the church in town.  geez thats so 1980s.  
		- WHOA Big User Interface No No:  When you go to church to save (which is archaic) This is fine: Select confession, Select yes to save, Select yes to continue.  BUT if you are not careful and pull the trigger instead of hit the a button, you will say NO to save and NO to continue and lose all of your progress!  that would have pissed me off so bad.  :(
	- Tips:
		If you return to town voluntarily you keep all of your money, if you die you lose half.
	- I died without even completing one quest and now I feel stupid and am angry at the game.   How could anyone beat this in 8h when you spend 15-20 min or more on a quest and die and have to go start it all over from the beginning?  
	- this game is bullshit in important ways.  it introduced like 5 enemies in the first tiny amount of quest.  Its probably fine if you want to learn the new control scheme for your combat and if you have lots of time to invest and want to get deep into the game. 
* MLB Power Pros 2008 2/10/2021
	- I bought the previous version on wii back in the day and thought it was really cool but didnt spend much time with it.  PacBilly loves this game.
	- I'm playing as the 2008 cubs so that might not be a great team oh well
	- There are tons of gameplay options which are cool to make it simpler and control options to make it simpler.  I'm playing an exhibition but if you can set those options for the campaign I might actually like that.
	- it gives me roster options but I have no fucking idea what to do with those.
	- for pitching you have to adjust slightly but the wii nunchuk (at least the one I have) reallyd oesnt allow for slight analog adjustments.
	- I dont know how to field.
	- I'm already losing in the top of the 1st. :( 
	- Now I'm plkaying yankees.  The stadium looks great.  
	- I've got the computer pitching for me too!  Now tahts fucking fun!  I dont care about pitching I just want to hit!  and they field for me too!  I set my fielding and pitching to powerful!  
	- well now I dont even know how to swing the bat :( 
	- Ok I changed some options and now I can swing and the batting is pretty fun!  
	- Next Steps: See if i can get the computer to pitch and field for me for a whole season?  That would be legit fun!
	- Well in this exhibition I'm not hitting very well but its fun learning without them destroying me.  I'm not messing up fielding since its the computer doing it.  I have only made a few hits, mostly I miss.  BUT I like the mechanics of the batting.  Its fun just doing it.  AND its fun like watching a baseball game that I care about when I'm not batting.  I love this part.  
	- Even though I played espn in 1996 and championship baseball well ... I just dont have the skills to think it all through and learn to do all of the pitching and fielding and I never had the skills to make the tough calls on where to throw the ball when fielding which is obviously key. 
	- 7th inning and I'm not even reasonable at hitting yet  I got to third base once.
	- 60fps
	- i have NO IDEA how anyone would have played this with the nunchuk ... these must not be original nintendo nunchuks
	- dammit they scored on me :( I will probably lose now :(  NOPE!!! I did it !  I got 4 runs that next inning! yay me!!!!  THEN 4 runs the next inning!!!
	- I feel like i'm at a great baseball game! 
	- oh wow theres 'pro points'! its like an RPG kind of i wonder what I can spend these on?
	- Ok in the season mode you can change most of the options I was talking about but you can't make your auto pitcher professional only novice.  I dont want any drafting or anything
	- Oh!  This season mode is all management?  I may have set something wrong but it almost looks like I'm not playing ... maybe I have to wait my turn for my teams game? yeah thats what it was.   Thats kind of cool that it simulates every day and all of the games.  It makes it way more real.
	- Yeah this season mode is great!  I won my first game of the season 23-4 and now on my second game I'm batting great
	- Its cool that its got a practice mode to train your players and also that theres an automatic so it takes care of most of that for me.  Theres a whole thing about abilities and lucking into pushing a hitter to make a great hit but it has to be learned by practicing in pairs with a team member you actually trust?  I dont understand how to do it in game but its really cool.
	- Ok so I've played 4 or 5 games and am totally clobbering the other team every time which is super fun!  BUT I'm realizing that playing 162 games of this at this speed ... well ... no thanks! 20-30min per game ... uhh ... 50-75hrs?  no thanks! 
	- Maybe theres a way to make fast paced games?  that would be super fun!  It doesnt seem that there is.  not for the season at least.
	- there is a wii remote section and I think this game got some flak for not having swing motion controls in the main season, but thats why a lot of people liked it.  It just depends.  I remember some level of disappointment over that.  I wonder if that fooled me when I bought it.  I have a memory something like "of course since this is a wii game it will be just like playing wii sports baseball but with a whole huge season I can play like that!  It will be great!  i will be so good at wii sports baseball when I'm done playing a season of this game!"
	- its a deep game.  All of the teams and players and stadiums are here.  Plus tehres an MLB life mode which I dont know what that is and theers a Success mode too.
	- This is a great game to play with the filters: 32bit is awesome.  Acid trip is fun and interesting to watch the lines move around so smoothly
	- WOW I was playing with the buttons and hit the right trigger and it said 'big swing' and now I can hit fly balls and stuff.  All of my 6 games with 20+ leads were with just line drives and stuff.  like 3 pop fly balls total.
	- OH You can advance the schedule and it will autoplay some of the games!  thats pretty cool!  
* Mushroom Men: The Spore Wars
	- idk this is beautiful!
	- whoa you build new weapons?  Crafting?
	- ugh the catching of flies is bullshit. you havet to be perfectly aligned with them and at the right angle and position.  thats stupid
	- 30fps
	- its got a gentle slow tutorial which is nice
	- now I beat chapter 1. didnt take long.
	- controls are good. I'm using emulated wiimote but real wiimote worked fine too.  They arent perfect but they are workable for wiimote controls.  The hitboxes for enemies attacks are too big its easy for them to do it. The floating is too floaty and hard to control.  The whole control scheme is completely new and would have been hard to get used to back then.
	- its cool because there are collectables and crafting!
	- its cool that you can point and move items with the wiimote. 
	- Now I like that if you die your checkpoint doesnt respawn the enemies you killed
	- its not bad at all.  not a masterpiece.  pretty boring imho.  It would be cool in vr or 3d though.  
	- Reminder that the soundtrack is Les Claypool!

* Dead Effect 2 3/3/2021
	- I like it so far.  the text is funny on my hand when I first get in game.  I can barely read it against the background except the background of my hand.  
	- It thinks I'm using vive controllers ... is that my fault?  No pseudovive is off. So I have to use the toouchpads?  well ok ... thats not as good but ... maybe I can reconfigure in steamvr?  
	- I like that its got simple follow markers.  
	- It seems like the floor is moving up and down which is super disconcerting and I wanted to keep going but its best to end early than get really sick.  
	- 3/13/2021 I didnt get as sick but I did teleport.  I liked very much the shooting.  it was really precise and felt like a light gun game.  It wasnt stupid like house of the dead.  Theres a lot of story and it walks you through everything which I like.  There were lots of scary parts too.  Also its cool that you have upgrades and bonuses after the level and some experience points stuff going on.  I really like this.  
	- The controls were a little clumsy.  I selected someone elses steamvr mapping and that helped, but I had a hard time holstering my weapon and stuff.  could just be wmr.  Also maybe because it doesnt know my room so well atm but it kept moving a bit.  I noticed that sometimes using the joystick it would bounce and you would turn and it would bounce and instantly turn back.  not cool bro.  


* Battlezone VR 5/19/2021
	- Wow this is amazing!
	- I LOVE The level and world structure of this.  Apparently randomly generated worlds at least campaigns and you get to pick the length of the campaign and the difficulty!  I beat the first level in my campaign with seed 'ZZZ' (yes you get to pick the seed!) many Zs made it easy and short.  This might be the single best way of doing randomly generated worlds ever.  Are the level interiors also entirely randomly generated?  I would imagine no which is fine by me.  OH ZZ is extreme difficulty. ZZZ is beginner difficulty. I apparently beat a level in ZZ mode wow!
	- I didnt like that I ran out of ammo on level 1.  If this is going to be an ammo starvation game then I am out
	- I liked the combat.  You always have to lead your target.  There is no hitscan or raycast shots and I like that (at least there arent any from you afaik) It wasnt too hard to beat the first level.  The controls were great.  The sense of scale was awesome.  The graphics were Tron-like.
	- Controls and visuals would probably create motion sickness for sensitive people.  It worked great with mouse+kb but smooth locomotion moved pretty fast and you strafed and stuff so for some.
	

* Scanner Sombre 5/20/2021
	- I'm just a few minutes in an its amazing!  reminds me of The Swan game ... unfinished swan?  just in one visual way only but thats really unique
	- and this is in VR so its super spooky
	- I've never felt so much like I was exploring a cave!  one that no one has ever been in.
	- I loved the puzzles too!
* Krypt Krawler 6/28/2021
	- Bought on the summer sale for like $1 and it says its compatible with valve index and oculus rift, but in every other case the games work with SteamVR and therefore wmr and vive too, but eveyrone is reporting it specifically doesnt work with vive.  
	- It wont even launch in steam vr mode to let me try it out.  Disappointing.  Should i return it?  well it makes me mad how they handled this, but I could go over to cristis computer and play it so maybe I'll keep it idk.  
* Crystal Rift 6/28/2021
	- Aww this stinks. This game doesnt work either :( 
	- This one at least you can look around and that part looks really cool but controls dont work at all.  idk if they are gamepad or what.  maybe I'll try that but it certainly isnt using touch controls at all.  and keyboard didnt work either. 
	- well yeah the controls are gamepad and the main menu works with the SF30pro which is nice but then 
	- when you start a new game  ... everything goes black and thats it.
		- in a discussion if you dont start steam vr in advance then it says it will work.  no that didnt work because now I can't even use my gamepad :( 
		- but it also says you will be given two options dont choose the steam vr option choose the other one.  the first time I got two options this last time I only got one option
		- gd it the oculus option showed up but doesnt show in the headset, the steam vr option doesnt let me use my gamepad all of a sudden.  bull shit.
		1. 	Launching from desktop doesnt launch in VR
		2. Launching with steam running but steam vr not running gamepad doesnt work
			4. using xbox wired controller works in this mode but the screen still goes black.
		3. Launching with steam and SteamVR running  and gamepad works but the screen goes black when you start a new game
		4. using big picture mode lets you launch without steam vr running and after that doesnt work.
		5. Launching in oculus mode without steam running just runs the game in windowed mode
	- The game doesnt let you multiask either because even when its not focused it doesnt let the mouse outside of its window size :(
	- the play space is centered behind me and not adjustable afaik which is annoying.  update: if you go into options and set it to seated mode then it seems to reset the position
* Pistol Whip 7/8/2021
	- Wow this is a wonderful game.  Its rhythm but also a cool on rails shooter.  I want more on rails shooters regardless of rhythm
	- We got it for quest 2 and the shooting feels tighter and more responsive somehow. Maybe its haptics, or the feel of the trigger button or the speed of the controller communication idk.
	- This is one of the best games on VR.  Its also a great workout, the music is great too.
* Raygun commando VR 7/11/2021 Free
	- Ok I had fun with this and can recommend it and would not have been mad paying $5 for it but to be clear it is short, and it is clumsy but it is also fun. Its robots in a space station and sometimes you don't know where they are coming from or shooting you from or anything. I found myself shouting "No BAD ROBOT" out loud while I was playing the whole time and I really did have a good time playing it. It often wasnt clear when I killed the bosses or why the levels were advancing which was a big part of the clumsy thing I was talking about so I would give it a 3/10 on polish but an 8/10 on fun. I would play more if there was more to play and would enjoy it.
	- Beat it only having died one time and that was early on before I knew that the enemies could be anywhere.  
* Waves of Death VR Demo 
	- This didnt work at all.  It was funny that the warning screen (which is extensive and also has many words that i cant read to the right and left) that warned about epilepsy and not playing whiel you are tired, was so glitchy and flickering and flashing and scraping that it hurt my eyes and my head haha
	- I got to a narration but the visuals and controls were totally unplayable
* Knockout League 7/11/2021
	- I love this game.  The polish on this is 10/10 and its so much fun.  It reminds me of punchout wii but way way better controls.  
	- I played it in 2018 and back then I felt clumsy because when I was dodging punches it was just me crouching down off to the left or right or something but this time I felt like i knew more where to dodge and I liked that. further I think its ok if thats what I do since crouching is effort too and jumping up after is too.  
	- I fought barrage and won pretty easily and had fun.
	- The cable is the only real problem and if I can use some tool to put the cable behind me (play facing the other dir) then I think I will play the heck out of this.
* Propagation VR 7/11/2021 Free
	- Apparently this game is free but its so good.  Its polished to perfection with great immersive horror movie cutscenes and tons of jumpscares and super creepy enemies and even dramatic bosses with different phases and attack patterns and stuff.
	- One of the 110% coolest things about this game is idk if you can die, which means I got like 897% bitten which I think means if they had done lives I would have died 8 times and barely survived but they just mark my score down at the end for getting hit so much and thats all it takes.  I loved it
	- The pistol and shotgun worked great the reloads were not too long but not too short.  Boy its fanatastic.
	- And the drama of the attack waves and patterns and bosses and cutscenes was hollywood level.
	- I'm decent at shooting games like this and it took me just under 40min to beat it.  I loved it all too. 
	- I would have paid $20 for that and not regretted it.  for $40 it would have felt too short but with a few other modes or challenges or achievements and maybe replay sections it might be worth that too.  And with a few more levels of that caliber I wouldn't regret $60 and recommend it as one of the best games in VR.

# Retroarch #
See WarioWare above for more on getting it working with Virtual Boy
For PSX I've sort of got it working but boy is it configured clunky.  It cuts off the sides of the screen so I can't actually double the size of the screen to get side by side.  theres got to be a setting to fix that.  I thought it would be Crop Horizontal Overscan butthat didnt work by itself.

1. Get your PSX Game going and Hit F1 -> Quick Menu -> Shaders
3. Set Shader Passes to 1
4. under Shader #0 select shaders/glsl/Stereoscopic3D/Side-By-Side-Simple.glsl or something like that
5. hit apply changes (maybe restart)
6. Save the current shader preset

Then as you need to change the presets
7. go in to a text editor and change the options
8. hit F1 ->Shaders->LoadShaderPreset and load the one you just edited.  Thats a quick iterative process

Some starting point:  this works a little but really not well but its not toally broken
eye_sep = "0.16000"
y_loc = "0.00000"
BOTH = "0.17000"
ana_zoom = "1.00000"
WIDTH = "2.00000"
HEIGHT = "1.00000"
warpX = "0.100000"
warpY = "0.000000"
pulfrich = "0.000000"

These settings work pretty well now!:
eye_sep = "0.20000"
y_loc = "0.00000"
BOTH = "0.17000"
ana_zoom = "1.00000"
WIDTH = "2.00000"
HEIGHT = "1.00000"
warpX = "0.000000"
warpY = "0.000000"
pulfrich = "0.000000"


Update: I may have success by changing the retroarch aspect ratio to 21:10.  No that didnt fix it.  I want to stretch the whole image to the edges of the window.  The eye separation matters a lot.  If its wrong then I look at the theater in BigScreen and its clear and then I look at the screen and have to cross my eyes to see the 3d.  its not in any known units but just a mathematical number.  .16 seems to get them apart but not apart enough.  BUT Incredibly Frustratingly: making it much bigger cuts off part of the image!

# Dolphin VR #


1. Important: After you install but before you start using add the file portable.txt to your dolphinvr folder.  Then it wont try to use a shared config with your main dolphin.
2. [Where to get it](https://dolphinvr.wordpress.com/downloads/) Yes its very old
3. Might want to use Pseudovive below
5. How to setup dolphin vr https://gamecrate.com/how-play-retro-games-vr-dolphin-vr/23568
6. Select OSVR Mode

When selecting the cheats and culling codes if you need to add more than are already in the properties menu of a given game then go here to the [culling codes subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DolphinVRcullin/)


Controls:
Use Xbox controller as gamecube controller or classic controller or keyboard and mouse.

Optional VR Controllers as Wiimote: How to use [Wiimote in DolphinVR](https://www.vrheads.com/dolphin-vr)
This is a good idea for some games but not all.  People are saying for mario galaxy mouse and keyboard is better.  For Metroid Prime xbox controller is better (frankly maybe mouse and keyboard is better for that too dont know) but to shoot in metroid prime with motion controls and have access to all of the functions the controller gives is tricky and people aren't much doing it.
"Prime 1/2 both work amazingly well, so well in fact I would dare call them essential VR experiences." - [from one of many interesting opinions on dolphin vr]

1. I kept getting an error: Invalid Sysconf
I had to delete it from this folder
C:\Users\user\Documents\Dolphin Emulator\Wii\shared2\sys
but when I did I realized that it might be a conf from my other version of dolphin.  

# Doom #
[GZDoomVR](https://github.com/hh79/gzdoomvr) releases on the right

0. Backup your .ini before starting any of this and all along the way 
1. Settings are in 3 places: normal controls actions menu, VR settings, and then controllers/openvr.  in VR Settings change so its not slidey (no momentum).  
2. add these [snap turn aliases](https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/cwry4b/brutal_doom_vr_oneclick_installpack_easy_setup_in/eykfsik/) 

``[Doom.ConsoleAliases]  
Name=turn45left  
Command=alias turn45_step "wait 5;-left;turnspeeds 640 1280 320 320;alias turn45_step";turn45_step;wait;turnspeeds 2048 2048 2048 2048;+left
Name=turn45right  
Command=alias turn45_step "wait 5;-right;turnspeeds 640 1280 320 320;alias turn45_step";turn45_step;wait;turnspeeds 2048 2048 2048 2048;+right  
 
[Doom.Bindings]  
rstickright=turn45right  
rstickleft=turn45left  ``

in my case it was 

``
Axis3Plus=turn45right
Axis3Minus=turn45left
``
and in Controllers/OpenVR I had to set the right stick horizontal axis to none
(I had already set all of the pads to none in that menu)

These dead zones helped too
``
[Joy:OpenVR]
Axis0deadzone=0.15
Axis0scale=0.8
Axis0map=-1
Axis2deadzone=0.15
Axis2scale=0.8
Axis2map=-1``

I also added some of these buttons to 
``
[Doom.Bindings]
LThumb=crouch
RShoulder=+jump
LTrigger=+use
RTrigger=+attack
LStickUp=+use
Axis3Plus=turn45right
Axis3Minus=turn45left
LStickRight=weapprev
LStickLeft=weapnext
``

To find out what axis is what I did it the long but certain way: go into the control actions menu and set some random things to those axes.  

Comments:
1. Menu Rotation
	1. When you are dead looking side to side is nauseating because the view is no longer freelook its stuck to your theoretically dead and therefore theoretically stationary face.  otoh looking vertical still works for some reason.
	2. When you are in the menu looking side to side is nauseating (probably the same problem as when you are dead
	3. For reasons like 1 and 2 this is super clunky and can't be recommended whole heartedly to everyone
	4. It almost looks like someone went to some lengths to program a feature where the menu stayed stuck in your view and thats the entire problem.  It should be a floating screen somewhere. The visuals should basically never be stuck to your head. I suspect they are using similar code for the hud as for the menu and maybe thats related.  The hud could be optionally floating too for me personally.  Maybe only if you look to your left do you see the hud?  That should be an option.
4. Its super weird to me how the menu square shears the opposite direction as you tilt your head. its disconcerting and slightly nauseating.  It should stay in one place at one size and perspective regardless of how you look at it.
5. For some reason the Left Trigger doesnt work for anything.  It doesnt recognize it in the mapping menu in game, and assigning it outside of the mapping menu doesnt work either. 
	1. I could have sworn it worked when I first downloaded this though to open doors. Maybe one of the old .ini files will work.  I tried getting it from github and it still didnt work.
	1. Assigning ``RTrigger=+attack`` works great assigning ``LTrigger=+attack`` doesnt work at all.  assigning ``LTrigger=+jump`` or ``LTrigger=jump`` doesnt work either (testing now)
	1. Nothing I do lets Doom see the left trigger for some reason.  It makes a click as if its still being only recognized by wmr or something
	2. Interesting the left trigger works as use in 4.2.4 (crouch doesnt but thats a different matter)  it was configured to use joy4 I wonder if thats why it works.  
	2. Oh it looks like that actually works!  yeah it did.  weird.
6. Weapon Models dont work well (shotgun is missing)
	1. 3D WeaponsForVR.pk3 work great in Doom ``gzdoomvr.exe -iwad doom.wad -file WeaponsForVR2.pk3 laser-sight-v0.6.pk3 lights.pk3`` but not necessarily in freedoom
	2. Lets try in freedoom ok at least the pistol works great in freedoom ``gzdoomvr.exe -iwad freedoom1.wad -file WeaponsForVR2.pk3`` havent tried the other weapons
	3. Lets try osiris well its got different gun models so it doesnt seem to work
7. Laser Sight not visible
	1. Changed a few settings and at least it showed up.  its not sticking directly out of the gun its offset a bit
	1. Works in Osiris too
	10. Laser beam is ugly and offset
	11. But if you turn the beam off and just the sight on it works perfect and is really useful I love that.
8. In 4.2.4 the way I have it configured anyway crouch didnt work :(  it works in 4.6
	1. it just goes low and then back up 
	2. Crouch works great in osiris and doom now.  Left Grip.  
9. Weapon switching isnt ideal or instaneous.  Its like they slide off and then come back in slowly.  
10.  Interesting that in Osiris the weapon models are backwards!  like they are pointing at the player haha.  Its clunky looking but no big deal
11. Osiris: Comments
	1. Does the red guys attack and drain your health that quick in ab3d?
	2. Config: I feel like its moving faster in here and doom than in freedoom.  Did some of the options not get applied?  is that due to increasing the scale and therefore I should slow the player down more?
	3. image Masking on the main shotgun frame is different than plasma rifle 
	4. Comment: Red enemies cant go down the stairs on level 2 entrance
	5. Very scary in the dark when enemies have bright eyes!
	6. Comment: Seems like level 3 has very few ammo pickups
	7. The under water effect is disconcerting in VR.  Can it be turned off in ini somewhere?
	8. There are a few textures that appear to move where others appear rock solid


# Games with Cristi #

Hell_Dimension_VR - like serious sam co op wave shooter


# Games that Don't work with WMR #

Games that dont work with wmr
* [NMS, LA Noir, and SmashBall Arena](https://www.reddit.com/r/WindowsMR/comments/cqkiqy/if_you_want_wmr_support_for_no_mans_sky_tell/) pseudovive fixes all three
* Tinertia works well with pseudovive in fact I beat the whole game and it performed flawlessly.
* KryptKrawler - specifially doesnt work with vive or wmr.  Launching in SteamVR mode doesnt even allow it to TRY VR.  it wont let me control it in any way or anything.

Pseudovive 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR
In theer copy the pseudovive/2vive folder into drivers and remove it when youre done


# SteamVR #
Simplest Steam project:
1. Empty Unity Project
2. Import latest SteamVR
3. Drag in the CameraRig prefab from SteamVR/Prefabs 
4. Turn on SteamVR
5. Hit Run
	* It will ask you a few questions just accept the defaults
6. Then you will be in a simple VR experience of your own!


# Using software in VR #
1. OVRDrop (complex)
2. OVR Toolkit
3. Virtual Desktop
4. BigScreen
5. VR Toolbox (Add lots of screens)
6. Built in Steam or Oculus Virtual Desktop in the menu

Puzzle for developing VR: You have to switch between SteamVR and your app and it will only let you run one app at once so if youre using a SteamVR app in VR and then run your game it will close your other SteamVR app ... well thats the puzzle anyway.  has that been fixed or worked around at all?

Watching SbS Movies and video

1. DeoVR
2. Virtual Desktop
3. Big Screen
4. VorpX

Big Screen Fullscreen Problem:
Interesting: Big Screen displays Citra's Full screen perfectly but wont display Dolphins full screen at all. 

Virtual Desktop Fullscreen Problem:
Virtual Desktop has the saame problem.
Virtual desktop in FullSbS  seems to cut the width of the screen in half.  Half SBS works perfectly.  Bigscreen always stretches back to normal.








# Controller Problems in WMR 6-27-2021 #
Twice in the last few months Ive had controller problems: WMR didnt recognize the controllers.  I couldn't remove them as bluetooth devices.  in the bluetooth menu if they say 'paired' then they might work but they need to say 'connected' to actually work.  If i go into device manager, uninstall them from PC->Bluetooth->MotionControllerLeft and then remove them from the bluetooth devices, then I can open the back panel, hold the sync button and they show up.
