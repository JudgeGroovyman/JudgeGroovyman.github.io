### NASA VR System ###

Had a stereoscopic HMD with wireframe graphics looks like about 20hz and has gloves and finger tracking with scaling graphics and moving things by grabbing them, has moving platforms, and shooting guns in 3d.

# Games & Experiences #

* The Talos Principle (10/1/19) - Wow this surprised me with greatness.  I was expecting quality since its croteam and I've had nothing but good experiences with their VR, but wow this is so immersive and fun and great.  The puzzles are going to get devious I can tell but the interface with the puzzles is just fantastic with no clumsiness or hiccups.  Theres great locomotion options for everyone and I just had a blast and am super impressed.  I beat 2 levels and died twice.  Thats a great game!
* Dont Knock Twice (10/2/19) This is really good.  It gave me some serious chills with one of the jump scares but mostly its a super creepy vibe and great scary game.  I probably played for 30 min and I have no idea if I missed things or what.  I didn't know where to go so I stopped but I suspect if I just did another once over of all of the places I could go I would figure out the next step.
* Cartoon Network Journeys VR (10/5/19) holy crap the jester thing is so cool because they did something Ive never heard before: they gave instructions and background in the form of a cute musical song when  you are about to start the level!  I love it so much!  oh and holy crap the jester game was so much fun!  It was so well scripted and entertaining and interesting.  The golden goose cannon!  hahaha!!!!  This is one of the best ever.
* Tinertia (10/9/19) I actually started playing this a long time ago (many months) but took some breaks in between but for the last few weeks I've been trying to beat just the final boss and have been trying to play a few minutes every day.  I finally beat him today and it was so satisfying!  Here's the review I wrote on Steam: Wow!  This is unexpectedly one of the best games I've ever played.  Its tough as nails but its one of the few games that really gets it right and the difficulty is completely fair.  The final level was brutal but thats how final levels are supposed to be.  To describe a typical gameplay later-level gameplay session a bit: you will start a level and 10 seconds in to the level you will die but then you will instantly restart (it doesn't belabor the process with any real delays) and you will get 15 seconds into the level and die, and so on and so forth until you beat it.  Off the top of my head each level is like 1-2min long so you're never taken back very far and there are checkpoints in the levels in fair places so you're never doing things too many times unfairly.  I am stressing fairness because so many difficult games are unfair and take you back too far when you die or make you start the game over or something absurd like that.  Well none of that happens here.  In this way it reminds me of the game VVVVVV which while in most other respects a completely different game had a similar continue structure.  Now to the gameplay: the controls are tight and interesting and fantastic.  In case you haven't heard you control movement generally (like walking and in air movement) with the left stick but the right stick shoots your rocket which is ultimately the primary method of locomotion so you'll be shooting that into walls and floors at precisely the right instant to get a big boost and go flying in the direction you intend (hopefully).  Its a great control scheme that is perfectly executed and is fun to learn and (by the end of the game) master.  The difficulty curve is great and it never gets too too hard (at least it didnt for me) and the longevity is great because after you beat the main campaign (which it looks like took me about 9hrs which is probably incredibly slow) there are a ton of procedurally generated levels and a couple other modes (speed run and boss rush) plus you can go back and try to beat each level of the campaign with less than a certain number of jumps or under a certain time par.  The graphics are amazing too with incredible detail and care taken to make the backgrounds and foregrounds look amazing and I absolutely love this 2.5d style.  I played the whole thing in VR and it was incredible and immersive to look around and see what was coming in 10-15 seconds and I think it gave me an advantage because I could see some of the obstacles in advance.  Well thats enough gushing but it was just fantastic.  P.S. If you want to play this with Windows Mixed Reality VR headsets just download 'pseudovive' which takes less than a minute to install and you'll be off and running.    Way to go Candescent games.  I just wonder why people aren't talking about this more.  
* Rez Infinite (10/9/19) I first played this about a month ago and it was great.  I actually beat the whole game and only then found out that you can fix the control scheme and man it is so much better!  If you change it from being dependent on where you look to just being aiming with the controller only its a completely different game and this should be the default option, however now that you know its real easy to change and it makes it one of the best games on the system.  If you like the idea of shooting things in a retro 3d sci-fi lawnmower man world with thumping beats then this is for you.  I love it so much with the new scheme I'll probably end up playign it again.  In fact I just played the first lievel and got 98.4% of enemies and didn't get hit once on the level boss.
* Chiaro and the Elixir of Life - This is a cool game and I think it could be really good.  I was using pseudovive on accident (I don't think thats required with this game) and perhaps as a result after the first scene I was stuck undergournd.  At least you can reset the ground level right?  Well then I just started falling for the next several minutes with the skybox and level all gettin gfurther and further above me.  I wasn't drawn in and didnt love it enough to continue right now but maybe another time.  It looked like it had tons of charm and the mechanics worked well and it looked like it could be a great experience and I've heard its got plenty of length. 
* Spiderman (11/17/19) If I'm not being picky then this was really great the swinging worked well and it gave you a fun feeling of swinging through new york and making a difference, and it had top quality voice actors which made you feel like you were in the movie and thats really what I have to say about it, but if you want to hear my picky opinion: it was a bit clumsy, particularly the part about the giant covered in road bits which it wasnt clear how to pull those off.  Thats just me being pick though and this is a really cool experience that everyone interested should play and will enjoy.
* The Gallery Starseed (11/22/19) This is really great.  I didnt solve any puzzles yet but I got to the top of the cave and played a tape in my cool 80s tape deck and played with my flashlight and broke some bottles and blinked all around rotating my playspace.  Its got some of the best controls in VR and one of the best cleverly and wonderfully narrated tutorials in VR.  This is highly recommended for anyone who wants a cool VR experience in another world and certainly for anyone who liked MYST.  I really haven't gotten into it at all and I actually suspect I'll get stumped on the puzzles pretty quickly but I'm looking forward to see how far I can get. 
* Overload (8/12/19) Started April 25, finished Aug 12.  This was a great game and the VR was fantastic.  If you like FPS controls then this is a wonderful purchase and it was worth every second I sunk into it and was so much fun.  It was addictive and rewarding.  The levels were sprawling and interesting and always surprising and it was fun to figure out how they worked and how to escape from each level.  There was always help like a hologram to show you the way to the exit and probably even show you the way to the next thing you had to do too.  There was one graphical glitch where it was washing white in one eye but not the other but I was able to clear it up by turning off some graphic or lighting setting (see judgegroovymans discussion on steam for the solution).
* Viral EX (12/18/19) I beat this earlier this year and this is one of the best games I've played in VR.  Now the reviews are a bit misleading because they imply that the bouncing balls is an enormous part of the game and its not, Its a part of the strategy for many levels sure, but really its a game of plotting out how to hit the things you need to hit.  Its got an excellent continue structure so its never annoying and it lets you try each level many times until you make the progress you want.  I got some top scores worldwide in the game on some levels!  
* Trackmania 12/18/19 - I beat this earlier this year and it is one of the best VR experiences I've had.  Obvious possible motion sickness aside (just play for one to five minutes per day and stop for the day and you'll be ok in a week or two).  I just loved looking around and seeing all of the awesome scenery go by so fast.  The graphics are great.  Complaints:  1.  Why can't we play the whole game in VR?  2. Its not clear up front that you have to play with xbox controller (touch controllers not supported but they seem to be but it will never work quite right) but once you start it works well.  3. Bugs like one of the levels starts you off way zoomed out and you have to play some of the game that way.  4. Why in the world can't we choose to play the whole game (even going through loops and everything) in first damn person?  There should be an option to turn off the pulling out to 3p mode.  Those are all minor considering the great time I had with it.  I got Gold or above on every level ... maybe I even did better than that?  I did really well.    For the record playing the whole game in the VR theater is actually still really fun and starts to feel like VR even if it isn't.  It works great.  
* Thumper - 12/18/19 This is such a cool rhythm game the only problem is its getting pretty hard and I'm only like 1/3 through.  I love looking around in VR.  Its really immersive and you can lose hours just racing and hitting buttons to the beat.
* Vertigo - 12/18/19 I beat this like a year ago and it was a really cool experience with awesome VR puzzles and some huge bosses and exciting battles and great use of VR all the way through.  Highly recommended.
* Hatchick - 12/18/19 This is one of the coolest shooters in VR which has the same control scheme as the shoooter game in the Lab, but this game has a cool funky chick vibe and some amazing bullet hell patterns to avoid with great shooting and its lots of fun.  I beat the whole game but would enjoy playing it again someday.  
* Serious Sam The Second Encounter (AKA Serious Sam 2 AKA Serious Sam TSE) this is amazing.  I love it so much the graphics are a big step up from the first one and there are so many cool instances where theres a (playing on hard mode) jump scare because an enemy comes from out of nowhere.  Its so damn cool.  Plus tehres save anywhere and quick save.  There are tons of cool weapons and lots of situations which you really have to work hard to survive with so many damn enemies everywhere.  One I got stuck on was a huge field where at the end of the field it went left and then there was another field going the other way.  I thought I had to plow through the enemies to make it to the left side but really I could just take them all out on the right side where there was more room and they werent spawning.  I actually felt so stuck I took a break for a few months but when I came back to it I just decided to see if I could take them out on the rigth hand side and sure engouh I could.  It was super fun after that.  I already beat the first game and had a blast.  One of the wonderful things about these games is how perfect for VR that they are since there are tons of huge enemies whos scope makes you feel like a tiny ant.  (especially the bosses).  I'm playing with sliding locomotion and you have to train yourself a bit to feel ok with any kind of sliding locomotion, but this game sometimes expects you to move really fast on hard mode but if you are using teleport  thats fine just start on the easiest mode and work up from there . Its a blast.  One of my favorite VR games.  Its long and interesting all the way through.  I love admiring the architecture which is something you could only do a fraction of as much in the flat game.
* Windlands 7/15/2020 - I have had to strap paper towels to my controllers because pretty quickly when playing this game my hands (and even feet) get slimy and drenched with sweat.  Its thrilling and exciting and scary too and I do experience trepidation, but less when I'm swinging and flying than when I'm walking around on a tiny platform or up tiny cliffsides or tree branches (since thats something I'm afraid to do irl) (i'm pretty afraid of heights even though they thrill me in case that wasnt clear).  I don't think my brain is too scared but my body sure is and it shows it through the sweats.  thats a testament to the scale and excitement that come with this game.  Its so cool to swing around but the swinging doesn't come real easy its actually a super hard game that is taking me several days to get any semblance of smoothness too, the levels are designed to give lots of options so there are probably ways to really fly through them but mostly I have to take them very carefully and judge my jumps and take one jump or swing at a time whenever I can.  Today I figured out and got ok at hanging from a point and then dropping from that point and when I was pretty far down shooting back up to that point which then pulled me up and launched me quite a bit higher than I originally was.  I also took an enormous dive off of a huge peak at the highest point in an area after I had scaled to the top and it was really a cool experience to fall from that height.  I think it took like 30s to get to the bottom (tehn again time can seem to expand in exciting situations like that).   7/18/2020 At the top of world 2 on the floating pirate ship theres a shitty problem: The pyramid goal trophy thing is high at the bow and theres some clear boards to get there but their colliders arent right and you fall right off of them.  You have to know to jump entirely over them.  You cant trust what you see which in the entire rest of the game you can adn thsi is a vulnerable moment where youve climbed to the top of the mountain.
* Space Harrier 3DS 7/17/2020 using Citra Emulator in SBS mode in BigScreen.  This is so amazing.  It is not virtual reality in the sense that I can look behind me and see the aliens flying off in the distance. Its also not first person virtual reality, but its an amazingly immersive and fantastic experience using 3D and VR hardware to create that experience.  Using Big Screen it feels like you are in a futuristic but comfortable fireplace heated livingroom with a huge floor to ceiling viewport.  I say viewport not screen because using SBS mode it seems like youre looking out a window into another world in this case the world of Space Harrier.  In some sense it is like you are on the deck of TNG Enterprise looking out into space, but it is in 3D so it looks like you could walk out of your livingroom and into the fantasy zone and go stand next to the Space Harrier.  Scale is incredible since the harrier is of a similar scale to a human which makes it easier to imagine yourself in that role and to see the immensity of the beasts and trees and rocks and ships as they come right up in to your face in the viewport is incredible.  Additionally since its wall/theater sized when you hit a tree or a huge robot and they are stuck right there in your face you have to look up to see the top of them and it conveys an amazing sense of scale and a sense of awe.  Depth this is adjsutable i set it to a settting of 12% since at 15% and larger, for my eyes, it started to make me focus significantly different when I was trying to keep the background in focus as well as the foreground.  None of it was broken at mroe than 15 and it probably did seem deeper, but at 12% I tried to estimate and if I think and analyze then my best guess it looks like the mountains in the back are 30ft away from the player which gives an incredible feeling of depth.  At one point I thought about it like I was playing with a whole set of flying interactive lifesized toys and I get to look into this toybox and shoot things.  Its so cool.  Another thought I had was that my movie theater (and believe me just as my real livingroom melts away when I go into the virtual movie theater, so does the virtual theater melt away when I go into the 3d virtual world of space harrier) is a tank moving quickly through the fantasy zone with a huge impenetrable glass viewport and the harrier is running and flying along just in front of the glass and doing his harri-ying(sp?) and I'm just there to watch.  I loved the whole thing.  More about this game in Games.md  Finally I find myself wanting to play as many stereoscopic 2.5d games in this setting as I can, its one of the coolest things ever.  I feel like I would rather play a game I've played before but in stereoscopic 3d or a game I didnt previously really want to play but if it were like this I would rather play it.  I feel like I want to play as many games in this situation as I can at the cost of many other situations.  Oh  yeah!  Another thing!  using the xbox controller there was actually dpad and control stick support and they complimented each other perfectly in this game: the control stick was better for moving all over the screen at a fast pace, but when I wanted to focus on one spot (bosses) or when I wanted to hit enemies that I knew were about to be in a particular place (those attack pattern enemies) then the dpad was better because it didnt recenter and would stay where you put it.  That was amazing to get the options to use it those two different ways.
* Wario Land Virtual Boy - 7/18/2020 - DL retroarch and load the Beetle core and the game and when the game is playing open the menu (F1) go to options and 3d mode and set it to SBS.  Now it works and its in 3D SBS!  F key to go exclusive full screen.  Note:  things in the distance are doubled so I need to change some settings somehow but dont know how.  In the retroarch folder theres shaders/glsl/stereoscopic-3d/side-by-side.glslp where you can set some parameters but I dont know if it reads them or not.  I just changed the eye distance to something wildly different and it didnt change in the emulator.  In fact I'm not sure its using these shaders for these games, maybe these are for like n64 or PSX games or something.  Maybe theres a more specific beetle setting?  Ok in Retroarch/Config/Beetle VB/ theres Beetle VB.opt and in the [documentation here](https://mednafen.github.io/documentation/vb.html) theres similar corresponding options to what are in this file (underscores replacing dots) so I'm going to try changing vb.sidebyside.separation to 10 and restart the core and see what changes.  I dont think it read in my setting because it looks exactly the same.  Update: When in Big Screen I move further back (like in the theater to the back of the theater) then while it doesnt look as cool imho, the things in the back of the 3d arent doubled up and look clearer.  Even then I have to refocus when looking in the front and back but at least its possible for me to do so.  Things I can try: Getting a retroarch Virtual Boy build from someone who has it working, or getting the underlying retroarch emulator working wihtout retroarch so I can set the settings manually (trying this now). Its pretty easy.  run it once Mednafen.exe and it makes a default config file with all options in it set.  In there change anaglyph to sbs and then I can change the sidebyside separation.  I put in 500 and it made the distance between the two entire views of the game real wide, I guess thats all it does.  I dont know if that is about to help with depth or not but I'll try 0, 10, 50, 100, 200 1000 see what happens.  Ok so theres a bit of a problem because it doesnt have any input devices setup apparently.  Ok so I've gotten used to the idea that I need to sit a little bit back from the screen.  I think they should offer a depth option in their emulator but they don't so thats ok.  I played the first level of wario and it was super fun!
* Lethal VR 6/9/2020
	- Although ultimately a target practice or shooting gallery game its really really cool and has a great leaderboard system that makes you want to try each event many times over to get the best score that you think you can get.  I suspect some cheating since the best scores are 5 times larger than mine and I got pretty high.  Its really fun and I want to get the best scores I think I can on the last few events (probably tomorrow) and call it done.  Worth the money.  I got in the top 1000 on several events and was really proud to get like 100% and very fast times sometimes.  Id say on several of the events (at least one in particular) reloading planning is the biggest slowdown of all. I got 101th place on one of the events and am pretty sure I could do better!
	
	

# Motion Sickness #
Cristi got through it.  The simplest way is to play something that makes you sick every day but don't expect to make progress, just subject your body to it for one to five minutes and then pull the headset off and put the game away.  In two weeks it should be a different ballgame entirely and you should be able to play a bunch. 

# Games that aren't obvious #
1. Heavy Metal FAKK2 (VorpX) - I haven't tried this but it sounds like tons of fun since I played this and had much fun with it for a while bitd.  I want to play this actually very much.
2. Doom3 (with an unofficial patch it apparently plays very well)
3. Doom 1,2 and Quake (Played through the whole first doom game and had tons of fun and have played several mods)
4. 3DS Emulator (Stereoscopic Support) DONE Citra is amazing for this
5. Dolphin Wii Emulator (Stereoscopic Support)
6. 3DSEN (VR NES Emulator with 3d applied to the sprites)
7. EMUVR (80s bedroom with a bunch of TVs, most precise way to experience 80s/90s light gun games)
8. Virtual Boy Emulation (possibly with a virtual boy emulator for 3DS? also emulated in citra)
9. Trinius https://www.trinusvirtualreality.com/trinus-dream/ converts normal games to sbs 
10. This Reshade sbs shader https://reshade.me/forum/shader-presentation/2128-3d-depth-map-based-stereoscopic-shader?start=1460\
11. Color Code might help with making 3d http://ogon3d.com/colorcode3d.htm
