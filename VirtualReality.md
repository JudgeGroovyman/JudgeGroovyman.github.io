# History of Virtual Reality #

### NASA VR System ###

Had a stereoscopic HMD with wireframe graphics looks like about 20hz and has gloves and finger tracking with scaling graphics and moving things by grabbing them, has moving platforms, and shooting guns in 3d.

# Games & Experiences #

* The Talos Principle (10/1/19) - Wow this surprised me with greatness.  I was expecting quality since its croteam and I've had nothing but good experiences with their VR, but wow this is so immersive and fun and great.  The puzzles are going to get devious I can tell but the interface with the puzzles is just fantastic with no clumsiness or hiccups.  Theres great locomotion options for everyone and I just had a blast and am super impressed.  I beat 2 levels and died twice.  Thats a great game!
* Dont Knock Twice (10/2/19) This is really good.  It gave me some serious chills with one of the jump scares but mostly its a super creepy vibe and great scary game.  I probably played for 30 min and I have no idea if I missed things or what.  I didn't know where to go so I stopped but I suspect if I just did another once over of all of the places I could go I would figure out the next step.
* Cartoon Network Journeys VR (10/5/19) holy crap the jester thing is so cool because they did something Ive never heard before: they gave instructions and background in the form of a cute musical song when  you are about to start the level!  I love it so much!  oh and holy crap the jester game was so much fun!  It was so well scripted and entertaining and interesting.  The golden goose cannon!  hahaha!!!!  This is one of the best ever.
* Tinertia (10/9/19) I actually started playing this a long time ago (many months) but took some breaks in between but for the last few weeks I've been trying to beat just the final boss and have been trying to play a few minutes every day.  I finally beat him today and it was so satisfying!  Here's the review I wrote on Steam: Wow!  This is unexpectedly one of the best games I've ever played.  Its tough as nails but its one of the few games that really gets it right and the difficulty is completely fair.  The final level was brutal but thats how final levels are supposed to be.  To describe a typical gameplay later-level gameplay session a bit: you will start a level and 10 seconds in to the level you will die but then you will instantly restart (it doesn't belabor the process with any real delays) and you will get 15 seconds into the level and die, and so on and so forth until you beat it.  Off the top of my head each level is like 1-2min long so you're never taken back very far and there are checkpoints in the levels in fair places so you're never doing things too many times unfairly.  I am stressing fairness because so many difficult games are unfair and take you back too far when you die or make you start the game over or something absurd like that.  Well none of that happens here.  In this way it reminds me of the game VVVVVV which while in most other respects a completely different game had a similar continue structure.  Now to the gameplay: the controls are tight and interesting and fantastic.  In case you haven't heard you control movement generally (like walking and in air movement) with the left stick but the right stick shoots your rocket which is ultimately the primary method of locomotion so you'll be shooting that into walls and floors at precisely the right instant to get a big boost and go flying in the direction you intend (hopefully).  Its a great control scheme that is perfectly executed and is fun to learn and (by the end of the game) master.  The difficulty curve is great and it never gets too too hard (at least it didnt for me) and the longevity is great because after you beat the main campaign (which it looks like took me about 9hrs which is probably incredibly slow) there are a ton of procedurally generated levels and a couple other modes (speed run and boss rush) plus you can go back and try to beat each level of the campaign with less than a certain number of jumps or under a certain time par.  The graphics are amazing too with incredible detail and care taken to make the backgrounds and foregrounds look amazing and I absolutely love this 2.5d style.  I played the whole thing in VR and it was incredible and immersive to look around and see what was coming in 10-15 seconds and I think it gave me an advantage because I could see some of the obstacles in advance.  Well thats enough gushing but it was just fantastic.  P.S. If you want to play this with Windows Mixed Reality VR headsets just download 'pseudovive' which takes less than a minute to install and you'll be off and running.    Way to go Candescent games.  I just wonder why people aren't talking about this more.  
* Rez Infinite (10/9/19) I first played this about a month ago and it was great.  I actually beat the whole game and only then found out that you can fix the control scheme and man it is so much better!  If you change it from being dependent on where you look to just being aiming with the controller only its a completely different game and this should be the default option, however now that you know its real easy to change and it makes it one of the best games on the system.  If you like the idea of shooting things in a retro 3d sci-fi lawnmower man world with thumping beats then this is for you.  I love it so much with the new scheme I'll probably end up playign it again.  In fact I just played the first lievel and got 98.4% of enemies and didn't get hit once on the level boss.
* Chiaro and the Elixir of Life - This is a cool game and I think it could be really good.  I was using pseudovive on accident (I don't think thats required with this game) and perhaps as a result after the first scene I was stuck undergournd.  At least you can reset the ground level right?  Well then I just started falling for the next several minutes with the skybox and level all gettin gfurther and further above me.  I wasn't drawn in and didnt love it enough to continue right now but maybe another time.  It looked like it had tons of charm and the mechanics worked well and it looked like it could be a great experience and I've heard its got plenty of length. 
* Spiderman (11/17/19) If I'm not being picky then this was really great the swinging worked well and it gave you a fun feeling of swinging through new york and making a difference, and it had top quality voice actors which made you feel like you were in the movie and thats really what I have to say about it, but if you want to hear my picky opinion: it was a bit clumsy, particularly the part about the giant covered in road bits which it wasnt clear how to pull those off.  Thats just me being pick though and this is a really cool experience that everyone interested should play and will enjoy.
* The Gallery Starseed (11/22/19) This is really great.  I didnt solve any puzzles yet but I got to the top of the cave and played a tape in my cool 80s tape deck and played with my flashlight and broke some bottles and blinked all around rotating my playspace.  Its got some of the best controls in VR and one of the best cleverly and wonderfully narrated tutorials in VR.  This is highly recommended for anyone who wants a cool VR experience in another world and certainly for anyone who liked MYST.  I really haven't gotten into it at all and I actually suspect I'll get stumped on the puzzles pretty quickly but I'm looking forward to see how far I can get. 
* Overload (8/12/19) Started April 25, finished Aug 12.  This was a great game and the VR was fantastic.  If you like FPS controls then this is a wonderful purchase and it was worth every second I sunk into it and was so much fun.  It was addictive and rewarding.  The levels were sprawling and interesting and always surprising and it was fun to figure out how they worked and how to escape from each level.  There was always help like a hologram to show you the way to the exit and probably even show you the way to the next thing you had to do too.  There was one graphical glitch where it was washing white in one eye but not the other but I was able to clear it up by turning off some graphic or lighting setting (see judgegroovymans discussion on steam for the solution).
* Viral EX (12/18/19) I beat this earlier this year and this is one of the best games I've played in VR.  Now the reviews are a bit misleading because they imply that the bouncing balls is an enormous part of the game and its not, Its a part of the strategy for many levels sure, but really its a game of plotting out how to hit the things you need to hit.  Its got an excellent continue structure so its never annoying and it lets you try each level many times until you make the progress you want.  I got some top scores worldwide in the game on some levels!  
* Trackmania 12/18/19 - I beat this earlier this year and it is one of the best VR experiences I've had.  Obvious possible motion sickness aside (just play for one to five minutes per day and stop for the day and you'll be ok in a week or two).  I just loved looking around and seeing all of the awesome scenery go by so fast.  The graphics are great.  Complaints:  1.  Why can't we play the whole game in VR?  2. Its not clear up front that you have to play with xbox controller (touch controllers not supported but they seem to be but it will never work quite right) but once you start it works well.  3. Bugs like one of the levels starts you off way zoomed out and you have to play some of the game that way.  4. Why in the world can't we choose to play the whole game (even going through loops and everything) in first damn person?  There should be an option to turn off the pulling out to 3p mode.  Those are all minor considering the great time I had with it.  I got Gold or above on every level ... maybe I even did better than that?  I did really well.    For the record playing the whole game in the VR theater is actually still really fun and starts to feel like VR even if it isn't.  It works great.  
* Thumper - 12/18/19 This is such a cool rhythm game the only problem is its getting pretty hard and I'm only like 1/3 through.  I love looking around in VR.  Its really immersive and you can lose hours just racing and hitting buttons to the beat.
* Vertigo - 12/18/19 I beat this like a year ago and it was a really cool experience with awesome VR puzzles and some huge bosses and exciting battles and great use of VR all the way through.  Highly recommended.
* Hatchick - 12/18/19 This is one of the coolest shooters in VR which has the same control scheme as the shoooter game in the Lab, but this game has a cool funky chick vibe and some amazing bullet hell patterns to avoid with great shooting and its lots of fun.  I beat the whole game but would enjoy playing it again someday.  


# Motion Sickness #
Cristi got through it.  The simplest way is to play something that makes you sick every day but don't expect to make progress, just subject your body to it for one to five minutes and then pull the headset off and put the game away.  In two weeks it should be a different ballgame entirely and you should be able to play a bunch. 

# Games that aren't obvious #
1. Heavy Metal FAKK2 (VorpX) - I haven't tried this but it sounds like tons of fun since I played this and had much fun with it for a while bitd.  I want to play this actually very much.
2. Doom3 (with an unofficial patch it apparently plays very well)
3. Doom 1,2 and Quake (Played through the whole first doom game and had tons of fun and have played several mods)
4. 


# Games that Don't work with WMR #

Games that dont work with wmr
* [NMS, LA Noir, and SmashBall Arena](https://www.reddit.com/r/WindowsMR/comments/cqkiqy/if_you_want_wmr_support_for_no_mans_sky_tell/) pseudovive fixes all three
* Tinertia works well with pseudovive in fact I beat the whole game and it performed flawlessly.

# SteamVR #
Simplest Steam project:
1. Empty Unity Project
2. Import latest SteamVR
3. Drag in the CameraRig prefab from SteamVR/Prefabs 
4. Turn on SteamVR
5. Hit Run
	* It will ask you a few questions just accept the defaults
6. Then you will be in a simple VR experience of your own!
