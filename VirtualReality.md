### NASA VR System ###

Had a stereoscopic HMD with wireframe graphics looks like about 20hz and has gloves and finger tracking with scaling graphics and moving things by grabbing them, has moving platforms, and shooting guns in 3d.

# Games & Experiences #

* The Talos Principle (10/1/19) - Wow this surprised me with greatness.  I was expecting quality since its croteam and I've had nothing but good experiences with their VR, but wow this is so immersive and fun and great.  The puzzles are going to get devious I can tell but the interface with the puzzles is just fantastic with no clumsiness or hiccups.  Theres great locomotion options for everyone and I just had a blast and am super impressed.  I beat 2 levels and died twice.  Thats a great game!
* Dont Knock Twice (10/2/19) This is really good.  It gave me some serious chills with one of the jump scares but mostly its a super creepy vibe and great scary game.  I probably played for 30 min and I have no idea if I missed things or what.  I didn't know where to go so I stopped but I suspect if I just did another once over of all of the places I could go I would figure out the next step.
* Cartoon Network Journeys VR (10/5/19) holy crap the jester thing is so cool because they did something Ive never heard before: they gave instructions and background in the form of a cute musical song when  you are about to start the level!  I love it so much!  oh and holy crap the jester game was so much fun!  It was so well scripted and entertaining and interesting.  The golden goose cannon!  hahaha!!!!  This is one of the best ever.
