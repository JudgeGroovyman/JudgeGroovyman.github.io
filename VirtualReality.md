### NASA VR System ###

Had a stereoscopic HMD with wireframe graphics looks like about 20hz and has gloves and finger tracking with scaling graphics and moving things by grabbing them, has moving platforms, and shooting guns in 3d.

# Games & Experiences #

* The Talos Principle (10/1/19) - Wow this surprised me with greatness.  I was expecting quality since its croteam and I've had nothing but good experiences with their VR, but wow this is so immersive and fun and great.  The puzzles are going to get devious I can tell but the interface with the puzzles is just fantastic with no clumsiness or hiccups.  Theres great locomotion options for everyone and I just had a blast and am super impressed.  I beat 2 levels and died twice.  Thats a great game!
* Dont Knock Twice (10/2/19) This is really good.  It gave me some serious chills with one of the jump scares but mostly its a super creepy vibe and great scary game.  I probably played for 30 min and I have no idea if I missed things or what.  I didn't know where to go so I stopped but I suspect if I just did another once over of all of the places I could go I would figure out the next step.
* Cartoon Network Journeys VR (10/5/19) holy crap the jester thing is so cool because they did something Ive never heard before: they gave instructions and background in the form of a cute musical song when  you are about to start the level!  I love it so much!  oh and holy crap the jester game was so much fun!  It was so well scripted and entertaining and interesting.  The golden goose cannon!  hahaha!!!!  This is one of the best ever.
* Tinertia (10/9/19) I actually started playing this a long time ago (many months) but took some breaks in between but for the last few weeks I've been trying to beat just the final boss and have been trying to play a few minutes every day.  I finally beat him today and it was so satisfying!  Here's the review I wrote on Steam: Wow!  This is unexpectedly one of the best games I've ever played.  Its tough as nails but its one of the few games that really gets it right and the difficulty is completely fair.  The final level was brutal but thats how final levels are supposed to be.  To describe a typical gameplay later-level gameplay session a bit: you will start a level and 10 seconds in to the level you will die but then you will instantly restart (it doesn't belabor the process with any real delays) and you will get 15 seconds into the level and die, and so on and so forth until you beat it.  Off the top of my head each level is like 1-2min long so you're never taken back very far and there are checkpoints in the levels in fair places so you're never doing things too many times unfairly.  I am stressing fairness because so many difficult games are unfair and take you back too far when you die or make you start the game over or something absurd like that.  Well none of that happens here.  In this way it reminds me of the game VVVVVV which while in most other respects a completely different game had a similar continue structure.  Now to the gameplay: the controls are tight and interesting and fantastic.  In case you haven't heard you control movement generally (like walking and in air movement) with the left stick but the right stick shoots your rocket which is ultimately the primary method of locomotion so you'll be shooting that into walls and floors at precisely the right instant to get a big boost and go flying in the direction you intend (hopefully).  Its a great control scheme that is perfectly executed and is fun to learn and (by the end of the game) master.  The difficulty curve is great and it never gets too too hard (at least it didnt for me) and the longevity is great because after you beat the main campaign (which it looks like took me about 9hrs which is probably incredibly slow) there are a ton of procedurally generated levels and a couple other modes (speed run and boss rush) plus you can go back and try to beat each level of the campaign with less than a certain number of jumps or under a certain time par.  The graphics are amazing too with incredible detail and care taken to make the backgrounds and foregrounds look amazing and I absolutely love this 2.5d style.  I played the whole thing in VR and it was incredible and immersive to look around and see what was coming in 10-15 seconds and I think it gave me an advantage because I could see some of the obstacles in advance.  Well thats enough gushing but it was just fantastic.  P.S. If you want to play this with Windows Mixed Reality VR headsets just download 'pseudovive' which takes less than a minute to install and you'll be off and running.    Way to go Candescent games.  I just wonder why people aren't talking about this more.  
* Rez Infinite (10/9/19) I first played this about a month ago and it was great.  I actually beat the whole game and only then found out that you can fix the control scheme and man it is so much better!  If you change it from being dependent on where you look to just being aiming with the controller only its a completely different game and this should be the default option, however now that you know its real easy to change and it makes it one of the best games on the system.  If you like the idea of shooting things in a retro 3d sci-fi lawnmower man world with thumping beats then this is for you.  I love it so much with the new scheme I'll probably end up playign it again.  In fact I just played the first lievel and got 98.4% of enemies and didn't get hit once on the level boss.
* Chiaro and the Elixir of Life - This is a cool game and I think it could be really good.  I was using pseudovive on accident (I don't think thats required with this game) and perhaps as a result after the first scene I was stuck undergournd.  At least you can reset the ground level right?  Well then I just started falling for the next several minutes with the skybox and level all gettin gfurther and further above me.  I wasn't drawn in and didnt love it enough to continue right now but maybe another time.  It looked like it had tons of charm and the mechanics worked well and it looked like it could be a great experience and I've heard its got plenty of length.
