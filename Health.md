Pain Threshold vs Pain Tolerance:
High Pain Tolerance is withstanding a lot of pain.  Pain threshold is how much stress does your body have to go through before you start registering (feeling) the beginnings of the pain.  They are kind of opposites.

Imagine as your body and muscles go through stresses (between 1 and 10) and start sending signals of those stresses back to your nervous system and brain, at what point 1-10 does your brain register those stresses and signals as 'pain'?  2?  5?  8?  (thats your pain threshold).
Once they begin to register as pain, how much can you experience and live with and survive and endure before nope-ing out?  (thats your pain tolerance).

My Theory: Something about the nervous system or body chemistry varies and determines our pain threshold such that even as kids they dont feel pain as early.   Imagine that Tom has a pain threshold of 2 (PT2) and Sam has a pain threshold of 7 (PT7).  Tom and Sam are playing in the sandbox in the same way and both of their muscles are doing the same motions but soon those signals begin to register to Tom (PT2) as pain and he will begin to do less and less scooping and stacking and standing and crouching and leaning and twisting, where Sam(PT7)s muscles dont register as pain yet so he keeps going (thereby naturally and without trying building more basic muscles than Tom(PT2)).  
This applies to the heart as well so over time Sam (PT7)s heart will gain more power and enable him to naturally and without trying to do active physical things longer and generate even more natural muscle, so these things snowball.

Theres a big catch that amplifies this in both directions: when you are building muscle there is a natural level of soreness associated with (as I understand it) the tearing and healing/building/rebuilding of those muscles and that soreness can register as pain.  It typically builds over time and then lessens in a curve like the shell of a turtle (likely weighted towards the earlier side), for SamPT7 as that turtle shell peaks he experiences the soreness as pain but then it restores back down to below 7 and he experiences it as simple soreness sensation again.  For TomPT2 The entire turtle shell is experienced as pain.  This matters for two reasons 1 (less significant) this means the whole process of doing the workout and the healing from it is more unpleasant for Tom PT2 than Sam PT7, but 2 (Much more important) is sleep: if your body is experiencing pain it wont/cant sleep as deep as it could/would otherwise, you might even fall asleep just fine but your body needs deep sleep to truly restore itself and heal itself and grow and thrive, so for SamPT7 the night after he has worked out his body has already ceased sending pain signals and he gets deep sleep, his muscles recover and the pain goes away faster and he is well rested and able to work out the next day, otoh for TomPT2 the pain is still being experienced by his body/brain/nervous system and the deep sleep doesnt happen as much or as deep as is needed to heal/restore those muscles quickly plus he doesnt get the deep sleep he needs to have the basic energy and alertness he needs the next day to get a good active workout then.

caveats: 
1. fortunately this soreness lessens over time as your muscles strengthen so this can be somewhat overcome in time for Tom but the process is vastly different with higher interference with his life.
2. these things are averages so its not that every active day leads to bad sleep, but just that the advantages and disadavantages snowball and build in both directions.

Making Adderall last longer: 
Making it last longer and stronger is called potentiation and can of course be dangerous.  

[Potentiating Adderall](https://summithelps.com/adderall/potentiation/)
1. Eating breakfast prior
2. Avoiding Citrus and vitamin C
3. Baking soda to increase PH in stomach can lead to faster absorption, TUMS can too.  This can take the extended release and more closely mirror the rapid-onset.
4. Caffeine adds more of its own stimulation
5. L-Tyrosine is a dopamine building block and an Amino Acid precursor and can contribute to the stimulation
6. Nicotine - apparently this can cross-potentiate with Adderall


Positive results from this article: [Natural Alternatives to Adderall](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4757677/)

1. Panax quinquefolium (200 mg) (a type of Ginseng see below), and Ginkgo biloba extracts (50 mg)
2. Ritalin with Yizhi mixture (a combination of 10 herbs designed to affect Yin/Yang liver functions) - More improvement and less side effects Ritalin alone.
3. zinc sulfate 
4. acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) - significantly helps with Hyper and Poor social behaviour by increasing acetylcholine and stimulating it and dopamine
4. Magnesium and B6
5. a 36 ingredient micronutrient titration up to max dose of 15 capsules a day showed significant improvements (EMPowerplus1).  Table one is a list but its nothing weird just the standard vits lots of B and the standard minerals.
6. Rhodiola stimulates CNS Activity and is antifatigue and antianxiety and seratonin.  Few if any side effects.
7. YY162 (processed from ginko biloba and ginseng) comparable to the results from Ritalin.  Dont see how to get this though anywhere
8. BEST Bacopa 93% reduction of restlessness!  Learning, memory, concentration too.  Significant improvmeent. 225mg/day for 6 months.
9. Ningdong granule (NDG) widely used Chinese - as effective as Ritalin!
10. Valerian helps with GABA which helps with anxiety and restlessness
11. Ginkgo biloba, 240mg of Ginko 
12. Ginkgo with Ginseng (50mg/200mg) significant improvement, also lasted for up to 4 weeks after.  Some emotional side effects possible, with tired and sweating possible ()
14. Pycnogenol - lasted for 1 month after, minimal side effects.  Antioxidant levels lasted 
15. Antioxidants of all varieties (see Pycnogenol in the article) Oxidative stress is believed to be a contributing factor.


me and her:
L-Tyrosine, Bacopa, Valerian, GABA, Ginkgo biloba(50-250mg), Ginseng(200mg), Pycnogenol, CoQ10, AlphaLipolic Acid (<600mg/day) 

Treat Wart every day for the rest of 2020, Castor Oil

(Pull or lower the ginkgo and giseng if side effects)

Best Antioxidants: 
https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/natural-powerful-antioxidants

1. Vitamin C?  (Water soluble so take it with water)
2. Vitamin E (Fat soluble so take it with fats)
2. Oregano Oil, 
3. Hydroxytyrosol, 
4. CoQ10, (50-1200mg/day - best with 1200) (fat soluable so take it with meals containing a little bit of fat) 
5. Lycopene & other Carotenoids
6. Alpha Lipoic Acid - 600mg/day is normal in Europe for therapys.  speeds the removal of glucose from the bloodstream(partly by inhancing insulin function) and reduces insulin resistance.  Natural in Red Meat.  
7. Green Tea



# Brain Muscle/Connective Tissue relationship #
1. Work out my back to make it very strong



# Digestion, leaky gut, and healing the gut lining #
1. Castor Oil (easiest & best)
2. GAPS diet with bone broth and meat with a specific difficult diet for several months
3. 



digestive superfoods
cabbage (because of Lglutamine)
L-Glutamine shields from mycotoxins (5000mg of lglutamine)
Marshmallow (with lglutamine nourish and protect and soothe the gut)
Capers (because of quercetin) (need 500mg of quercatin a day)

# High Blood Pressure #

## Familiar advice ##
1. Walk and exercise regularly
2. Reduce your sodium intake: [A low sodium diet > two bp meds](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/6-natural-ways-to-lower-blood-pressure/) When foods begin to taste too salty after a few weeks youll know its working
3. Drink less alcohol
4. Cut back on caffeine
5. dark chocolate or cocoa (rich in flavonoids cause blood vessels to dilate)

## Unfamiliar advice ##
1. Eat more potassium 
2. Eat more magnesium
3. Isometric Exercises (tension without moving) initially increases bp during but later [falls and remains lower](https://www.considerable.com/health/heart-disease/lower-blood-pressure/)
4. [Hand Grip Exercises](https://www.considerable.com/health/heart-disease/lower-blood-pressure/) Squeeze at 30% of your max for 2 min then switch hands then switch again then switch again. 8 min total.  Ive got that hand grip device btw.  Get another if necessary.
5. [Dash Diet](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16907-dash-diet?_ga=2.262540623.2124432749.1581822044-170467085.1581821123) lowered bp significantly in studies - this is vegetarian and low fat dairy
6. [half of people return from this retreat medication free](https://www.pritikin.com/how-long-lower-blood-pressure) its just restrictive diet and exercise

## Possible Supplements ##
1. Aged garlic extract
2. Berberine: Ayurvedic and Chinese, increases nitric oxide production which helps
3. Whey protein: In [a study](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/104/6/1534/4564684) whey protein improved blood pressure in 38 people.
4. Fish oil: Commonly known to be one of the best
5. Hibiscus Tea: anthocyanins and polyphenols to help lower bp

## Recommendation ##

Totally New things:
1. Add in 3g potassium supplement (gets rid of sodium)
3. Fish Oils for Omega-3s
4. Oat Bran/Oat Meal with Banans and Almonds

Generally:
1. Be sure to attend to taking Thyroid meds (super important)

When BP:
2. Dark Chocolate (maybe dark cocoa?)
3. Hibiscus Tea: 


Practices:
1. Walking
2. Meditation Box Breathing 

Advice:
1. If you dont get enough deep sleep your bp will be higher than it needs to be
2. Less Sodium, caffeine which both spike bp.
3. Given sodium spikes your bp: Salty Popcorn and firehouse subs ... I dont know ... Its interesting that your body has been craving that sodium though ... hmm ...



## Investigate ##
2. Find what oat bran does and how fast it works.  Hmm it helps with Cholesterol ... 


# Peri-menopausal heavy periods #
Called peri-menopause the lead up to the moment of menopause is often accompanied by heavy bleeding and anaemia.  Its caused by an imbalance between estrogen and progesterone the interplay of the two makes the period happen properly.  Both increase the uterine lining but since sometimes in perimenopause an egg is not released (which is what triggers the progesterone) when the estrogen is still produced by the ovaries theres an imbalance.

Menopause is 12 consecutive months of no period.  Symptoms start up to 4 years before last period and end up to 4 years after.  Median age is 51.  5 percent experience menopause between 40-45. 


## Exacerbation ##
- Stress causes hormone changes which is the last thing you need.
- Caffeine and Refined Sugar may make heavy periods more likely.
- Conditions that affect the ovaries like Cancer or hysterectomy or smoking.
- Dehydration 
	- blood is only a portion of what comes out and water is required to replenish blood and tissue
	- decreased blood volume will increase blood thickness which contributes to the heaviness and longevity of the flow
	- also creates dehydration
- Magnesium promotes estrogen creation and therefore reduces estrogen dominance which is a common cause of heavy periods
- B6 supports the liver in processing excess hormones
- Insulin thickens the uterine lining (which means theres more to shed) therefore sugar should be avoided
- Iodine - much of it in the body is stored in the ovaries where iodine plays a key role in reducing estrogen dominance


## Helping ##
- Keep iron levels high.  take an iron tonic.  
- Vitamin C helps with iron absorption and helps capillaries to help bleeding
- Exercise 20min to keep energy high, and get better sleep,
- [Yoga for Menopause](https://www.healthline.com/health/yoga-for-menopause#1)
- [Box Breathing](https://www.healthline.com/health/box-breathing)
- Hydration (see dehydration above)
- [Backstrap Molasses](https://www.bloodandmilk.com/the-best-diy-remedies-to-manage-a-heavy-flow/) iron and also magnesium
- Placing a cold pack on abdomen causes constriction of blood vessels
- Avoid Sugar (since that stimulates insulin) 

If its really heavy and not directly related to monthly then it may be uterine fibroids or polyps.
1. https://www.healthline.com/health/fibroids-natural-treatment "Guizhi fuling or Gui Zhi Fu Ling Tang. This formula contains several herbs that act to shrink uterine fibroids, balance hormone levels, and keep your uterus healthy""






## Doctor ##
- Visit a doctor if the bleeding lasts over 1 week
- A contraceptive pill might help with hormone regulation
- prescribed Hormone Therapy might influence hormones during the period
- The best reason to visit a doctor is to rule out the very serious: Endometriosis, Ademyosis, or Fybroids (little benign tumors) or cysts (noncancerous tissue).
- Is essure make heavy bleeding worse?

### Endometriosis ###
- Belly pain (and worse around period) (noc)
- Back pain or leg pain
- Pain during or after sex
- Pain on toilet
- Short Cycles less than 27 days (28c)
- Heavy periods lasting more than a week
- Started period before 11yo (12c)

Sometimes MRI can show, surgery required to be sure
Doesnt require treatment except to the degree that it causes problems

### Ademyosis ###
Risk factors:
- Started Period under 10yo
- Short Menstural cycles (less than 24 days)

Tenderness when you push on belly.  Often not found until hysterectomy
Doesnt require treatment except to the degree that it causes problems

## Inducing Menopause ##
- Ovarian ablation
- Shutdown of ovary funciton with HRT or radiation or tumor
- Surgical removal of the ovaries

# Detox #

## Heavy Metal Detox ##
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2szUwSYAKo&t=3s
Heavy Metals are shaken loose by PEMF

From the video:
Detox Phase 1
Convert heavy metals into water soluble elements in preparation for detox phase 2
Detox Phase 1.5 
Chelate and bind those metals so they can be disposed of properly and dont reattach to cells (take binders)
Detox Phase 2
Eliminate heavy metals through
kidney / urine or liver / stool / skin

If Herxheimer is too strong either slowing down phase 1, or increase phase 1.5 (theres no problem with sort of overdoing this part).  

https://www.sophianutrition.com/blogs/sophia-life-blog/are-you-detoxing-with-the-correct-binders

1. Magnetic Clay / Edible Clay
2. Zeolite / ACZ Spray
3. Modified Citrus Pectin
4. Chlorella
5. Activated Charcoal

Detoxing through the skin
1. Fine Infrared Sauna dome
2. Clay bath
3. Hyperthermia
4. Oil Pulling
5. Poultice
6. Exercise
7. Skin Brushing

Health Research 

- Alkalyzed Water
  - It should be noted that there is a significant difference between alkaline water, that which is made by chemical means which may be harmful to the body and ALKALYZED water which is made by passing an electrical current through the water thereby also creating a strong negative (-700 to -850) ORP (oxygen reduction principle). This negative ORP attracts the positivly charged free radicals in the body and starts breaking down the free radicals to the point where they the body is now able to flush them out naturally. This process is known as HOMEOSTASIS. It should also be pointed out that Alkalyzed water is also the most powerful antioxidant known to mankind. More pertinent information on ERW (electrolyzed reduced water) can be found by going to Google Scholar, which is a sub search engine of Google and typing in “Electrolyzed Reduced Water” or by visiting Pubmed.com and doing the same. Here you can find a great deal of information on what the Japanese have discovered to be the best kept secret the world has ever not known. My mom was working with this technology back in the early 60’s and had Russia not invaded our homeland (the Czech Republic, Czechoslovakia as known back then) which forced us to flee for obvious reasons, we would have been able to perfect this method of helping the body to heal itself with the assistance of alkalyzed water as it was having a staggeringly positive effect on her patients. Many hospitals throughout Asia, and Europe are utilizing this technology however it still remains relatively unknown in North America. Dor more information on this, please feel to contact me at tomsemail6646@gmail.com and I’ll do what I can to help. I hope this information was of value to you.
