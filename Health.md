# High Blood Pressure #

## Familiar advice ##
1. Walk and exercise regularly
2. Reduce your sodium intake: [A low sodium diet > two bp meds](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/6-natural-ways-to-lower-blood-pressure/) When foods begin to taste too salty after a few weeks youll know its working
3. Drink less alcohol
4. Cut back on caffeine
5. dark chocolate or cocoa (rich in flavonoids cause blood vessels to dilate)

## Unfamiliar advice ##
1. Eat more potassium 
2. Eat more magnesium
3. Isometric Exercises (tension without moving) initially increases bp during but later [falls and remains lower](https://www.considerable.com/health/heart-disease/lower-blood-pressure/)
4. [Hand Grip Exercises](https://www.considerable.com/health/heart-disease/lower-blood-pressure/) Squeeze at 30% of your max for 2 min then switch hands then switch again then switch again. 8 min total.  Ive got that hand grip device btw.  Get another if necessary.
5. [Dash Diet](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16907-dash-diet?_ga=2.262540623.2124432749.1581822044-170467085.1581821123) lowered bp significantly in studies - this is vegetarian and low fat dairy
6. [half of people return from this retreat medication free](https://www.pritikin.com/how-long-lower-blood-pressure) its just restrictive diet and exercise

## Possible Supplements ##
1. Aged garlic extract
2. Berberine: Ayurvedic and Chinese, increases nitric oxide production which helps
3. Whey protein: In [a study](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/104/6/1534/4564684) whey protein improved blood pressure in 38 people.
4. Fish oil: Commonly known to be one of the best
5. Hibiscus Tea: anthocyanins and polyphenols to help lower bp

## Recommendation ##

Totally New things:
1. Add in 3g potassium supplement (gets rid of sodium)
3. Fish Oils for Omega-3s
4. Oat Bran/Oat Meal with Banans and Almonds

Generally:
1. Be sure to attend to taking Thyroid meds (super important)

When BP:
2. Dark Chocolate (maybe dark cocoa?)
3. Hibiscus Tea: 


Practices:
1. Walking
2. Meditation Box Breathing 

Advice:
1. If you dont get enough deep sleep your bp will be higher than it needs to be
2. Less Sodium, caffeine which both spike bp.
3. Given sodium spikes your bp: Salty Popcorn and firehouse subs ... I dont know ... Its interesting that your body has been craving that sodium though ... hmm ...



## Investigate ##
2. Find what oat bran does and how fast it works.  Hmm it helps with Cholesterol ... 


# Peri-menopausal heavy periods #
Called peri-menopause the lead up to the moment of menopause is often accompanied by heavy bleeding and anaemia.  Its caused by an imbalance between estrogen and progesterone the interplay of the two makes the period happen properly.  Both increase the uterine lining but since sometimes in perimenopause an egg is not released (which is what triggers the progesterone) when the estrogen is still produced by the ovaries theres an imbalance.

Menopause is 12 consecutive months of no period.  Symptoms start up to 4 years before last period and end up to 4 years after.  Median age is 51.  5 percent experience menopause between 40-45. 


## Exacerbation ##
- Stress causes hormone changes which is the last thing you need.
- Caffeine and Refined Sugar may make heavy periods more likely.
- Conditions that affect the ovaries like Cancer or hysterectomy or smoking.
- Dehydration 
	- blood is only a portion of what comes out and water is required to replenish blood and tissue
	- decreased blood volume will increase blood thickness which contributes to the heaviness and longevity of the flow
	- also creates dehydration
- Magnesium promotes estrogen creation and therefore reduces estrogen dominance which is a common cause of heavy periods
- B6 supports the liver in processing excess hormones
- Insulin thickens the uterine lining (which means theres more to shed) therefore sugar should be avoided
- Iodine - much of it in the body is stored in the ovaries where iodine plays a key role in reducing estrogen dominance


## Helping ##
- Keep iron levels high.  take an iron tonic.  
- Vitamin C helps with iron absorption and helps capillaries to help bleeding
- Exercise 20min to keep energy high, and get better sleep,
- [Yoga for Menopause](https://www.healthline.com/health/yoga-for-menopause#1)
- [Box Breathing](https://www.healthline.com/health/box-breathing)
- Hydration (see dehydration above)
- [Backstrap Molasses](https://www.bloodandmilk.com/the-best-diy-remedies-to-manage-a-heavy-flow/) iron and also magnesium
- Placing a cold pack on abdomen causes constriction of blood vessels
- Avoid Sugar (since that stimulates insulin) 






## Doctor ##
- Visit a doctor if the bleeding lasts over 1 week
- A contraceptive pill might help with hormone regulation
- prescribed Hormone Therapy might influence hormones during the period
- The best reason to visit a doctor is to rule out the very serious: Endometriosis, Ademyosis, or Fybroids (little benign tumors) or cysts (noncancerous tissue).
- Is essure make heavy bleeding worse?

### Endometriosis ###
- Belly pain (and worse around period) (noc)
- Back pain or leg pain
- Pain during or after sex
- Pain on toilet
- Short Cycles less than 27 days (28c)
- Heavy periods lasting more than a week
- Started period before 11yo (12c)

Sometimes MRI can show, surgery required to be sure
Doesnt require treatment except to the degree that it causes problems

### Ademyosis ###
Risk factors:
- Started Period under 10yo
- Short Menstural cycles (less than 24 days)

Tenderness when you push on belly.  Often not found until hysterectomy
Doesnt require treatment except to the degree that it causes problems

## Inducing Menopause ##
- Ovarian ablation
- Shutdown of ovary funciton with HRT or radiation or tumor
- Surgical removal of the ovaries

# Detox #

## Heavy Metal Detox ##
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2szUwSYAKo&t=3s
Heavy Metals are shaken loose by PEMF

From the video:
Detox Phase 1
Convert heavy metals into water soluble elements in preparation for detox phase 2
Detox Phase 1.5 
Chelate and bind those metals so they can be disposed of properly and dont reattach to cells (take binders)
Detox Phase 2
Eliminate heavy metals through
kidney / urine or liver / stool / skin

If Herxheimer is too strong either slowing down phase 1, or increase phase 1.5 (theres no problem with sort of overdoing this part).  

https://www.sophianutrition.com/blogs/sophia-life-blog/are-you-detoxing-with-the-correct-binders

1. Magnetic Clay / Edible Clay
2. Zeolite / ACZ Spray
3. Modified Citrus Pectin
4. Chlorella
5. Activated Charcoal

Detoxing through the skin
1. Fine Infrared Sauna dome
2. Clay bath
3. Hyperthermia
4. Oil Pulling
5. Poultice
6. Exercise
7. Skin Brushing

Health Research 

- Alkalyzed Water
  - It should be noted that there is a significant difference between alkaline water, that which is made by chemical means which may be harmful to the body and ALKALYZED water which is made by passing an electrical current through the water thereby also creating a strong negative (-700 to -850) ORP (oxygen reduction principle). This negative ORP attracts the positivly charged free radicals in the body and starts breaking down the free radicals to the point where they the body is now able to flush them out naturally. This process is known as HOMEOSTASIS. It should also be pointed out that Alkalyzed water is also the most powerful antioxidant known to mankind. More pertinent information on ERW (electrolyzed reduced water) can be found by going to Google Scholar, which is a sub search engine of Google and typing in “Electrolyzed Reduced Water” or by visiting Pubmed.com and doing the same. Here you can find a great deal of information on what the Japanese have discovered to be the best kept secret the world has ever not known. My mom was working with this technology back in the early 60’s and had Russia not invaded our homeland (the Czech Republic, Czechoslovakia as known back then) which forced us to flee for obvious reasons, we would have been able to perfect this method of helping the body to heal itself with the assistance of alkalyzed water as it was having a staggeringly positive effect on her patients. Many hospitals throughout Asia, and Europe are utilizing this technology however it still remains relatively unknown in North America. Dor more information on this, please feel to contact me at tomsemail6646@gmail.com and I’ll do what I can to help. I hope this information was of value to you.

      - Same for yogurt
    - Added 1/2tbsp of lemon juice
      - Yogurt was 4.5 or maybe less
      - Cup was exactly the same

      - 6.75
    - Then I added another 1/8tsp baking soda
      - Still 6.75
    - Then a clean 2 shot glasses of water in yogurt and one drop of lemon
      - That’s more like 5.5
    - Then one drop of optimal ph into yogurt
  - Update: I’ve been doing this all wrong!
    - It says to dip it in then wait 15s and then read it
