# History #
My family bought a C128 in Bryan, TX at some point in 1987.  I know we had that for enough time for me to get used to playing it before we moved to Utah in fall of 1988.  
I had certain magazines in my collection for 10+ years and I read them all many times and some were notable.  The first one I can identify is the October 1988 issue of Commodore magazine which was right when we moved and thats when I was starting to learn BASIC on the computer from the manual and starting to really get into the computer.  I suspect my parents saw that I was getting interested and subscribed me to the magazine because of it.  Alternately I remember subscribing to magazines back then from publishers clearing house maybe they let me pick one?

I can trace back the moment we got the Amiga, or the moment I fell in love with it at Computerwise (this would have been after having read about it in commodore magazine for a few years) to the first Amiga World that I recognize: December 1991 so I suspect we started shopping that December and bought our Amiga in early 1992.  A conflicting piece of information: Lemmings was by all accounts brand new when we bought our Amiga and apparently it had come out in February of 1991.  When we bought it no one had heard of it and the computer store were clearly featuring it and it was really fresh and we paid full price.  A year is an eternity in computers so if it had been a year old when we bought it I don't think some of those things would have been true.  Amiga Format I remember the Nov 1991 vaugely and the Oct 1992 CU Amiga, but those were european mags so its possible that I just didnt get into computerwise that much until then.  My best guess is fall 1991.


# AMOS Pro #

# Preconfigured Environments #

* [AIAB](http://guide.abime.net/wbdist.htm)
* [AmigaSYS 4](https://www.amigasys.net/download.html) and here is [Version3 Setup](http://guide.abime.net/amigasys/chap1.htm)
* [ClassicWB](http://classicwb.abime.net/) and [How to install in UAE](http://classicwb.abime.net/classicweb/instructionsuae.htm)

### Classic WB ###
In the [installation instructions](http://classicwb.abime.net/classicweb/instructionsuae.htm) there was a missing step:
1. In step 3 in the paths tab I had to select 'WinUAE default(EXE directory' from a dropdown or it couldnt find my roms or my configurations.

IMHO now that its installed the ClassicWB is a bit unresponsive.  Maybe its just some setting or the configuration I chose.

Its got WHDLoad built in but I had to follow [these instructions](http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=38299) to install Amiga roms into the correct folder in the amiga devs directory so WHDLoad can find the right roms.  It asked for WB3.0 disk but I used a whole set of nearly but not exactly matching WB3.1 disks which was supposed to upgrade the entire system to WB3.1.  Maybe the disks I picked were just slightly incompatible or just the fact that its 3.1 slows it down?  Update: When I run the turbo configurations its more responsive.  The non cycle correct one doesnt play the games right but the cycle correct one seems to, but when I first launched it it asked me about mem management.  I think I selected RAD Boot and reboot, but I'm not sure because I didnt know what I was doing. I think it wanted to set something up but I dont think I did that right.

Holy crap the A4000 JIT Turbo configuration is LIGHTNING Fast.  Faster than windows it seems!  

# Using Classic WB Amiga Emulator #

The biggest problem with trying to run old computer software is they all assumed slightly different hardware configurations (whatever was relevant when they were released) which means if you just grab an old Amiga disk and found a way to put it into your PC you would have to figure out all of the processor and memory and rom combinations to use to get it to work and some games were very pick and refused to run if you dont get it right.  WHDLoad solves all of that and all of the games I have are WHDLoad packages.  

0. Unzip it anywhere you want.
1. Open winuae.exe and ignore all of the crap in there except ...
2. Click configurations (on the left)
3. Double Click 'A4000 Compatible (double speed but still compatible'
4. In the Amiga Desktop double click 'Software' on the left.
5. And Voila!  whatever you have installed is in there somewhere.

### Emulator Controls ##
1. F12 to select a different configuration
2. To get back to windows click the middle mouse button
2. If you can't quit the game the normal way then you can probably quit with either F10, or the End key, or the * on the numpad and if none of that works hit F12 and then click reset in the bottom left.  To save high scores you have to quit the normal way.
3. Its possible that the game will want to swap the mouse and joystick ports and you can do that in the WinUAE window (Host->GamePorts->Swap Ports button) but first you have to click the configuration you want and then click 'load' first.  Then dont hit save just hit start at the bottom.  You can't screw it up because theres a zip backup of the configurations in the configuration folder.
4. If you copied a folder and you think it should be there but its not showing up then right click ->redraw->update and then right click->show->all files
5. The help key is PgDn
6. The pause button on PC keyboard pauses the emulation entirely

### New Games ###
Pinball Fantasies is already in the emulator in the Software folder.

You actually install new games in windows before you start the Amiga.  Copy the WHDLoad folder to <wherever you have your emulator>/Hard Disk/Software/ and then it will be there in the Amiga when you start it up.

This isn't setup to run ADFs and I doubt they would work.  WHDLoad are way more compatible.

### Pinball Fantasies ###
Pinball Fantasies is already in the emulator in the Software folder.

* On the menu hit PgDn to switch to the second set of boards
* F1-F8 to start that many players
* For a screenshot hit print screen then you can paste it into mspaint and save it (or take a pic with your phone)

### Some warnings ###
Occasionally a game wont save correctly so its worth making sure that it does early on if its a long game and you want to sink your teeth into it.  

Some games save high scores and others dont.  Some save automatically and others dont.  Some games expect you to hit strange keys and you might have to look up winuae keyboard mapping.  

I use A4000 turbo most of the time but if the game doesnt run or crashes or has graphical glitches or the music plays too fast or the sprites are moving too fast or something then switch back to 'A4000 Compatible'.

### Disadvantages of WHDLoad ###
WinUAE Save States don't work.  Thats the only thing I can think of.


# WinUAE #
1. Cool joystick mapping to xbox or PS4 controllers - I think you can remap up to a jump button.
2. the pause key on a PC keyboard pauses the emulation in its entirety so it is a whole Amiga pause.  If you can't find a pause in your game just stab that.  I wonder if you could map the pause key to a button on the joystick ... hmm ...



# Amiga OS 4 #
I just bought it from Hyperion Entertainment. I bought "AmigaOS4.1FinalEdition for Classic" whatever all that means.  I hope it was the right choice for WinUAE *crosses fingers*

I'm thinking it was right but boy is installing this complicated.

## Installation Instructions ##
* [Option 1 - mritter0 on EAB](http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=75264)
* [Option 2 - Thomas Rapp](https://thomas-rapp.homepage.t-online.de/os41uae/index.html)
* [Option 3 - Youtube video with all text in another language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJo4sZeQ8D0)
* [Option 4 - Amigax1000 blog post](http://amigax1000.blogspot.com/2014/08/amigaos41-classic-on-winuae-part-1.html)


I started with Option 1 but I'm making progress by using hints from all three. The biggest thing I had to change was the hardcoded locations of all of the roms in the config file he provided.  I thought rescan would upate them but no you have to do that yourself.  rom for OS and for ppc.  Upon review of the instructions it says to do that changing of the paths . One thing the youtube video did is use slirp networking which is not located in the same place it is in the video: Expansions->ExpansionBoardSettings->NetworkAdapters from there its similar.  

Ok I've got it fully installed now!  I'm having a bit of a problem though: it wont read my cd image anymore.  It will if it is started up with that image but otherwise ... UPDATE: Well it works now.  I just startup without it there, and then when I hit f12 and put it there it works!

that took ... about 3 hours

## Transferring files ##
One thing thats real weird is that there are no directories allowed in WinUAE using OS4.  It kind of blows my mind.  I've spent the last hour trying every configuration option to get it to work and it wont and when I look online it says that its impossible and to use FTP instead.  Thats mildly unacceptable.  Whats even weirder is if you add a directory to the list in WinUAE everything seems fine but the machine wont boot and there are apparent kickstart compatibility errors. And even after you remove it sometimes it still doesnt want to boot.

Options:
1. FTP (Amiga FTPMount lets you mount directories)(AmiFTP
2. Use a 3.1 winuae to mount a shared hardfile and do a two step copy.
3. burn an iso
4. abuse adfs
5. [amiga explorer](http://www.amigaforever.com/ae/) from AmigaForever (see [this thread](http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=77448) to get that working but it seems like it lets you get to all of your amiga disks from windows explorer)
6. NFS rumored unsupported maybe?

I ended up using something called smallftpd in windows to setup a quick server in the folder I want to transfer from and I can start it up and take it down easily and it only serves up that folder.  To do this I had to use AmiFTP on the amiga side and connect to my windows local address (ipconfig)  Wow it seems to timeout pretty quick.  Ok I fixed that in the users setting in smallftpd.  I had to create a simple user in smallftpd.  None of it was terribly difficult and I didnt get too hung up on any of it, but wait I'm connected but not seeing files.  Ahh in AmiFTP there was an error "500 command not understood" and I thought that was suspicious.  There was a setting for unix or dos and I had set it to dos (since I am connecting to windows) but it wanted the unix setting.  OMG its so slow.  a 20MB file took like 25 seconds.  And now I'm confused because I unarc'd it to the ram disk and copying that to the work hard drive seems to have locked up the machine :( and now since I thought I was being clever I've got to re-download it (ram disk) and wait!  after reboot amiftp doesnt have my connection settings anymore!?!  (found out that when you close it you can choose to save your settings so maybe that worked)  Ok now second time through and it downloaded it apparently (same slow speed) but now I dont know where it put it locally on the amiga.  Its not in work where I told it to go, or in ram disk (where it was previously set to download to).  Update: it is actually in Work: but when I open it in the file browser it doesnt show up.  Oh right I have to show all files if it doesnt have a .info.  

It is saying transfer speed is about 10000 cps which I presume is characters per second aka bytes per second and if so thats 10Kps.  yeah looking at the filesizes that seems right.   A 600k file is taking about a minute to transfer.  omg that means this 6MB folder is going to take 10 minutes!?!  Well I guess this really is like things were bitd.  I guess those are pretty typical modem speeds for when I used to download fish disks from finland.  I'll go do something else.

Update: When I downloaded just one zipped file it ran blazing at like 800-1000Kps.  Thats more like it. 

## Autocompletion ##
Wow you know what doesn't work so well?  Autocomplete.  Its not quite intelligent enough to do the things correctly so it seems to complete files before directories even if you are trying to cd.  Thats a little bit primative and they could do better imho.  

## Running 68k software on OS4.1 ##
Well I tried AMOSPro by dragging it on RunInUAE and it started up reasonbly quick.  Theres a pretty big problem though because the text is so slurred by some antialiasing or something its unreadable and not workable.  TBH the OS4.1 desktop isn't clear at all to my eyes so I wonder if I've got some setting entirely wrong.  A bigger problem is I couldn't switch back to OS4.1 when I was done because it hadn't merely brought up a window or another screen but a whole instance of apparently FSUAE which probably uses the F12 key to get out of it?  Not sure.  Ok I looked it up ctrlaltQ might quit.  I'll try it.  Yeah that worked great.  

Ok even more interesting is when I just clicked on AMOSPro without starting runuae it ran and it looked sharp (although the window was super small).  When I got out of it the screen is pretty glitched.





## Experiment with VICE C64 emulator on AmigaOS4 ##
Once I got it transferred, uninstalled, and all its a pretty good experience (Update: no it seems to be that way but it sucks but there are parts that are good).  Everything you need to control is done from the right click context menu and its pretty full featured.  This is version 3.1 for PPC AmigaOS4.x.  I'm trying to get the simple assembler program that 8Bit Show and Tell shows in [This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUCSZw7piKE&list=PLvW2ZMbxgP9z9Un4LXivII_D1Hh5gZ7r9) 
### So Slow ###
Update: Input into the C64 emulator just got super slow.  Like virtually untypeable.  I'm going to try to proceed for the moment.  Update: I changed the screen size so its tiny (1x1 pixels) and now the typing is faster. Update: that was a false positive.  After I reset its pretty fast but then run any command and it starts to crawl.  It reports that it is running at 100% speed but its running far slower than the video I'm watching.  I'm not yet able to load the assembler.  

### Keys ###
Ok theres a problem here with keys.  I'm on a PC Keyboard which has a map to the Amiga Keyboard which has a map to the C64 keyboard, so its going to be tough to find all of the correct keys, however when I wasn't able to type the quotation mark I asked my 10year old self what to do and from literally 30 years ago I remembered that Load Shift 2 Shift 4 Shift 2 ,8,1 was the magic keystrokes *pride*.  


### Listing the d64 ###
Now a really weird thing is that didnt work with this disk.  I dont know whats going on but I cant get an actual directory listing.  I was trying to attempt this with a different d64 but I got distracted and opened the 'vice monitor' and now I cant close it or use the emulator.  Ok I restarted the amiga and loaded a different disk and the command load "$",8 and then list showed me the directory.

### Running the assembler ###
Ok a few tries and resets later and 5 min loading time and it says ready and with this assembler it doesnt hold your hand  at all.  Hey I did it!!! Its running!  The cursor is blinking super slow and every character I type has to be held down before it registers but it is running!

## Cartridges ##
Wow this emulator actually has the super snapshot cartridge among many more!  I guess you have to give it the rom file or a memory file or something but its really cool that it has those options.  


# Assembly on Amiga #
The amospro archive on github has a copy of the devpac compiler in it which you run by typing genam

# GNU Toolchain on Amiga #
Some of it is in this [Amiga Development Tools](https://github.com/sba1/adtools/) on github which should provide enough of a cross compiler environment to build amiga stuff on PC.  This [simplegit Amiga git client](https://github.com/sba1/simplegit) is where I heard of it.

# Games I wanted to play because they call to me now #

I started this project on somewhat of a whim started on Sep 21 2019 and was done on Dec 27 2019. I ended up firing up even if only for a few minutes how many games???  716!  only a few didn't work.  I'd say 10-15.  I sorted them in to several folders:  Keepers and Maybe play again in a number of sorting categories:  "Actually wanted to own bitd" " Always curious about bitd" "Always wanted to beat bitd" " Always wanted to play or try bitd" "Games that look interesting now" "only keeping because owned or legendary" " owned and always wanted to beat bitd" "owned and loved or confessions of an amiga addict" and "Played a bit and wanted to beat bitd"


* Cabal - it was ok. I couldnt get off of the first screen in three games but I bet if I tried many times I could eventually.  The controls werent nearly as bad as I thought they would be but it would be amazing in VR.  3/10
* Cabaret Asteroids - Fantastic!  This is one of the best asteroids Ive ever played.  Spheres of Chaotica comes to mind as another competitor but of course totally different.  This must have been programmed in pure 68000 assembly because it is so damn smooth and the pixels are so crisp it seems arcade perfect.  I think its a little unfair when it starts because sometimes they are right on top of you but otherwise this is a masterpiece of asteroids!  High Score 9480  I encountered a situation where one of the asteroids was outside the screen boundary. I dont know if thats a display problem in my emulator or what.  I don't know if someone can make something so vicerally responsive and smooth with todays layered hardware.  This is just incredible.  Oh and it saves your high scores!!! 10/10
* Captive - Cool intro / loading screen for sure with the pixel lines falling from the ceiling and bouncing on each other.  long load time.  Oh ok I just had to click and it would have continued.  Cool UI too where the whole game is played in a suitcase!  Really cool how you proceed to planets too.  Wow its really cool and it works well.  Its also totally unforgiving.  Dont step in water at all.  It doesn't show you where to go or anything so it feels kind of like starglider 2 but boy is it cool though.  Apparently written by one dude!?!  I read that this is one of the best dungeon master clones - made by one person - totally worth the time.  Heres a [website dedictated to the game](http://captive.atari.org/) which even goes as deep as explaining the disassembled map generation code!
* Centrefold Squares - Pretty good reversi clone with sexy motivation to improve and win!  Its not easy on the lower levels so it probably gets pretty hard later on.  I like this challenge and want to play this more. 
* Aladdin - AGA The title music is great even with some vocals! There are some cheats built into the WHDLoad. Animation and graphics are great!  It even supports two button controller (at least with the WHDLoad it does) which is a big deal for a game like this.  Wow its just wonderful!  Especially with the cheats: You can continue from checkpoints with unlimited lives.  That makes this game totally beatable and fair!  Without the cheats I would have wanted to love but ultimately hated this if I had bought it back then.  Beat level 1 in about 10 minutes and level 2 in about the same.  Its still got to use the spacebar to swtich between sword and apple tossing which is ... annoying and I had to lookup on a longplay to realize i could even throw apples. I just beat a couple cool bosses on level 3 I just got cast into the sultans dungeon (which is the title of the level) so now I'm on level 4.  I could play this again (9/21/19)
* Ballistix - Psyclapse and Reflections made some other game or games I know.   The intro text is fantastic!  Its interesting and would probably be some fun for 2 players.  Its kind of like crossfire honestly!  The physics are a bit frustrating but Im sure I would get used to it.  I played 3 games and won one and it was pretty cool kind of like pinball and crossfire put together.  Looks like there are like 50 levels! (9/21/19)
* Banshee - Some mag says this is of the top 50 Amiga games of all time.  Lets find out!  I've never played this before and have only heard of it in the last few years.  Cheats:  FLEV17 unlimited lives and F1-F10 level select.  Wow amazing intro with static cutscenes and great images.  Looks like Chaos Engine graphics (Bitmap Bros???).  Its got tongue in cheek writing but its really cool.  Nope not bitmaps.  Allows 2 button joystick (YAY!)  Hotseat coop in this game.  W pauses.  Esc Quits. Return does some flippydo.  "Objective: Enter Styx City and destroy giant guardians".  I got to level 2 and WOW This game is great.  I love it so much.  The art is so fantastic and the shooting and explosions are perfection. (9/21/19)
* Body Blows - One button fighting.  I had this for DOS back in the day and I remember it more fondly than I do now.  I think I had a move list on a stand up cardboard triangle that came in the box.  I remember being able to make some progress and sometimes beat some of my opponents in the dos version.  The graphics are interestingly amateur, meaning they're not but sometimes they seem like they are.  The animations are not fluid but thats not a problem at all.  The moveset is the only problem.  The ECS Version has a certain charm that the AGA doesn't even if the AGA looks better.  The backgrounds on AGA are STUNNING.  I've got it on difficulty 0 and its impossible for me to get a hit in on AGA.  Id like to beat at least one match on ECS.  Lets see if I can do it.  Nope.  I give up.  I bet if someone sat with me for 5 minutes and showed me how to play I could beat an easy level but for now no. (9/21/19)  
* Alien 3 - I remember really loving a coverdisk demo of this game back in the day.  Lets see how it holds up.  Ok good news: It recognizes 2 button joystick.  And has an easy difficulty and has up to 9 lives.  I know what I liked about this game.  It is achievable in time.  The levels are large but not sprawling mazes like metroid so while  you certianly dont know your way around it at first it doesn't take too long to figure it out.  I like the scary enemies although they jump up a bit too close for you to react.  Having not much ammo makes it intense although I think it would be a more fun game with unlimited ammo and would still be intense.  The shooting is pretty good although the jumping sucks and theres not enough time to react to the enemies crawling out of the ground.  YAY After about 15 min I beat the first level! I didn't even try the second level. Easiest mode and on 3 tries out of 9 but I'm really proud of myself and if there were a ton more levels at just about that level of difficulty I would really enjoy this (or would have in the 90s).  Also if I could pick up where I left off day to day ... but this seems like the kind of game that didn't have a save or a password system unfortunately.  So ultimately I like that you climb up and down and crawl around an unfamiliar 'dungeon' basically to free prizoners and shoot the bad guys while you are at it.(9/21/19)
* Another World - Geez the graphics and presentation on this game are fucking amazing.  for that time the 3d blows the mind and its so much like a movie!.  Theres even blurriness effects!?!   There are level select codes but would I have had access to those back then?  Wow the 15th anniversary edition has more checkpoints with passwords!  I remember the demo having the first level on it and I remember having a really hard time beating that but I think I got to the jail one time.  I even remember it being scary when he got blown up in the lab.  and YES!!! Even the Amiga version has PASSWORDS when you die!!! Thats such a relief.  That means this is a great game with an actual decent overall difficulty.  Interesting side effect of this game with this emulator if you accidentally hit the second button you will be thrust into the enter password screen.  Usually you're supposed to press C when you die or something.  This is a real winner!
* Bart vs the World - The WHDLoad has a 2 button gamepad option!!!  it has cool music for sure!  Its got good dialogue becxause I can hear the words in the characters voices!  OMG The second button doesn't work at all, worse it kicks you entirely out of the game!!!  Ok with the trainer on I got through China and it was slightly fun.  I enjoyed it for sure but I know that without the trainer I would have been so disheartened in the 90s.  I wouldn't have been able to get anywhere and would have given up but would have felt like I should keep trying to get better at it every day even though it wasnt fun to get my ass kicked over and over.  Its a good version though. Control is the same as NES.  The collision detection is much better than I remember the nintendos being (esp on the china wall level which I got to just a few times on the NES) and the graphics are really great in comparison.  The music is ok not memorable but nice but also not simpsons themed.  (9/21/19)
* Bart vs the Space Mutants - I'm playing the 2 disk version which has a great cinematic intro actually!  I remember the graphics being way wors on NES.  OH WOW it even has wow man bart voices!!!  this intro is so cool!!!  And simpsons music clip!  "I'm bart simpson who the hell are you?"  That was apparently the whole first disk.  its sucha  funny premise that it wants purple objects so you have to spray them so the aliens wont take over.  I remember totally buying it in the context of being so excited to play a simpsons game when it first cam eout on NES.  Graphics here are way better.  Geez the controls are terrible.  They're slightly better than NES imho.  The music is way better.  Its just so strangely crappy though.  I got probably 1/2 through painting the objects on the first level.  I probably only got slightly farther on the NES back in the day.  What a wasted weekend rental that game was.  :S  Even so I can't not have fond memories of those few minutes of this game.  It was fun playing them again. (9/21/19)
* Battle Squadron - This one is new to me. I only heard about it a few weeks ago as a sequel to Hybris (which I had also never really played but had heard of many times even in the Amiga Addict magazine article).  It has a really funny intro speech sample "Welcome to battle squadron" which sounds like "womo no bosodon".  Hey its got good music and a cool story and opening cutscenes. Wow this is great!  the shooting is good the graphics are great. Even if it doesn't have high resolution or parallax its AGA and really uses the colors well.  Its so colorful!  The music and sound is awesome (both at once) and I had fun.  I think I got through the first level (it said enter here or something) and didnt beat that inside part.  Some of the graphics were mind blowing like the invisible enemies which were just a little shimmer on the background.  That was great!  The high score music is sombre but AWESOME!  In that interior portion there were these one powerful enemies that kept shooting and moving across the screen and Ig uess you have to kill them or they kill you which I dont think I like in a game like this and they took lots of hits and you couldn't hit them from the center you had to get real delicate move in right next to their bullets which was near impossible for me.  Still this was very good.  7/10.  I don't know if there are any cheats but it would be fun to cheat through this to see all of the cool content they made or to get really good at it (too many games) or at least good enough I could beat it.  This is a keeper.  (9/21/19)
* Addams Family - good news there is a password system in this game. Cheats - Help toggle infinite lives Del toggle infinite energy.  Running it in Turbo mode doesnt seem to work correctly with colors, but running cycle correct does seem to work.  its pretty fun! This version I think is one of the best and I have watched part of a walkthrough so I knew some of the secrets.  It also gave some clues.  I dont know how to get a password for where I left off but its good that there is a password system (assuming that it hopefully let you have more lives when you password continued!?!).  THe music and graphics are pretty great.  The whole idea of 5 lives and 2 hits per life is absurd, but maybe you can collect more hearts or something?  That would help.  I have a sneaking suspicion that the only way to get more hearts is to put in the right cheat password (which there are a lot).  This could be fun with cheats and might have been decent fun without back in the day.  (9/22/19)
* Crazy Cars III - I had always heard about this series and wanted to play it.  Awesome mirrored building intro cutscene art.  Titus. It uses a joystick pointer not the mouse!?!  not a big deal just unnecessarily awkward.  Cool music!  ok this is really good.  You select the city you want to race in (and the level of the opponents) and then you bet before the race (confusing but so clever) which adds a lot of intensity to the race since you have to come in first to get the most money and you could lose a lot.  Then you have great racing with not too cheap rivals (at least on this level) who have great rubberbanding to make it not too difficult and the collision is excellent and doesnt punish you too much when you hit something.  The graphics are great pixel art and totally workable if not very interesting except the main car which looks really great (ferrari?). oh wow and theres lots of car customization options too.  Theres even a training mode.  I beat the first race in first place but it was so tight and so intense and much fun, so if I'm looking for a racing game from back then I could spend some time with this.  I'm not in the mood right now to invest any more time in it though :)  8/10 (9/22/19)
* Bubba n Stix - I had always heard about this game and wanted to play it.  Presentation is classy and fun. Core design.  Good news there is a code/password system and 2 button joystick support built in!  SFX or Music not both :S  The animation fluidity is pretty incredible.  Without SFX you dont know when you're getting hit.  The cartoony graphics remind me of the simpsons in some ways.  Great graphics.  I cant relate to the main character or figure out how to do literally anytyhing in the game.  I cant kill enemies or jump on anything or anyone.  Ok I finally figured out how to kill but Ive explored everything and cant figure out what to do.  Its not fun for me atm but I'm glad I got to fiddle with it.  Now I'm trying the CD32 version.  Theres no intro cutscene sounds the cutscene is pretty incredible (though not pre-rendered which is better imho though often harder too for devs)  HEre you can do music and sfx (if the sound starts to work)  SFX are working but music doesnt work in this WHDLoad package.  THe graphics are identical I think (so still good).  The buttons dont seem to work the same!?! Yeah I went back and confirmed the graphics are identical but the buttons dont work the same.  They seem to work better on the A1200 version, maybe the CD32 version is expecting the 4 button controller and I dont have it configured that way?  Thats probably it.  4/10  (9/22/19)
* 4th & Inches - I was always led to believe this is the football game to play!  All of the magazines and advertisements talked this game up but I never got to play it.  To be honest I wouldn't really have liked any football game back then but I felt compelled to play this since it looked so cool.  Just from the intro it reminds me of tecmo bowl but with bigger sprites and it doesnt scroll as well (which means you cant see as much of the field).  Ugh.  If I was really into football in like 1988 and had a good imagination and was motivated enough to take the time to learn the complicated UI and controls, then I can see why this would have been great for those people.  For today: 2/10
* Beyond Dark Castle - I always wanted to own this back in the day because my friends showed me and said it was awesome.  Looking at reviews online (including AVGN) I don't think I'm going to like this at all but lets find out.  90 seconds later and I'm done. I couldn't even figure out how to enter the rooms.  Every step was a chore.  Aiming was with the mouse and movement with the keys and while that can work in some cases, geez not this way.  (9/22/19)
* Civilization - Wow the intro is fantastic!  This really drew you into the game world and made it a place you could spend a long time in.  I'm impressed!  It asked if you wanted to play with M+K or just K and wow this would be a nightmare with just k imho.  I didnt realize that it had a pretty big cast of developers even back then.  Wow if you click on Earth it shows you an amazing creation story cutscene with pictures and text and exciting music!  Everytime something cool happens you get a cool cutscene.  City founded, babylon founded, Babylonia wise men discover the secret of bronze working!  etc.  It wouldn't be so bad with keys now that I'm into it.  Uh oh.  Mongols took my capital city (and only city) (with no settlers).  I'm screwed!  "Centuries later archaeologists discover the remains of an ancient civilization! ... They discover a stone tablet which contains but one mysterious phrase: Hammurabi will return!"  well played!  It kicked me out of the game and that seems like a perfect place to stop.  Lets just go take a peek into the AGA version.  It has nice shimmering effects on the title screen.  The intro animation doesnt look too different but there is some subtle palette animation and real animation.  so its not so static.  Those extra colors did go a long way to making some of the intro graphcis clearer especially on the dinosaur earth screen.  The leader profile graphics are way better.  The tutorial in both is pretty good especially for its time.  Without that the polish on this game would have been so low no one would have been able to figure it out and it would have been much more obscure.  The AGA graphics on the overworld aren't that diffferent but they are clearer and slightly animated rivers and stuff and that is a nice improvement.  I dont perceive that the resolution is any different though.  One thing thats weird is the clicking of the menus is not so discrete this time and its hard to open the menus just right. It slike the hit box is too small.
* Chips challenge - Got to lesson 4 YMCJ - I always had fond feelings of this after hearing about it in mags and playing it on Dust's Atari Lynx (Which was realted to the Amiga in some ways).  the music isn't great and a bit hard on my ears.  The graphics are notably low resolution (text especially) but thats ok.  The puzzles are pretty good but one of them on level 4 you get most of the way through and you find out from trial and error that you picked the wrong block and die and have to start over.  Thats not entirely fair imho.  Otherwise theyre pretty fair and fun.  This isn't special enough for me to keep around or play again and while I don't think I woudl have bought this as a kid, since it has a password system and is reasonably fair I would have been ok with it and would not have felt ripped off. (9/22/19)
* Blasteroids - Tengen - The pixel art is interesting, not bad, a bit cartoony and pretty unclear.  I think they must have taken the arcade pixel art and just imported it directly into this lower resolution and low color display.  apparently this is 2p simultaneous?  Its cool that you can select sectors to go to and even go back to previously visited sectors.  The shooting is pretty good and satisfying (if cartoony) the sound is grating, and the music is weird but ok.  its cool that you can get upgrades.  I got to the boss of the first world and got an 86k High score!  Its got credits like its an arcade game which is ok but means I ran out but there is a cheat in the WHDLoad to have unlimited credits.  I think I would have liked this as a kid honestly. its asteroids with some depth!
* Barbarian 2 - Palace - The skeleton saying follow me is pretty cool presentation!  Holy cow even in game the warrior princess is scantily clad!  The graphics aren't detailed but they work ok.  The skeleton saying insert disk 2 is also pretty awesome!  Alright! Once I figured out that i had to push like down and attack to change directions I was ok.  At first I just got my ass kicked moving in the opposite direction to where I wanted to go!  I quit after just getting kicked by a cyclops troll 1000 times in a row without having a chance to get up at all.  Probably the 3rd enemy.  I know some people (I think pugman maybe) can beat this without too much trouble, but boy I sucked.  You know what it might be kind of fun to get better at this though.   (9/22/19)
* Barbarian - Psygnosis - omg this is kind of terrible (at first glance).  The opening screens look cool (one is funny imho), but then you get to playing it and the control is choppy and unpredictable.  You know what, I only partially give them credit for that.  I think if the Amiga had done one thing different it would have been twice as successful: a two button joystick or gamepad standard with every amiga.  Now if it had four buttons that would have been amazing because then every function of the controls of this game could have been easily mapped to a button and there wouldn't have to be this awkward mouse or keyboard presses button which eventually responds with action.  Still since the game is designed that way (even if its in part to get around the lack of buttons) and it makes it work except there is a dramatic delay between the time you press a button and the time it does anything at all.  its impossible to tell when youve pressed the button and until you know what hes supposed to do it just seems like hes throwing himself randomly into spikes and enemies.  The level design though: cheap by design.  The first enemies you encounter are invisible spikes that don't have any indication that they are there and kill you instantly.  I might actually have the patience to try over and over to beat each screen but you only get 3 lives (which I think is pretty absurd for most home games).  Oh wow On my third continue I slew one enemy!  Thats a pretty big deal here.  Ok you have to know that spacebar switches to another menu of commands and then hit the hidden UP arrow to lean down and pick up the items.  I get it that from the perspective of the item you are picking it UP but from the perspective of the player you are crouching down.  Ok I got to a werewolf and it said I had completed 5% when I died.  Thats enough for me!!! (9/22/19)
* Barbarian 2 Psychnosis -  The intro graphics are awesome!  the ripped old dude has some weird chest for sure.  Ok this is totally different than the previous barbarian game.  This isn't menu based at least. The combat is punching and is ok.  You have to move forward and backward through the woods on paths.  Its kind of fun to search through the woods for stuff.  The combat isnt so bad in this game although the controls are pretty wooden.  I got to a cave entrance after lots of battles.  One thing real weird is pressing the button doesnt attack it does a dance move or something worthless.  but pressing down and attack then swings the weapon.  You have to be super precise to hit the enemies.  This was back in the day when they thought games had to be hard to be good and they broke lots of unwritten rules to make them hard.  I got to the bottom of the cave and to a door and probably should have pressed a key like space but i pushed up (as you do) and it 'jumped' but really it just hit the ceiling and he fell over hurt, well there were some red slimes chasing me and then they devoured me.  I went down some stairs but they were an invisible dead end and I couldnt get back up them wihtout stepping into the slimes.  I finished two percent of thegors quest. (9/22/19)
* The Black Crypt - I like the presentation instantly.  On the intro screen and in the game graphics they have embraced the limitations of the graphics and made the text textured with a subtle shimmer but still incredibly clear to read. The icons on the right are really well defined and clear and still colorful. Everything in the game is clear even if that means its stylized and not realistic.  I think I prefer for artists to do the best with what they have but not overreach.  I also like that everything has shadows.    I think it might have been fun to mess with the character creation but I was able to skip it and i'm ok with that because I want to see what the game is really like.  I think it is pretty cool how they did games like this (and Dungeon Master, and Eye of the Beholder, and Captive).  Its pretty damn immersive honestly.  I died real quick when I went down some stairs and opened a door and encountered a big troll.  I dont even think I got a hit on him.  I think this is a really cool game that I would have been intimidated by when I was a kid but I can see why people liked these games.  Note: This didnt seem to support numeric keypad controls which is kind of a tragedy. (9/22/19)
* Bad Dudes! Data East.  I always wanted to play and love this game back in the day.  I played it a bit on NES at some point and could tell it wasn't great, but something about it was really my style.  Maybe the lingo, or the city, or maybe I could identify, or maybe I like fighting ninjas, I dont know.  Hey I think the intro graphics are pretty great.  The text is clear to read and the dudes look awesome!  President "Ronnie" haha!  The guy on that screen has a super fast motor mouth its funny!  Its kind of terrible.  Well the graphics are decent but they look like Sega Master System could do this (though bigger sprites than sega usually had).  The combat doesnt make much sense to me and its impossible to fight without getting hit which I think is kind of a cardinal sin that they break in games like this. I somehow beat the first level and boss and regardless of all of htis its still fun because when you do pull off a punch or kick and the enemy dies with one hit thats pretty damn satisfying.  I died quick on the train level.  The high score entry is EPIC with the character as the pointer. I love that so much!!! (9/22/19)
* Champions of Krynn - SSI - The text isn't so easy to read because its so stylized.  The graphics look like they were ported from EGA or something. Wow its got a demo on the main menu which is like for store shop windows or something!  it describes the plot and your goal and walks through towns and dungeons and shows combat and has like back of box descriptions and shows a dragon!  The character creation even lets you customize your players icon colors!  I created a character.  Please let it be there when I reload the game ... YES it worked!  The presentation and title screen and menus make me feel like I would be comfortable spending a very long time immersed in this game world and software.  I like that it could be entirely keyboard controlled.  Thats important to me and to a smooth gameplay experience.  Ok it took me a while but I figured out buying and trading and equipping weapons and money and I figured out learning spells and camping and resting to memorize them.  Then I moved a bit and got into a battle.  Lets see what this is like!  Well I didn't really figure it out and I killed no one and died quickly.  Probably because of the auto selection that I did (which didn't do what I expected).  At least I can see why that could be interesting battles.  I didn't like that you couldn't see where the enemies are. (9/22/19)
* Cubulus - WOW!  What a great puzzle game!  Lots of old puzzle games don't have much longevity (either due to shallowness or due to them getting too hard too quick) and I can't speak for this one any more than the others, but the first level was a really fun rubikscube like puzzle that I was able to beat in just a few minutes and I'm proud of myself so theres satisfaction in beating it.  The music is fantastic!  Interesting rocking and not repetitive.  This is by Tobias Richter whose name I knew (but from what I didn't ) but it was from his star trek game on the Amiga which I knew something about back in the day and read about and even think I played a few times but never got anywhere at all whatsoever at all.  Now I'm trying Level 14.  The timer is classy because it looks like its dripping! Also wow it doesnt killl you if you dont meet the time limit!  you just get downgraded on your rating!  You can pause it and the screen blanks at any time.  Thats nice too.  Well Level 14 was too much for me. it shows you how many moves ive done: 162.  ANyway its been 10 minutes on this one and I don't think I'll beat it anytime soom.  its getting too complex for me to think through becaue every change makes changes somewhere else and I sort of fundamentally hate stuff like that.  Great game for what it is though! (9/22/19)
* Cyberball - I remember wanting to play this back in the day even though I didnt like football much and wasnt good at sports games (though I didn't admit that to myself until much later) but I thought it was a rip off of speedball or speedball 2.  Its not at all, theres only a passing similarity of the setting.  This is football with a great interface and decent enough gameplay.  Although I wouldn't say the graphics are 'good' they totally work and I like them.  the UI is clear and I think it animates really cool, and the way you select plays and other options I think works really well (8 directions you point at what you want with the joystick).  I like that turnovers happen when the ball explodes :)  I quit after one period with no score and no real successful plays on either side.  Cool game. (9/22/19)
* California Games - I had this on C64 and remember so much loving the intro screen music because it is louie louie and I still do.  The license plate on the front screen looks awesome.  Its got 6 events.  Lets see if I can do any of them at all!?!  Well in foot bag I did bounce it twice before dropping it several times!  I kind of like it.  The collision here is pixel perfect and precise and so much better than the collision on the C64.  My second time I got 9 in a row and hit the bird too. I think its a fun little mini game that people could have fun getting better and better at as friends.  The animation in the skating is pretty great.  It looks painful when they fall.  I can feel the scrapes and dont want to be that skater who tripped (on a tuft of grass).  You know I'm pretty sure theres a bikini on the sidewalk which is one of the obstacles.  I successfully jumped a curb and dodged a bunch of stuff.  It all loads pretty fast.  If you know what you're getting into here I don't have any complaints about this game. This game and those like it by EPYX ruled the magazines back in the day.  This was the mario party of the day and is totally 80s!  The animation on the surfing is pretty awesome if you ask me.  he dives in sometimes when he loses his board.  I think they really took some time to develop this port.  I remember the skating half pipe pretty well and remember feeling like I could skate because I did so well at it on the C64!  I'm sure I was absolutely terrible.  This time I didn't do any better and didnt pull off any tricks.  I just got faster enough to get a bit of air.  Hey I like the flying disk a lot!  I caught it once!!!  In fact the next round I did it 3 times in a row!  This is a lot of fun!  Something about the Amiga version of all of these games seems less clumsy than the C64 ever did.  FUN!  I don't feel like playing them again but I'm glad I did.  (9/22/19)
* Cytron - Psygnosis - Really cool title music!  Matt Furniss?  I've heard of him.  Also cool opening cinematic!  Oh holy cow I LOVE this so far!  Its like a kick ass futuristic gauntlet game!  With locks and doors and shit.  WOW this is awesome.  I loved playing the first level.  I didn't know what to expect and have never played this before so this was a great surprise.  I absolutely love the smoothness of the movement controls in this game.  Its fast and slick, but not too slick and not too floaty.  The shooting is awesome too!  If it were a dual stick shooter I would be in heaven but its the Amiga so I can't expect too much (Llamatron!) its so great as it is and my dual stick thought takes nothing away from this!  and then WHOA theres some kind of Blaster Master style transformation into a smaller tank to get through tight spots!  What fun!  The pixel perfect collision on this game is pretty impressive.  It so fun!  I made it to the 3rd level!  The second was a cool maze with lots of teleportals.  Great High Score screen too.  Cool blitter effect and great rock song! (9/22/19)
* Apidya Kaiko (Number 2?) - Kaiko?  Cool Animated cinematic with characters and a castle and spooky music!  Wow its pretty heavily anime righ there.  He turns into a bug to go get an antidote to save his girl.  Great into tunes!  Its impressive how it tells the whole story really well. It really gets you into the game.  There are a lot of options.  2 button pad options, difficulty, number of lives, simulated or simultaneous teammate?  wow!  I'm so proud!! I died once but I dodged so many little beasties and beat scene 1 now!  "You survived Scene 1!"  I never played this as a kid but always wanted to and I know I played it as a young adult, but then I thought it was dumb.  I didnt see this games opening cinematic or know what was going on so I wasnt drawn in at all, and being so out of the picture even though I knew that lots of other people liked it, I wasn't engaged in a bug battle.  Now I love it!  ok now I died many times in a row on stage 2 and I've got an impression.  It lost a lot of the fun for me as soon as I got hit once because then the weapon I had was so puny everything was 4 times harder to kill which made it way less fun.  A little harder to kill I would understand but theres a huge gap.  I can continue but I only get 3 credits so I'm not impressed with the life and continue structure but the music is great and the shooting is great (when you've got even a little bit of power).  At least its two player hot seat.
* Apidya Audios - Looks exactly the same as Kaiko!?!  I tried simultaneous 2p mode.  When one player dies you both have to continue!?!  Well I'm pretty much done with this. (9/22/19)
* Better Dead than Alien - Confessions of an Amiga Addict!  Also I had an old Commodore magazine with this featured in it.  Ive wanted to really play this since back then but only got to play it emulated as a young adult but the cover art has always stuck in my head as awesome.  Its great that its two player hot seat!  when one player dies the other doesn't!  Thats a breath of fresh air.  I like the graphics and the bosses, but maybe I'm picky or maybe I am getting used to modern graphics but pixel games are looking kind of worse these days.  I'm having a harder time differentiating between 8 and 16 bit pixel graphics.  I think 20 years ago I would have been able to tell instantly but now I have to think a bit and use my noggin.  The sprites in this are just fine but they aren't all that clear what they are except that they are aliens of some weird variety.  Oh I'm just being picky.  Its fun shooting! You don't die instanly on a hit and there are even bosses!  You aren't just stuck to the bottom of the screen in this game and the enemies have subtly interesting patterns where they like move faster at the last second.  Its a lot of fun!  I got to Drambuie (level 2?) past the asteroid field.  I can sort of play two players at once with mouse and joystick but boy it gets confusing.  One nice subtle thing is it remembers the last person who put in a high score and you can just hit enter for that name.  Lets see if it saves highs cores ... YES IT DOES!!!  Playing with the mouse is super precise.  Great freaking game!  (9/22/19)
* Agony - (9/23/19)  WOW The beautiful 16 color pixel art is breathtaking!  So much hand drawn detail went into this game.  Apart from the blitter background adding contrast and color the palette is so tight that its amazing that they have done so much with so little.  16 colors was simultaneously a lot and not enough back then.  Compared to 8bit computers it was some level of freedom but an artist would want more.  The animation of the bird so fluid and natural.  Its all a work of art.  The music is beautiful and exciting too.  I like that the environments dont much hurt you even going to the extreme top and bottom (afaik).  there was only once that I was killed from off screen from the back which was cheap but there wasnt much of that.  I am proud because I beat the first level including the boss!  I like that the closer you get to an enemy the faster she fires, and I like that on the boss he flickers when you hit him.  I would like it if the other enemies did that too.  The death animation is pretty gruesome with the feathers and the head flying!  I got a third of the way through the 2nd level!  That was great!  ONe thing on this emulation I couldn't get it out of PAL mode, there was cut off credits at the bottom of the screen.  I dont know if there was something else down there during gameplay too.  Update (10/2/19) WOW! I kicked ass today!  I played breathless last night and saw agony this morning in the same folder and decided to give it a go. I beat the first level without dying!  Its so fun to not die because you get so powerful.  Lets see how far I can get.  When I die I will quit since its so demoralizing and you can't possibly survive long enough to get all the powerups back when you are so weak.  Actually it doesnt take all of you powerups when you die!  So I died once or twice but got my powerups back and more and beat the second level boss on my first try!  I noticed that there is a scroll that I dont know what it does.  Wow I'm most of the way through the third level and I am doing ok.  I even got an extra life.  I love this!  YAY!  I beat level 3 also!  I noticed that it looks like there are cutscenes or at least pictures but this WHDLoad version doesnt play them for some reason.  maybe I can see them on youtube or play the non aga version another time? 4th score 130099.  its got an epic piano intro too.  The credits say the end music is written by soemone else.  Id love to hear that someday. Maybe I could beat this someday?  
* The Chaos Engine - Bitmap Bros.  Good news theres a password system!  This is an interesting game because its one that I absolutely knew I would love the first time I saw it in a magazine.  I wanted it so badd but for some reason I never bought it.  I don't really know why.  I suspect it had something to do with me not having much money and therefore having to spend it very carefully combined with thinking I could get more gaming value out of cheaper games (although I still didnt buy it a year later when it was probably on sales) combined with an assumption that someday eventually I would be able to buy, play, beat, and love all of the games I ever wanted so I took it for granted.  That was a weird attitude probably related somehow to my parents hoarding tendencies.  It was the same with some other games like: Speedball 2 (even if I wouldn't probably have liked it I always wanted it!) Lotus 2, Kick Off 2 (at least in this case I had bought Goal!  but I didnt realize that Kick Off 2 was quite a bit more accessible), Turrican 2, Chuck Rock, and others.   I suspect if I had it would have been really hard for me but maybe with a password it would have been ok.  regardless I would have loved owning it and playing it.  I absolutely loved the clarity of the graphics in this game.  YAY!  I beat one level!  Ok how does the password system work?  Maybe I have to get further on 3 lives to get a password?  I got to near the end of World 1 level 2.  Frankly I'm sad.  I'm sad that I didn't choose to buy this as a kid.  This one was one my heart really reached out for even more than those others I listed above and I think I would have actually legitimately played the hell out of this.  Probably eventually I would have found some cheats which would have made it even better but before that I would still have played it a ton and I dont know perhaps I would have beat it.  It wasnt demoralizing when I lost just now it wasnt even frustrating,  I knew I could do better if I was a little more careful.  There are plenty of checkpoints also.  I think I would have preferred a checkpoint after every level not just after every world, but I can probably live with this.  This is a great game! (9/23/19)
* Chuck Rock - Core Design - The intro video moved pretty fast so I didnt get to read it all.  The title music is familiar for some reason and it totally rocks!   Hey I beat the first screen!  The graphics are just what I expected from the magazines which was a big part of what made me want to play this.  The graphics are great!  I don't know about the controls because with some enemies it just seems like I did everything right.  Sometimes turning around takes too long.  Its pretty fun though, but I wonder whether if back in the day it would have just frustrated :(  The music is ok but gets on the nerves after a while and it seems there are no FX with the music. I got stuck in a pit with a lizard which has arrows but I dont know what to do.  I'll look at a longplay to see but back in the day I wouldn't ahve been able to!?!   I had to pick up a rock by pushing down and button which it didnt make obvious I could do (except as a pun in the title of the game) in fact they look like everything else in the background, so if I had read the manual I bet it would have mentioned that you could do that and I would have figured it out eventually.   Ok so I beat the second screen too with 0 lives left.  Ok and I beat the third screen too!  So I feel like I could have had some good fun with this but that it wouldn't have had the longevity I needed from a game.  Why did they make no games that had many of the same qualities as super mario bros?  In this game there are dozens of little puzzles to solve like how do I get up or over to that platform and the levels are designed such that you get one shot at solving many of them although usually you dont die if you dont.  you also have to walk methodically taking your time to hit everyone at just the right time since collision detection is very picky.  On my second go its more fun because I know more about chucking rocks and what I can do with them and I got to screen 3 with 2 lives left.  I just learned if you carry a rock then the falling rocks will bounce off and flying enemies will die if they hit it and you can throw it at ground enemies! There are these orange guys that have broken hit boxes so you have to hit them just perfect and you end up usually missng and then they go through you and turn around before you can and hit you again.  That kind of crap isn't fun.  Space bar switches from music to SFX on the title screen.  Highest score was 36425! Not a bad score!  The cheats actually look cool and make me want to try again using those: lots of infinite lives cheats including "Fast aint the word" indicating that you have to play it slow, but also estrano lets you fly with left shift toggle and mortimer makes f1-f5 select the stage and turn frame lets 1-5 select the level.  With just the infinite lives I'm sure I could eventually beat it and I think it would be pretty fun, but without that and without level select or passwords or anything I would have been very frustrated as a kid and would not have gotten anywhere.  Not to mention that up is jump and my amiga joystick back then wasnt the best (i had a bunch but none of them were quite right or I wasnt comfortable with them) not to mention whenever up was jump it kind of made me mad and I got frustrated that all wasnt right in the world which made me not like the games as much (mostly because my hands were not programmed to jump with up!)  Not a bad game but just not that great. (9/23/19)
* Breathless - AGA Version (9/23/19) I always wanted to play this and really I wanted to buy it.  I would have given a lot for a good doom game and this seemed like the best one.  What a part of me really wanted was to have a fast gaming PC to play Doom and Quake, but having this would have been pretty damn cool.  Ok I set it to high settings (320x200 1 pixel size) and no thats too slow.  Ok (320x200 2x2 pixel size plays smooth but looks chunky.  Lets give it a shot!  Had to switch to mouse controls, and it uses arrow keys not wasd.  7 and 1 on keypad look up and down a bit and 4 centers vertically.  Music and SFX at the same time with all this action!  The enemies are just blurry clay models but the shooting is really fun and responsive and precise.  I like it!  Its got a cool system for buying ammo and upgrades with credits that you pick up when you find a computer you can login and the menu is real simple and straightforward.  The options menu is the same way and the text is clear in both. You can even BUY Colored Keys from the terminal!  That means if you need to you can buy your way out of a puzzle you are stuck on.  I really appreciate them incorporating that into the difficulty curve of this game.   I feel like it gives you enough life for you to enjoy the game.  Its fair. If I had an A1200 and bought this game I would have eaten it up honestly.  This is great!  AND theres a password system on every level!!!  The continue structure is great!  80UCG9VOLJRJSE2W  V and U look different enough but I could have been confused by them if they werent both visible here.  I can't wait to try out the continue structure on a faster amiga emulator configuration!  Interesting that the credit pickup hitboxes are tiny so ites really easy to miss them.  One of the challenges on level two is the enemies are down some stairs and maybe smaller so you have to use the aim down.  Doom figured out height for you but this game is making it a part of the gameplay.  Thats cool either way.  There are traps and teleporters and secret doors.  its a  good game that had be dodging my torso back and forth to escape the shots.  I'm actually really into this!  The music creates a great intense atmosphere.  Oh and hot damn theres an automapper!!!  I've got to say I think the shooting is better in this game than in doom.  The firing and experience of it and then the quality of aim and actually getting a hit and the knowing when you did is extremely satisfying.  There are a few one way traps in this game where you can't go back and thats heartbreaking (but I'm not complaining) because there were some powerups back there!  YAY I beat level 2!  This is wonderful!!!  8SKSDELWLNDJSE2V I haven't even died yet!  Update (10/2/2019) I'm going to play it again actually I've been looking forward to it.  I'm running it in the A4000 Turbo UAE Setting.   I think its playing so fast that its harder!  It looks pretty good at 1x1 pixel and 320x200 and its running super smooth.  This is a really good game.  Its intense and the maps are awesome.  The sounds are great the music is creepy and cool and the graphics are very good given the obvious hardware constraints.  I'm running low on ammo (I started the level at like 600 and now am down to 363) and I hope that doesnt become a problem.  Health isnt too much of a problem because there are pickups and there are some credits I have grabbed, but shields are near gone too.  Alright!  I found a secret room with plenty of ammo and now I'm at 808.  I've been a bit more conservative with it too.  Its creepy when I hear a door open but dont know where the sound came from.   Interesting it was a room of health located back at the beginning of the level.  Thats nice!  But actually I dont know where to go now.  I just kept going back and it wasnt too hard.  1RSCGSRQL4TJSE2Q is First World - Fourth Arena.  It says Retries left 3 but I haven't died yet (or really even gotten close).  I suspect they were mot used to people playing who had quite a bit of experience with FPSs.  I will say I'm starting to feel the mouse just being the slightest bit sluggish or laggy and I wonder if thats because of the screensize that i picked?  Nevertheless this is amazing!  (10/2/19) It looks like you have to reprogram your keys every time you play I would complain about this but its really not an issue because the key configuration screen is so simple and straightforward and not buried in menus or hard to find its on the main menu.  It only takes 15 seconds.  Ooh theres a save configuration in the game options. Lets quit and see if it worked.  Well whats weird is it saved some configuration items but not others.  Weird but no problem because like I said its easy to change them.  Heres what I do: remap the keys to wasd, and lookup and down to e and q and reset vertical to r and run to left shift and then in controls I change to mouse controls and then I tweak sensitivity and rotation speeds.  I change the password in the options menu and the screens ize to 320x200 1x1.  It saved screen size and mouse controls.  OH!  Ive been looking right past the terminals.  I saw it in the last level but didnt know what it was even though I used it in the first level!  bummer but I dont have nearly enough money to buy anything substantial.  I could only get some shields.  I wanted a weapon upgrade and the cheapest bullet improvement was 1500 and I only had 1100, now I've only got 800.  I bet there are some secret rooms that I'm missing.  You know what I'm not a fan of.  there are pits that you cant get out of that would mean certain death and since there are only 3 retries it would suck to fall in.  Then again I guess I could just restart the level with my password.  So far the credits only seem to be located in semi-secret rooms (which arent really secrets but which are part of the puzzle of the level) which have keys next to them so theyre really intended and required to be found.  I havent found any extra money.  However I do now have 1600 so I'm going to backtrack to get that weapon upgrade.  The upgrade is pretty good but it uses ammo twice as fast.  trade offs I guess.  haha I backtracked got the upgrade, then went forward a few screens and there was another one :)  I'm hitting space on every wall I can see to try to find secret rooms.  well the way I was going along the walls hitting space wouldnt have worked anyway.  I tested that angle against an actual working door and it didnt open.  You have to come at the door from a pretty perpendicular angle.  Good I found some rooms with ammo and am up to 1500.   this 4th level is really quite long.  I did it!  First world - fifth arena 6FJC1DNOL4TJSEQP  Note that I cant tell whether its a 0 or a O
* Burnout - Vulcan Software (9/23/19) - Believe it or not I owned this but never played it even once :(  I had that problem back then (and you know given all of the games on steam that I have I guess I still do).  I bought a CDROM with all of the Vulcan games on it and only played a few.  I didnt give myself the time to really enjoy my games back then.  Do I still do that today?  Well I know I am better about it today, but I don't really know.  Maybe I'm not giving myself that time but am too close to the issue to see it.  hmm ... The intro text goes away way too fast and the whole intro animation had a jitter to it, maybe PAL/NTSC?. What I loved about this was how AWESOME the pre-rendered cars looked.  I just love that look.  RockNRoll racing, DKC, etc.  I also love simple untextured polygonal games like Thunderstrike or Spheres of Chaotica or Virus (Amiga) or Starglider II.  Hmm.  theres still a jitter during the gameplay loading. Update: thats interlace flickering that the whdload authors are working on.  Ok the gameplay is not what I expected at all.  I expected a futuristic racing game of some kind but its a bumper cars game.  I would have been pretty bummed to have bought this back then on the strength of the screenshots and the ads because it appears there is little depth at all.  I don't remember being impressed by the reviews but I dind't htink it would be quite like this.  The upgrade system is pretty cool with lots of good options.  I'm the winner so far in round 3.  Oh god I got knocked off the edge.  I didnte xpect that at all.  THen it goes all white and everybody is blind for a sec.  Now there are spikes on the border.  This would be a good (if somewhatshort lived) party game if it could handle four players.  Can it?  
* Bills Tomato Game - Psygnosis (9/23/19) This has a much more cartoony look than other psygnosis games.  Cute that they have the devs playing amiga on the second floor of the store in the intro.  I feel like maybe I played this, but no I dont think so. OMG someone stole the tomatoes girlfriend!!  Cool intro like a radio!  Hey theres a password system too!  TOIBBAL is the password for past level 1.  I hated the controls on the level select screen but in game its a screen based and physics based puzzle game.  Lets see how many screens I can beat without getting pissed off :) MOIVEL  The graphics are super fun and cartoony.  Ok thats it. Level 3 pissed me off.  I didn't like this but I can see why people would especially back then!
* Altered Beast - Sega - oh god this is an unplayable clusterfuck.  I would have been so sad if I had bought that thinking it was anything like the Genesis version.  ugh. (9/23/19) 
* Battletech - Infocom (9/23/19) Hey this is cool! The character is tiny which is just fine and he just moves with the cursor keys or clicking the mouse but its really a text adventure underneath.  I wonder if it used a modified version of the same interpreter?  It looks like the whole game could be played with keyboard or mouse equally well.  I wish there were more games like this.  Top down easily controlled but all of the real interactions are via text.  This is great!  I love how you enter buildings and then it becomes a text menu with a little graphic.  This would have been a really clean solution to making really sophisticated games in the 80s so I'm surprised more games didnt do it (then again maybe they did and I just didnt notice?).  It was still pretty clumsy and I didn't want to play much.  I coudlnt' get through the first training mission (which was just to run southeast and run back) even though I tried as many times as they would let me.  Seems like a good game for 1988
* Cadaver - Bitmap Bros 1992 (9/23/19) Wow the graphics are cool here.  I can tell Bitmaps style.  A demon just ducked his head out of the water!  Well I didnt know what to do much of anything, I picked up some shit and got a few screens away from the start and got killed by some eyeball thing.  I bet this could have been fun back then.   The graphics look so damn good but I was just fighting the controls the whole time I played although I bet I would get used to it if I was motivated, but I wasnt.  I wouldn't have been motivated, I would have gotten stuck in 10 minutes and not been able to proceed anywhere.  I was following a walkthrough and still couldn't do what it said (I couldn't find a green gem concealed by sacks I was supposed to move.  
* Colonization - Microprose (9/23/19) Great soundtrack and wonderful interface.  Its amiga windows!  Wow this has a kick ass soundtrack!  I love the clarity of the Intuition graphics.  I'm so glad they used amiga windows for this! I've got to say the 'foreign indian turns' window pops up right in the middle of the view which is annoying.  I started a colony and quit.  Now I'm trying the AGA version.  its cool that in the background of the AGA is an embossed looking ships backdrop!  The AGA version is real choppy because its constantly blinking and the music skips.  The ECS didnt do this.  The icons and graphics are admittedly one level more clearer, but theyre still not what I would call 'clear'. Its ok.  I have a certain fondness for Civ, but none for this even though its really impressive and cool.  I bet this gave lots of people some real great times back in the day.  
* Commando - Elite 1989 (9/23/19) Theres apparently a 2 player hotseat in this.  I can just barely hear hints of the C64 versions AMAZING music but this music is not nearly as good its underwhelming and takes AWAY from the action it doesnt make it exciting it make sit boring.  Well the shooting itself is pretty good, and the hit detection is decent for the enemies so you can hit them and they dont hit you as easily as they could.  Ultimately too hard and pretty boring.  At least it has some checkpoints and I made it to one.
* California Games 2 - EPYX 1992 (9/23/19) Not as iconic title screen music but the graphics are great and the music is fun and much better developed than before with pretty advanced mod tricks. The graphics are actually really good.  This one is not iconic like the first one but it would probably still be a good party game.  I admit I didnt see 2p options.
* Crazy Cars - Titus (9/23/19) Great title screen with blues guitar music!  This is shit.  I expected a more basic version of Crazy Cars 3 but nope.  The roadside graphics sucked the driving was weird. there were no other cars.  I have no idea what I was supposed to do so I just went as fast as I could I never went off road but it was game over.  It was cool that in Florida I could see the disneyworld castel in the background.
* Bubble and Squeak - Sunsoft (9/23/19) I think this means sausages in england.  There is a password system! Wow these are AWESOME graphics for ECS.  Is this ECS?  It didnt say AGA on the WHDLoad.  Its got to be AGA.    its so colorful and beautiful and well drawn and stylized.  The music is fun and interesting too.  Controls are great.  I havent even done anything real in game and given those first impressinos and that its sunsoft I'm looking forward to this.  The controls are really great.  Getting picky: it seems like your feet have to be planted an instant too long to make a second jump which is really messing with me.  Also the hitboxes on the jewels are nearly broken so you can still get them but you have to put them in the center of your body.  The same goes for the switches which you have to hit with the exact center of your starshot but when its up to you dying then its pixel perfect with the edge of your body.  Ok I got past level 1 on my second life!  Its pretty good.  I will say I'm not compelled to keep playing.  I'm not excited.  I can't really relate to the characters at all, but it is fun and cute and pretty well made.  JDRSMFKQ HEY there is a password system after every level!  Now I'm way more interested!  Yay!  Hmm it keeps the number of lives and hearts from one level tothe next.  I bet it saves that in your password too.  Still any password is better than none.  At least donuts are healthy in this game :) Ok so now I'm figuring out that this is a puzzle game to some degree.  I had to look up on a longplay that you can kick him into a ball and he shoots all over.  The Neverglades One: JDRJQLTQ   I got to a sticking point and didnt feel compelled to play anymore.  Well crafted for sure and not too bad.  Hmm.  this password didnt work on the AGA/CD32 version!?!   Maybe it wasnt AGA or maybe there was several aga versions?  Theres nothing really wrong with this game but I'm glad I didnt buy it back then.
* Crazy Sue - Indie platformer 1990 (9/23/19) I hadnt heard of this but it sounded and looked interesting.  The music is pretty rocking.  Controls are ok but a bit stiff, the level and enemy design is punishing but not in a fun way.  Position yourself on the left side of this platform and time the jump just right or you die.  Alright after 10 tries I beat level 1!  Its not great and I wouldnt enjoy playing it anymore, but I might have played it more back in the day.  Maybe.  Its pretty punishing though so maybe not much.
* Cubix - Puzzle game (9/23/19) This isnt bad.  I wouldnt have been happy if I had paid full price for this but if I had gotten this on a coverdisk or if the difficulty curve isnt too bad then I might have enjoyed it for a while. This is like the quality of a $1-3 iphone game.  Except you only get three lives because in 1991 they had to meet that convention.  I was going to try it a few more times but that burned me.  I only beat one level.  Not bad though and a good brain teaser because you have to think through your moves ahead.
* 3D Construction Kit - (9/23/19) This was also called The Virtual Reality Toolkit featuring Freescape II.  It is pretty great for back then and pretty detailed and while I'm not going to spend any more time trying to figure out how to wield it, I'm impressed.
* Cybernoid - The fighting machine - Hewson 1988 (9/23/19) When I got game over it said "please stick to space invaders" Ok you dont have to ask me twice ;) its not bad and could be an interesting diversion.  I feel lik eif I had this on C64 I would have spent more time with it exploring the caves but as it is its not great.  Also if it had infinite lives but at least it has 5 not the usual 3.
* BC Kid - Hudson Soft and Factor 5.  (9/23/19) Cool animated bee logo for the intro.   Never booted. never played.
* Battletoads - 1992 Mindscape Rare - (9/23/19) Ok the animated intro is colorful and good.  It does have 2player coop.  when you die it says "Most non non non Henious,dude!  gimme your most excellent handle!"  haha Well the game sucked in part because it needs one more button so jumping and moving didnt make sense but the movement was also just choppy enough that it would have been even tougher than usual.  there was nothing intersting about this port and I'm glad I didnt buy it back then.  It might be the best port ever and Id like to find out that is true even if it would surprise me.  Ok now what about the CD32 version?  Graphics are instantly clearer, sound is the same.  hopefully the controls use several buttons.  WOW The intro is way clearer!  Best battle toads intro Ive ever seen! Both versions have only music or sfx not both.  It will let you play simultaneous 2p.   I dont believe it.  they didnt change the controls to match the CD32 controller!  What a load of shovelware!  I bet someone at rare was pissed.  
* Battlechess - 1988 Interplay - (9/23/19) wow the graphics are SO GOOD on this game for the Amiga.  I remember the first time I saw it at a friends house I loved it! I think its really cute since this is an 80s computer that it has to take a few seconds (5-10) to consider its moves.  Today all that stuff is done instantaneously (and theyre smarter moves :) ) Now its taken 15 seconds :) This is honestly a really fun game of chess.  I think its my favorite on any system!  Something about the animations adds an enormous amount to the fun of a typical chess game for me :)  OH NO THEY BEAT ME!!  I dont know for sure but I think its in part because of the small amount of thinking time that the computer gives me that I like it so much.   What a blast!  Wow you can even save your game, or set up the board however you want it to simulate a match from the past and figure out new moves.  What a really great game!!!  AnD its got a modem mode so you could play against friends in other lands!  WOw i love it.
* Blues Brothers - 1991 Titus - (9/23/19) cool guitar music on title screen.  oh god its terrible though.  I feel like I played a demo ofthis on my amiga back in the day and didnt like it but I dont remember this crap at all.  I got pretty far into the first level the second time I tried but boy it sucked. 
* Bubble Bobble - 1987 Taito - (9/23/19) WOW this is so colorful and arcadey.  The music is good.  It loosk JUST like the arcade as I remember it.  Looks like a great port of the game with great music and graphics.  I don't want to play it though :) There are cheats for next level, last level, and infinite lives.  I jumped to the last level and couldnt do a damn bit of damage and quit.
* Bards Tale 1,2,3 - Interplay (9/23/19) I have mixed feelings about this.  I bought the third game but I never made any real progress.  I have amazing memories about it and I got way into the fantasy of it and tried my hardest but no matter how long I spent the enemies overpowered me.  I thought that although you could import characters from the previous game, you could start with new characters and be ok.  Well apparently you reallly cant. T hey included some characters on the disk with some good weapons so you werent actually starting from total scratch, but back then I thought that was cheating so I never touched those guys and suffered with my total newbs with no weapons or armor.  I'm proud that I did as well as I did, I got some characters levelled up a bit, I made it to the other dimension once (in a grove of trees or something) I didn't know that it really required you to make maps so I figured i could just keep it all in my head, no big deal, that a map would help but wasnt mandatory.  Well realistically it was mandatory.  I always thought it was unfair that traps would send me to lower levels of the dungeons.  Id dint know how to light up the dungeons at first but eventually figured that out a little bit.  It was painful but I dug in and tried my hardest.  I think if I had had some way to ask other people what to do they would have said "you have to make maps" and "You have to start with the party they made or at least rip off their weapons" and I would have been so much better off.  I'm proud of myself that I made it into the first actual dungeon even if I never beat it.  I don't remember the third game scrolling as smooothly as this one does.  I remember not knowing where I was in the city (map would have helped) and looking for doors but sometimes it wouldn't show the door even if it was on the side unless you turned toward it.  I even played the game at first on my C64.  About this game: the UI is pretty good.   Hey I'm pretty sure when they heal the player its a sample from Monty Python don ah aes requiem.  haha!  Its cool that I can use the keyboard shortcuts for everything.  Well now I killed off all of the built in ATEAM so I would have to do quite a bit to proceed any further.  I will give up.  Lets play Bards Tale 2: The destiny knight, well there was some glitch with this one where it was clicking too much so I gave up.  Still have mixed feelings about these games.    Alright lets do Bards Tale 3:  Wow the intro is really taking me back!  "Come hear the tale of Skara brae ... Garth Roscoe Kylearean too"  Wow sounds crazy but although the UI is better than BT1, I'm not sure the window of graphics are as good.  NO HOLY SHIT!  Theyre not as good!  In BT1 on Amiga they scroll the littlest bit.  In this they dont at all!?!  holy crap!  Also holy crap, the mouse pointer is off by a pixel or two which means I'm repeatedly clicking on the wrong shit.  Also when you click on someone it takes 2 seconds to load.  Way too long.  Well I found Skara Brae and went into the town and found a house full of stuff.  I always wanted to get far in this game and maybe even beat it but thats all the patience I have for this game. 
* Archer MacLeans Pool (9/23/19) I remember being really impressed wiht the 3D Graphics on this game.  Lets try it again.  The 3D sure is awesome.  I'm not having much fun with it atm.  Its cool that there are creepy eyes in the background when its waiting for me. :) and then flies.   I guess I would just have to practice a lot to get good at it and I'm not motivated to do that. Until then its not fun for me to lose at this game.  There are so many more that are fun.  Nothing wrong with it though.  Quality is top notch.
* Alien Breed 92 Special Edition - Team 17 (9/23/19) wow the graphics on this are amazing! I bought Alien Breed for PS3 at one point.  I'm not referring to the awesome impact modern games but I bought those too and loved them and beat them a few years ago which were exciting and creepy and awesome dual stick shooters. No I bought the classic somehow on PS3 and I got reasonably far.  Hey I'm proud of myself that I figured out that I can activate a terminal with the space bar.  Its actually a lot like the alien breed impact kidn fo terminal.  The terminal looks SO FUTURISTIC!   Theres a map in the terminal too!  I have a feeling theres a cheat in place.  Not sure.  What is the continue structure like in these games? Alright game over and I didnt' make it past level one.  But I will enjoy playing that later though :) Great game!
* Creatures - Thalamus (9/23/19) I think we had a demo of this and if its the one I am thinking of then I totally loved the puzzles and gore of the demo!  Nope I dont think this is the one.  but it looks great nevertheless.  I love blitter backgrounds.  I wonder if this is AGA?  it looks like it must be.  Ok you cant go backwards which is interesting.  I like the character, but man Amiga platformers were stiff compared to Super Mario Bros.  This game requires lots of pixel perfect jumping.  It is letting me start exactly where I died.  Well all my lives are gone and I didnt make it past hte first level.  That was a pretty good amiga platformer, but I don't think I'll play it again.  
* Chuck Rock 2 Son of Chuck.  (9/23/19)  I always wanted to play this one (although I wanted Chuck Rock more)  this game has sound and FX at the same time.  Four layers of scrolling, great collision detection, Great dithered graphics.  The music is a little off or something.  Like its playing too fast.  Its pretty mild background tunes but the way it is I dont really like it. Zone 1 down!  The characters are all drawn in fun ways.  The men look super goofy and the women have very large breasts.  Zone 2 down! They give enough health refills that its fair.  Zone 3 down.  Zone 4 down.  The firs tboss was great!!  Now I'm on the back of dippy the diplodocus!  Some bird flew down and I dont know what I was supposed to do but there are some missing sprites and graphical glitches since the bird. Now I'm in Monkey Trouble Zone 1. and game over and I was pretty far through that one!  Well although I'm not in the mood to play it anymore right now, I like how genrally fair that was.  It should have a better continue structure (like most platformers) but it was otherwise fair and my sister and me would have had much fun with that if we had bought it back in the day.  I picked easy level.  CD32 version looks 100% identical and it doesnt even use the extra buttons up is still jump.
* Barbarian (Palace) (9/23/19)  this is the one pugman can beat!  I feel like if he can do it it might be fun to get good at it by doing what he did and practicing, but at this point its not good enough to spend that time with.  Its cool that it was out there and I bet it would have been fun if I had picked it up for a few bucks.  
* Body Blows Galactic (9/23/19) (I am not sure whether its AGA but it looks like it has to be but thers another version that is specifically AGA.  Its got some great sounds: music and sfx and kind of a lot of digitized speech. aZONA can be pretty cheap with her down right punch move.  Its a bit hard to tell when you get hit.  Junior is super cheap.  I could hardly hit him or get up.  I beat the first two guys ok but after that died quick.  Slightly more fun than that previous body blows I played but I don't know if I was invested i could probably learn more moves and get better at it.  AGA version looks the same.
* Blades of Steel Konami (9/23/19) This didnt work at all.
* Alien Syndrome Sega (9/23/19) Trainers with tab key activates infinite time and lives and I was able to slow the whole game down.  This could be very much fun played like this, maybe I could actually beat it!?!  hotseat coop!  I have a special place in my heart for this game because on the C64 I had a Sega pack with this and Afterburner and Thunderblade and Shinobi and I was so proud to have those actual arcade games and be cool like the other kids and people who played real games but they were very hard but this game was the only one where I could play it for a while and actually reach the boss.  A part of me thought and maybe hoped that the first boss was the boss of the game and didnt think about what would happen after.  I dont think I ever beat that boss on C64 but just getting close was inspirational and made me feel really good about myself.  Well this version the graphics are in some ways terrible.  They are real cartoony and dont to me invest me in the space theme at all.  The scrolling is wonky and requires you to get too close to the leading edge of the screen for you to see anything that you're about to run into.  The boss takes a ridiculous number of hits (maybe there was a way to upgrade my gun that I missed.  I think I missed that) and is cheap the whole time with an enormous invisible attack hit box around him, and cheap slugs that take many hits have tiny hit boxes to kill them and track your movement too precisely for you to avoid getting killed repeatedly.  I died probably 30 times on the boss.  Ok i beat round one.  Thats not fun.
* Blood Money Psygnosis (9/23/19).  Wow the intro to this has tons of awesome speech and then great samples in the intro mod.  "Shut your mouth and look at my what" Really fun intro mod!  The gameplay isnt good imho.  Its shooting in helicopters or other things wiht upgradeable ships and weapons but the hitboxes on the enemies are all screwed up and the player lane is so tiny you will die 1000 times just hitting walls and obstacles, and it puts you in places where the enemies are certain to come but also where you cant hit them from there.  grr.  2 player hotseat co op though!  
* Bionic Commando Konami (9/23/19) - Cool animated screen!  Oh wow this looks like thearcade version not the NES version!  I just finished the modern remake of the NES version on my PC a month ago and it was awesome.  lets see about this one!  wow great intro mod with great synth arpeggios!  Well the gameplay stunk.  You moved like molasses and so clumsy, fall and you cant fire your arm.  This game really needs two buttons.  Also I didn't know where the fuck to go and everything moved so slowly.  you even fell super slow.  I remember the arcade game being fun and this looked a smidge like it, it resembled the arcade but boy it stunk.
* 4D Sports Boxing Mindscape (9/24/19)  Ok I've got this running on WinUAE Full Speed mode (not cycle exact) I remember seeing this and loving the graphics and knowing what it would look like (I imagined it being silky smooth polygon animations) and loving that look.  Its cool intro cutscenes before the fight.  this is a well made game so far!  Its pretty smooth at full speed though I wouldnt call it fast paced, its not.  The controls are better than I thought they would be for back then.  You move around forward back left and right relative to your opponent and when you punch it punches relative to how you are aiming.  There are a lot of quirky long pauses for some reason and then it catches up.  Maybe in another emulation mode or with another processor it would work better?  Ok trying it on Amiga 4000 JIT configuration.  WOW I picked Paul Savage and he savaged Larry Lunchbucket DQ in Round 1.  Also It didnt slow down at all.  It worked really really well.  I love the variation in how the lowpoly boxers look.  Alright! On my next match I got 41% landed which was better than his 35% and I got 44 total better than his 32!  Interesting it still had that several second hiccup from time to time even on this blazing fast machine.  Mabye its because its not cycle exact.  This is a really good game.  Ok this time I still did better than him.  but not by as much and Im still in the lead.  This is a 10 round game so it might take a while.  Lets see how I hold up.    One really cool thing is the Fkeys change the viewing angle entirely.  There are a bunch of camera angles to use including perspective from either player and then an isometric view of the ring with the audience (my fav atm)  I'm kicking his ever loving ass now!  this time it was 80/130 to his 16/75!  Its still occasionally got that pausing problem.  This game certainly depends a lot on which boxers you picked and I picked one that was favorable to me but not by a vast amount like last time.  This time its Rookey de Fult vs Banarama Smith.  I KNOCKED HIM DOWN in round 5 YAY!!!  Overall it was me 258/503 (51%) and him 90/346 (26%) Theres some cool Ladies and Gentlemen speech.  Holy crap!  Wait.  I got disqualified for some reason!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?  He won!!!  holy crap!! I don't know what I did maybe when he was knocked down I was supposed to back off or something???  Well thats just something I dont know and that is still a FANTASTIC boxing game.  I think one of the reasons I like it so much is its slow pace.  It lets me think a bit and gather my wits and change tactics.  The animation wasnt slow it was the game loop speed on purpose because all of the speeds of winuae ran the same game speed.  What a game!  Ok when I run it cycle exact it doesnthave any of htose pauses and its still the same general speed.  This time against a tougher opponent I got 37/98 (37%) and the crushah got 19/53 (35%)  I don't think I'll play it alot again but it was a great experience and I'm really impressed.
* Alien Breed Team 17 (9/24/19) This is not the special edition.  This is apparently 2 players.  Is it hotseat?  Well I dont know if I like this atm.  The map is confusing and there arent enough keys or health.  Probably if you play each map and explore and die and go back and play it again you will figure out the maps but I'm not motivated to do that.  I think I want something more accessible.  Or maybe I'm doing something wrong?  Its high quality for sure though.
* Alien Breed 2 (ECS) Team 17 (9/24/19)  Wow its really cool that they have a slideshow of other cool games by Team17 in the intro sequence.  Ok this one has a level code in the options menu.  did the other one??? Wow everything about the art here (the dithering, the blitter effects, the UI), is amazing.  There is a trainer in the WHD Load wiht infinite energy and lives.  So yes it is hotseat co op.  You can even choose to share all collected credits.  Ok so its demoralizing when you die so quickly that you cant get anywhere even on the first level.  Its a tough game which can be about navigating a maze, and key and ammo management in addition to shooting and moving and surviving.  Its pretty tricky to figure out where to go on level 1 and I finally did but only just before dying.  lets try that again.  the presentation of this game is epic and amazing btw.  Ok I made it Just to the second room.  It took two lives.  Im at level 2 civilian zone 1.  Ok the continue structure is pretty broken.  It says in the 'hints' in the terminal that 2 secret mission codes will be revealed to you as the game progresses.  Use these codes to continue your progress in the later stages of the game.  So I don't have to make it all the way through the game, just 1/3 through?  How long is it?  90 minutes if you know how to beat it (longplays on youtube)?   So they want me to make it >30 minutes through these mazes when I can't even make it 2 minutes?  I'll make it 1 min longer per try and every time I do I will have to do the first levels over and over.  And then do that 2 more times? Nope.   Frankly if I had bought this back then I might have been able to do it.  If I put my mind and time to it I think I could pull it off but that doesnt mean its not a broken continue system.  That kind of punishment is fine for a hard mode but not for an easy or normal mode.  I got a lot further on my second go.  Got a top score of 93970.  On the attract screen the player starts with a way more powerful weapon.  thats part of my problem because the first problem is that the green aliens shoot from just off the screen so you cant see the shot coming (which is cheap) the second is that when they come at you your weapon isnt powerful enough to kill them anytime soon so even if you start aimperfectly and sstart attacking them instantly theyll still usually hit you before theyre dead.  Mixed feelings here.
* Alien Breed 2 (AGA) Team 17 (9/24/19) This one has a trainer with 99 lives and 99 keys and 100000 credits.  More importantly it says press n to skip levels!  thats my boy!!!  It works!!! See now its sort of achieveable because you can maybe start where you left off.  You wont have the guns or ammo or money but maybe thats ok?  The graphics are just way clearer on the AGA version and because of that and the skip level cheats this is probably the version to play but the aliens still make it too damn hard to be fun.  Its supposed to be this legendary game and maybe it is but I'm not having that experience with it. my experience is just demoralizing and unpleasant (although it looks so cool on the surface and even when you dip your toes in).  I tried with one of the other players but it didnt make any difference.  Maybe the dino players would?  One of the dinos has no extra ammo or credits but has a 3 way weapon, and its better, but its really only marginally better.  It doesnt mean you can tear through enemies you jsut have a slightly better chance of beating them.  This is like playing gauntlet but every ghost takes 10 hits.  How do you overcome that kind of overwhelming odds?  Its not fun like this.  Update: I watched a longplay and when you get the high level rebounder with like 29k it becomes a very different game.  I wonder if with some cheats and that gun it might be a lot of fun.  I wonder if I could follow the longplay and get that gun and have more fun with this game?
* Baal Psygnosis (9/24/19) I owned this and have some nice memories of it.  I first saw it in magazines and loved the cover and the art work and I remember when I got it it being amazing to look at.  It blew my mind.  And some of the shooting was really fun.  I remember it being one of the first games that I ever played that I acknowledged to be too hard for me to play much anymore and I kind of gave up.  Remember also that back then playing a game was an investment because loading took several minutes every time, and then sometimes every time you died it would be several minutes to load the level again. The last time I played this was probably 1992 Ok lets try it in 2019.  Well actually first impressions are that its good!  I like the shooting and I like the animations.  The backgrounds are cool and the controls are good.  theres one enemy design problem: You cant duck but even the first enemy is lower than your gun.  You have to wait for him to be as high as your gun to hit him and by then hes hit you 5 times.   This is all in the first 30seconds.  Control for jump is weird.  Its not a second button, nor is it pushing up. Its pushing fire and up.  One cool thing is that there are coordinates on your hud.  Thats really cool because that means they can refer to them in game or in walkthroughs or hint books.  Oh god the enemies that shoot your knees respawn as soon as you step off screen.  Oh god its one of *those* games.  If you fall off a ledge that means you fall to your death. If you jump youre ok to fall a bit further but dont step too close to the edge.   ugh. not just damage but instant death. and that is compounded by the edges of the platforms do not coincide with when your characters feet actually leave the edge.  It comes far sooner than you would think which means you will be falling to your death a lot and not because you didnt jump but because the game was so imprecise that it didnt give you enough live information (feet vs edge of platform) about when to jump.  Maybe it does though: if your toe is one to two pixels off the edge you're ok to hold the button and then push up and to the right.  If your leading toe is four pixels off the edge you will fall to  your death  Something like that.  Its counter intuitive since the characters center of gravity would be far behind the leaeding toe and because most games you can walk to near the back toe or mid of feet is off the edge.  This one has a wide stance but the leading edge is the one that make shim fall.  not cool.  Also in this game jumping is a big part and iirc something you have to do with people chasing you up and down and left and right, and even if theyre not chasing just  yet its something you have to do far from the starting platform so you have to lead out really far to the edge, risk falling to your death, try to make the jump hope you make it, and also dont hold down the jump and upright combo for an instant past the landing or you will jump again probably right into a beast or an electric beam.  Also you can run out of laser ammo.  Ammo management seems to be one of my least favorite activities in games.  Some electricity you can walk behind.  Others its instant death.  In hindsight its got a kind of dark castle feel to it because its so unforgiving and you have to be so precise, but its deeper and more apparently typical run and gun shooter than dark castle with a totally different atmosphere setting and style so I never saw the similarities before.  It was written and designed by one guy in the mid 80s which is what first started me thinking of it.  For some reason there are a lot of death checkpoints which aren't obvious but they are closely spaced together.  And for some reason I am compelled to keep trying to see if I can get further and how far I can actually get.  Thats true even though I know my progress is hard won with tons of deaths and restarts (which take a long time since the camera scrolls dramatically but too slowly back to your last checkpoint).  Ok I got one little metal triangle ball and it gave me 200 personal status.  thats good right?  Well no because it looks like they are reset each time you die!?!   Ok I'm proud of myself that I figured out that I need to shoot some electric beacons to turn off the electric fences, and I'm proud that I got in a flying chair that came out of a red dr who phone booth (we know Wayne Smithson is a Dr Who fan!) and I beat an enemy who had a really cool death animation of a demon flying into the sky! I died in the phone booth I guess I slightly pressed down while I was flying my chair trying to exit the phone booth.  I have no idea how to beat the little purple guys who are trying to bite my knees or how to beat any of the enemies without taking a ton of hits. Still I am having some fun with this believe it or not!?!  I thought I might, then I thought for sure I wouldn't but now surprisingly I am.  I got a high score of 1700!!!  OMG sadly it doesnt even save high scores!?!  :(  I would have had #1 spot.  its kind of hilarious that it doesnt save them because the high score list is extensive, it displays fifty different high scores but apparently wipes them out every time!?! I wonder if thats something the WHDLoad could conceivably do something about???  Ok theres a cheat if you press the right mouse button when the screen blanks while the game loads you get unlimited lives.  This absolutely should have been the default.
* Batman The Caped Crusader 1988 Ocean (9/25/19)- Great music!  I owned this and I have fond memories of it but I never got anywhere with it.  I actually think I had this med mod on my mod disk.  This is a great song! the pixel art and animation is awesome and the comic book style is unmatched!  It looks like there is a timer, but with a slight memory of playing this 20 years ago I was able to get through 10% of the puzzles of the joker section.  This is a cool game which is really a puzzle adventure (not my style) and I died several times.  The punching hitbox is way too small and I kicked once but cant figure out how to do it again, but I died and I give up.  The enemies and everything looks amazing!  Its kind of like a text adventure because there is just as much logic and clues to what youre supposed to be doing and with that said I might just be able to save robin if I spent a few hours with the walkthrough (that comes with the WHD Load).  
* Beverly Hills Cop 1990 (9/25/19)- Wow the intro music from this really takes me back.  I don't htink I realized even when I got into the movie in the 90s but I'm pretty sure I had this amiga mod!  THats part of why I liked the movie so much and why I like the song so much these days.  I had a feeling that I knew the song from somewhere and I assumed it was just from the movie but it was the MOD!  It also sounds more 'right' this way to me.  One amazing thing is how close the mod could get to the actual song since they were both synthesized.  Ok lets give this a go.  Oh god the controls and level and enemy ai design are so terrible I'm done.  I gave it a good 3 minutes.  
* Castlevania Konami (9/25/19)- I always wanted to be good at this game on NES so if I had gotten this on Amiga I wonder would I have liked it?  This was one of those mystical NES games which 'everybody' had and had theoretically already beat except me: Kid Icarus, Ninja Gaiden, Ghosts and Goblins, Wizards and Warriors, etc.  That was what was in my head.  Who is this wizard on one of the title screens??? The music on the title screen isnt on the NES. Start the game and theres a decent version of the NES music.  Whoa wait ... does that say "continue a saved game!?!"  That would have been my hero back then!  The castle in the intro screen looks lame and not spooky compared tohte NES.  Well controls are quite different.  You move faster (though with jerky animation) and you tap to swing whip and hold to shoot weapon.  You can sometimes jump onto the stairs, knockback is still there.  THe enemies come at you jsut a bit too fast for teh controls to allow you to react.  The hitboxes or movement calculations are terrible, and the whips inner hitbox ends way too far from you so its easy to whip at an enemy and for them to be too close to hit.  its impossible not to get hit in the underground section on level 1.  So for continues if you die it wipes out all of your hearts and your weapon upgrades but doesnt start you at the beginning but it keeps your time so it will be easy to run out on later levels and will be really frustrating.  I'm so proud I barely beat the bat on level 1!!! two blocks of life left and zero lives.  The graphics are clearer than the NES for sure, but I don't think any of the animations are as good and it all moves a bit too fast and jerky.  The medusas are not as cheap in this game.  Wow I can't believe you can save one game at any time.  Thats a total game changers wrt continue structure.  It doesn't have to be complicated or extensive to be effective.  You don't have to make a complicated menu with many different game saves for it to help you progress.  This is still incredibly difficult even with that save feature.  I also don't know whether it saves what room you were on but it does save what level you were on.  thats wonderful and I had fun playing it and I might continue later!
* Crystal Kingdom Dizzy (9/25/19) - wow they actually use the game genie logo to ask for a password!?! At least it has a password system.  Well I dont care for the look of this character and never have.  I dont care for the cutesy music either (well its ok) but actually the controls are good and it seems like it could be a cool adventure.  I honestly wish there were more straightforward platforming experiences like this.  Loads of platform games (especially movie adaptations) would have benefitted from using the basic gameplay of this game.  I dont want to play anymore but that wasn't nearly as bad as I expected it would be.  Update: the song was stuck in my head for 45 minutes *sheepish grin*
* BAT (9/25/19) - I owned this, I think I bought it when Computerwise had it on sale.  wow the presentation and graphics of this game are amazing.  Hey its Ubisoft!  Theres some level of character creation in the game if you click the right mouse button.  Its apparently a point and click adventure which is not my kind of game, but lets try it out.  First of all I dont even know how to start playing honestly.  none of the buttons or keys does anything.  it says there is interrogation, combat, flying, and a computer in your arm, and it gives you a pretty good text description of what to do in the game if you right click until  esp is selected.  Wow theres a programming language in your arm for conversations?  Also the windows of the game make it end up looking like a comic book! Pretty impressive and amazing game for a point and click adventure.  Really not my style but really cool. 
* Aztec Challenge 1987 (9/25/19) - I had this for C64 and Betsy and me played this a lot.  It was really hard for us to get anywhere but it was cool to try because if we really tried we did eventually get further and further. Oh! This is by a company who was selling C64 conversions for the amiga: Donkey Kong, Bagitman, AztecChallenge, Frantic Freddie, Pharaohs Curse for $1 or 1 floppy disk plus $2 postage from Holland and he  would deliver in 12 days worldwide.  Apparently you can skip levels in this version to some degree.  Hey I made it to the stairs!!!  Hey I made it to the temple beating the stairs on my first try!  I think we only once or twice ever made it past this part.  Its got many continues per section probably like 20!!!  this is great!  I didnt beat the temple but I did well.  Thats a great port and much better and more fair than the original.
* Cannon Fodder CD32 - Great music of course!  Completed Missions: 1, 2.1, 2 and man it so intense!  I didnt lose anyone!  Maybe I can use cheats to pick up from there later?  Saved to disk.  Hopefully it will load later ith 47:0 and 38,6,3,0 squad. I dont understand how the CD32 version saved game but thats ok!  What a great game
* Assassin Special Edition Team 17 (9/25/19)I used to own this game and I thought it was great fun, however it was very hard and I didnt get terribly far, though I got farther than many of the other games I tried to play or beat.   I enabled a cheat that allows for N=Level Skip.  "The Evil Midan tyrant of the highest order ..." GREAT voice sampled intro!  Pressing N skips to the next level!  Thats great!  I can continue where I left offf.  This is a keeper!  Ive gotten to the end of the easy mode game before but it says that you have to play the whole game over on hard mode to play the rest of the game.  I think its the missile command that was the end of the easy mode because I dont remember the genetic asylum at all.  This is level 3.1 aka level 9. Alright! I beat that level!  Now I'm onto level 10 or 3.2.  It seems like if you jump in apparently random places it gives you bonuses that drop from the sky.  The controls are quite tight and only a bit awkward when going over corners when you are hanging from the ceiling or jumping off walls.  The level design in this asylum level is uninspired, but still I love playing it.  Its a really good run and gun game with a broken continue structure (until this cheat).  Ok I beat level 3.2 (10), and then 3.3 (11).  they were both uninspired but still fun.  It doesn't need to be complex to be interesting to play. It doesnt need to use any advanced features to be interesting to play, although if thats all it was it might be a bit boring in time.  Ok I died on 3.4 with 167580 which was the number 2 score.  It says it lets you save high scores.  This is a winner and a keeper!
* Curse of the Azure Bonds (9/25/19) I always thought this looked really cool and fantastic but it also always seemed over my head and something that wouldn't draw me in enough.  It seemed like even back then it outclassed my player skills and my attention span even though I didnt really know anything about it.  I just read enough and got enough impressions from enough source to get a feel for whether I liked that or not.  Wow so this interface is a lot like Bards Tale.  I found a guy who I can buy from.  The graphics of the town are not nearly as nice and artistic as bards tale but believe it or not for some reason I seem to be able to find my way around town much easier than I did in bt.  Its like in that game it seemed like everythign looked the same and here there is more uniqueness.  also in this game you bump into things that they describe in the world more often like npcs and it reads signs to you like "you see a sign that labels this door the sage filan" or "This is the temple of syrinx".  One really cool thing is it has a coordinate system so you know where you are.  Thats a big deal imho and I would have given a lot for that in bt.  Theres also a local overhead map with an arrow pointing in your direction and location.  So tbh I'm having an easier time getting into this than I ever did with bt (at least bt3).  I kind of would have liked to get into a battle but I didnt know how.  I gave it about 10min and am glad I did.  I learned a lot.
* Beneath a Steel Sky CD32 (9/25/19) Virgin - I always wanted to play this and heard good things and thought it would be cool.  You can start from a code.  this reminds me of spacequest but gritty and realistic.  And it reminds me of watching a movie!  WOW its got voice acting!  The whdload version does lots of blinking and flashing between clips of voice and video.  The voice acting is good, but theres a lot of static in the voices.  I got to a code: 000000  Well I dont know what to do and dont like these kind of point and click games at all, but it looks actually amazing if it was in its original form or CD32 (as long as the actual one didnt have the tons of voice static and lots of flashing during conversations)
* Alien Breed 3D (9/25/19) Team 17 - Playing on A4000 Compatible configuration cycle exact 2x.  The menu is crappy compared to Team17s usual polished interface.  There is a password system, but I wonder how often they give you a password.  Ok so the graphics are super chunky and blurry.  Wolfenstein is so much clearer than this even on an old PC.  Still the atmosphere of the textures is there, and whenyou press the m key you get good old keyboard and mouse controls.  Escape should bring up a menu but instead it totally quits the game without asking you if you want to abandon all of your progress!?!  The shooting is really good actually.  the 3d graphics are terrible (at least in this mode), the enemy sprites are ok but cartoony, and the level is way too complicated for the first level of a 3d game (which many amiga owners would have never played before).  I just read that there is no high resolution mode so even if I had a faster amiga it wouldnt matter.  I fell into water and dont know how to get out of it.  One really weird thing is you get stuck on barrels and cant slide around them.  Update:  It isn't as hard or complicated as I thought.  I was just getting used to it and in fact the first level is really well designed and thought through and is a lot of fun but damn I ran out of ammo but somehow maneuvered the bad boys out of the way of the exit and made it out of level 1.  This game is really really good.  password: KMENAIFNFFFFFFFF  That password worked!  however when I got through the level I was out of ammo so you start the second level with no ammo.  Now you get a bit of ammo right hten but it might be better to play the first level again until you get more ammo.  The levels are actually really good and they have layers in 3 dimensions which doom didnt have.  There are huge floating meatballs just like in doom which splatter the same way.  I had forgotten that I had a shotgun and probably could have used that in the first level when I ran out of ammo, but I used half of my pistol load on the big guy and didnt kill him.  the shotgun was much better.  You can't look up or down in this game at all.   Whoever balanced the difficulty of this game did a great job.  Its fair.  The enemies dont kill you too quickly but they do take damage so they are still scary.  Theres pretty much plenty of extra ammo (on these early levels anyway).  The enemies have a great sploshing sound when they die.  Alright! I beat level 2!!! EKGGEGEOLOHHFFFF  My health was pretty low but ammo was ok. Fun trivia: one guy programmed both of these 3d games by himself.  Genius.  This was one of the only games Team17 didnt publish themselves.  I wonder if thats why it wasnt so difficult as their other games?  Another theory?  Maybe the people in the office were amazing studs at top down 2d shooters but sucked at 3d shooters, maybe for them this was super hard and alien breed 2 was a cakewalk? 
* Alien Breed 3D 2 (9/25/19) Team 17 - This one is way more doom like.  The graphics are way way better although I really dont think they are as good as doom but they are creepier than doom (and doom was pretty creepy).  On my 2x a4000 emulator its framerate is low but playable.   Wow even the first level in this game is amazing!  The elevators are weird they dont give you time to get off.  Hey it looks like I beat level 1.  Thats a great game too and it has a save game option when you beat each level!  Yay!  I'm really happy with that game!!!
* After Burner (9/25/19) Sega - Well the music and graphics and explosions were pretty good.  Its a pretty good version of After Burner.  The trainer has infinite everything and level select so this is probably the best way to play that game.  It just wasnt that compelling for me to want to play anymore.
* Amegas (9/25/19) By Guido Bartels.  Music by Karsten Obarski.  This is a decent arkanoid clone.  I didnt like that the width of the paddle didnt correspond to its hit box to my eyes.  The title music is so classic for me because one of the first few things I ever did on my amiga was load up this mod which had been given to me by the computer store on a disk with like 15 other mod songs for the MED music program.  This is soaked in nostalgia for me and it still sounds fantastic to my ears.  The song was foundational to me in some ways.  I liked the shadow effect onall of the blocks and everything.  I didn't love the game though and probably wont come back to it.
* Adventure Construction Set (9/25/19) EA I'm trying to create an adventure disk. having trouble and can't get this one working.  giving up.
* After Burner Activision - AWESOME title screen music.  This one has worse graphics and animations by far, however it uses the mouse which is WAY better and it has tons of quality voice samples.   Still its not great.
* Capital Punishment AGA 1996 (9/25/19) Click Boom I remember really wanting this game.  I remember it had a dominatrix or something in it.  Yup nips and all.  The graphics are really good in this game.  Its really bloody like MK but even more adult with the nipples out.  and ugh she bends over when she wins!?! The gameplay is utterly terrible.  The development was [Fraught with controversy](http://obligement.free.fr/articles_traduction/story_about_clickboom.php)
* Birds of Prey (9/25/19) I always wanted to buy and own this one.  I think I had or saw a demo of this and was totally sold especially when I learned that it had so many planes available.   i remember that it had 40 planes.   There are a bunch of missions you can fly.  Every key seems to have some function that it toggles between which is pretty intuitive.  Theres an easy flight mode which I appreciate.  Ive been trying to take off for a while though.  Well I never was able to take off.  I'm sure there were just a few things I wasnt doing right but hell if I know what they were.  the game looks incredibly detailed though and I bet its really good and would have been really cool to get into back then, although it might have been pretty overwhelming for me as a kid, but if I had stuck with it I would have known way more about airplanes and jet fighters.  
* Assassin (9/25/19) This is not the special edition.  it looks like it was made by the exact same team.  Its funny but actually really cool how some of these Team17 games had special editions.  They weren't an edition of the game, they were a totally and completely different game using the same assets (mostly) and engine (mostly).  The 'hero's sprite looks so lifeless and ineffectual.  Its good that they changed him up for the SE.  Its pretty terrible.  If you get caught by a dog it just eats you for 10s while you die and theres nothing you can do to get away.  I tried it twice and got further each time.  What is the continue structure like after the first level?  Probably shit.  I've tried a third time.  Now I'm going to try a fourth to beat the first level.  Also I only got this far because I found a mouth which gives you verbal hints about what to do.  No I died on a dog again and I give up for now.  Grrr.  I bet with practice I could beat the first level but what then!?!
* Breach (9/25/19) Omnitrend Software, Inc. This is one of the confessions of an amiga addict games.  Even he says he cant stay alive to beat the end levels but he loves it anyway.  its really cool that its got a scenario editor so you can make new cool scenarios.  I think its cool that it keeps your squad leader who rpg levels up.  I couldn't even figure out how to end the turn and get more moves.  Maybe that never happens?  I was pretty confused.  I did kill one soldier at least and moved some dudes around and picked up and threw a grenade.  This was an early mouse game for the Amiga and its clear that devs were just getting the hang of making UIs and games with it and this is a solid effort with a lot of work gone into the back end scenarios and strategies.  this is not my style so much but I'm impressed for when it was released and I bet it could be really cool for some people.  
* Crystal Hammer (9/25/19) this games intro music has the same place in my heart as the song from the game Amegas does.  Its so wonderful for me to listen to this.  I must have listened to it 100 times back then out of big stereo speakers!  So this game is ok.  Theres nothing wrong with it and its got great graphics.  I like Megaball better tahn this or arkanoid or amegas, but they are all fun in their own way.  The mouse is a perfect tool for this kind of game and when breakout came out in the 70s arcades there wasnt really any mice to speak of so this is just the perfect evolution.  I love the gems in this game the look is fantastic.  the sounds and powerups are just fine.
* Obliterator (9/25/19) I owned this game but didnt get very far.  I remember really liking some of the first few screens but I didnt know how to proceed.  Apparently this is akin to the psygnosis barbarian games.  its way more responsive than those games.   The music is so kick ass!  I can't figure out how to get off the first screen!?!  Oh!?! You can click where you want him to move to.  Maybe you could do that in barbarian too?  You know thats not working anymore, but the mouse control does help and I think with a combination of mouse and keyboard (especially aiming the gun with the mouse) this could be pretty controllable.  No I mean the way this is setup I dont think its really very workable for me.  I would have to spend a lot of time with it to get it feeling like it really controlled properly like I had any real control over what was going on in the game.  I didn't feel like I had any control.  he was running when I didnt want him to and that meant he would run into the next room where there were enemies and I had to react quickly and dodge and then maybe shoot them but every room would require you to learn a strategy of how to beat that room and what to do there.  Worst part is with these kind of super imprecise controls you would stand in front of an elevator and not have any time to waste because you were about to get fired at and you knew it and it wouldnt let you kill that gun, so you have to get in the elevator but because you are 2 pixels off to the right it wont let you in so you have to turn around which takes a half hour and then take one step which inevitably means 6 steps and then turnaround again to try to get back to almost where you were and go up in the elevator again.  There are probably ways to master the controls but what a mess. it was a very early game so I give it a break but I would actually love to play it if it had contra controls and a bit different room/level design.  The graphics and music are pretty great. it could be really really cool.  
* Cybernetix (9/25/19) One of my favorite games of all time with one of my favorite (if not my number one) soundtracks.  I had the shareware version and I regret not spending some of my hard earned cash to register it back in the day.  I would love to beat this or get much further than I ever did as a kid.  I believe as a kid I got to the first boss once or twice, but thats because I didnt read enough about what you are supposed to do.  I got to hear the high score song from just getting to level 3!!!
* Captain Blood (9/25/19) I always wanted to play this and get way into it.  I was always attracted to it. Oh damn that rotating plant is amazing looking!  This is an amiga for gods sakes!!!  Thats in game graphics!?!  Plus tons of voice samples!  Ooh I went into hyperspace!!! Its got such cool blitter effects!  I am really good at this game! and wowanother rotating planet!  and wow the 3d lines of the planets mountains are amazing.  WHOA its rendering them as I fly!!! Well I'm pretty amazed and I think I would have been fascinated by the flying as a kid.  I have no idea what to do now and Im not motivated to learn but boy was this a cool and unique and interesting game!
* Carrier Command - Rainbird (9/25/19) I owned this game and actually sunk some time into it.  I remember the first time I played it I sucked so royally and didnt understand it in any way.  Good news is you can actually save your game!  Wow this has some fancy music on the title screen!?! I never had that!  it doesnt even sound like a mod if you ask me.  The dragging and dropping to arm your vehicles is so dramatically intuitive that you might not even think to do it and might wonder how to arm them!?!  I saw someone beat this in just 15 min or so and I would love to do something like that.  Many of the features are so immersive about this game and work so flawlessly and instantly that I love it so much.   Well my walrus got destroyed.  I could if I want to come back to this with the strategies from the youtuber and see what else I could do. I could play with taking islands but the crappy part is if you just play with it and dont get aggressive and do really well then the AI opponent will kick your ass but still thats a good way to learn.  What a great game.
* Cool Spot - Virgin (9/25/19) I remember liking this on NES or NES or something, I certainly liked the SPOT game which was reversi, but this game I remember making a tiny bit of progress in which was always heartening.  Lets see how I do in 2019!  Well the jumping controls just fine but enemies is completely illogical.  Its impossible to tell who is hitting you and why and impossible to stop them!?!  Tip for level designers.  dont put enemies in places that the player cant shoot them.  Best example: Enemies below you on a downward slope if the player cant shoot down and forward and at exactly the correct angle.  this isnt terrible nor is it interesting.  its a much better game than say that shitty bart simpson port.  the controls are good. The music is good.  No real complaints.  I beat level 1!
* The adventures of Willy Beamish (9/25/19) I'll never forget that I wanted to play this when a bunch of people from the Commodore Users group were trying to beat it together including Dallas.  I do not like these kinds of games but I like the idea of them.  lets see if I can get anywhere and solve even the most basic of the puzzles? Wow the game is so beautifully hand illustrated!  WOW!  Oh it loosk like you can save your game anytime!?! Cute he wants to go to the Nintari championships this summer.  Whoa the nurse is sexy!  Its clearly a good game though not my style. I got shots and it was game over for me but I feel like I did pretty good honestly.  It would be cool to see the whole game and maybe even walkthrough it if I were more motivated.  Maybe some other adventure Ill do that even though I dont typically like them.
* Block Out (9/25/19) This is truly incredible 3d math they did for this game.  The controls are perfect for the 80s.  mouse and keyboard or just keyboard two hands.  I'm very impressed.  Also After playing for 10 min I'm totally bored.  Very good game though and if I was looking for a way to spend time with a puzzling game that would be a great choice.
* Alien Breed Tower Assault (9/25/19) Team 17 this is supposed to be the best of them in part because its the only one thats remotely fair.  There is a mission code that you can enter.  I like that the narrative seems to give you options on which way to go.  The first level was 1/4 as brutal as alien breed 2 but it twas still hard.  Something I realized: these games require exploration and learning the map and they occasionally reward it with treasures but they consistently punish exploration with relentless respawning enemies but not respawning ammo.  Just that in and of itself means to explore an area you will encounter an enemy many times but the ammo to kill them only once (if theres even enough to kill all of the enemies).  its a disconnect that I cant seem to appreciate.  With this one the enemy presence was much less relentless at least on the first few levels so I feel like it could be a more laid back experience than the others.  They all just get under my skin but they are supposed to be SO GOOD!?!  
* Cannon Fodder 2 1994 Sensible Software (9/25/19) The intro music is so heavily sampled I dont know how they fit it on one disk.  Oh they didnt!?! They had a disk just for that song :)  This one is a lot harder from the first moment it starts.  I don't think I like that.
* Fantasy World Dizzy (9/26/19) This is considered the best dizzy game.  Well its kind of like the other one but I like the fantasy setting, and if I wanted a cutesy puzzle platformer this would work well.  I like its straightforward nature and I think more games should have been like this and its cool that you can keep just 2 things and use them later that constrains the puzzles in a good way.  I kept dying from jumps that were too tight and it didnt give enough mercy.  I dont like that and am not motivated to play anymore.  It was cool for a few minutes though.
* Flashback Delphine (9/26/19) The trainer has a level select in it which may help with the continue structure.  Then again this has a password system so maybe its ok.  I was under the impression this was closely related to another world, but I think the only similarity might be the animation style (and maybe the animation technology) but this one clearly heavily uses sprites.  Looks like the intro and probably the background is a similar tech.  They were both published by delphine.  The controls are a bit tricky and slow but not bad.  theyre a lot like another world.  I like the climbing actually but I feel like the gun could get tricky to control quickly.  Trying to follow the walkthrough doesnt make any sense.  I cant even do the first few steps right and I'm unmotivated.  
* Double Dragon (9/26/19) Double Dragon.  OMG the intro music is so terrible.  I have a feeling they sampled a few short clips form the arcade machine music and put it in super lo fi in mono in the left ear.  Its absolutely terrible and when you know the actual music you know its not timed right.  THe graphcs on the title screen arent bad.  The cahracter graphics are just horrible. The backgrounds are colorful but childish.  oh god.  The animation is terrible.  The fighting is terrible.  The sound is terrible (one sound that only applies sometimes) theres not many people on screen at once.  This might be the worst serious port Ive ever seen.
* Double Dribble Konami (9/26/19) Cool intro screen voices.  Bad intro screen looping.  I remember this on NES being the coolest basketball or sports game of any kind in the late 80s.  Tecmo Bowl, Ice Hockey NES, and Bases Loaded were close runners up. The slam dunk cutscenes are pretty bad ass tbh.  Hey I made a basket!  Lets see if I can slam dunk.  DUNK!!! Also the backboard shifted just a bit to make it more realistic.  Nice touch konami.  this is a fine game and a fine port.  Totally playable.  And it says you can play versus.  Not bad.
* Deja Vu (9/26/19)- A nightmare comes true.  WHDLoad didnt run.
* Dragons Lair and Escape Slow (9/26/19)(I dont know what the slow meant).  I suspect this wont be very fun because of the load times but lets find out.  Oh wow you can save your game in this game!  5 different profiles even.  Wow though the graphics and animations are SO GREAT for the computer they were on.  This would have felt a lot like the coinop.  Well I cant get it to respond to any of my commands so I give up.  It looks like the continue structure had promise on this game although if your saved game saved your lives with it then it would get pretty annoying to constantly reload.  On really cool thing is when you set it to the mode I had it on, you get hints!  It tells you what to do!
* Dune -(9/26/19) Wow amazing animated intro.  Truly amazing.  Movie like.   Wow it had blitter blur effect to make a ripple of water in a beaiutiful lake.  Its got all the likenesses from the movie.  I never played this as a kid but I remember emulating it in college, but I think I played the genesis version.  wow I dont like point and click adventures but this just drew me in.  I love this universe and this nails it.  The music is fantastic too. It sounds so modern.  Its so cool how you travel.  The scrolling is great and feels like youre in a movie.  I'm really impressed.  Its not stumping me too much but its letting me figure out what to do next.  As you fly travel it shows your location on a mini map indiana jones style.  And your destination actually shows up on the ground.  This is a game that is faithful to the story and the movie.  Most movie games arent at all.  You can skip the travel if you want which is a really nice touch.  They dont try to mess things up with lots of fx especially no speech.  All speech is through text boxes which works perfectly with the music playing in the background. Its fun seeing how far I can get without much resistance.  I spent about 30 min and got some prospectors to start looking for spice.  This is a great game!  YOu can look at the mirror and save your game once you get to this point.  I did that.  
* Final Fight - Capcom (9/26/19)  I love that they have a control demonstration first thing when loading the game.  No music or sound?  Hey the sprites look spectacular!  Theyre huge and detailed and even though they look washed out in color they are recognizable and cool!  The fighting sucks.  THey really blew it on this.  It could have been so great but the hitboxes and enemy AI is broken so you just get ganged up on and spammed to death over and over.  There might be strategies to play the game and actually make progress but if so they aren't fun beat em up strategies.  Theres certainly no way to go feeling like youre kicking ass and cleaning up the streets.  That was the 512k version.  Lets see about the 1mb version.  Ah music!  Up and fire jumps left and right and fire kicks, firea lone punches, fire and down is special move.  They compensate for the shitty fighting mechanics by making the enemies die easily.  if you can get al enemies on one side you can take less damage by spamming punch. If you get stuck between enemies then the only way out is when you become invincible after you die.  So the only difference I can see between 512 and 1mb version (its not graphics) is theres intro music.  Well this is pretty shitty but whats striking is how much better this is than double dragon in every way.  I would have been SO SAD if I had bought double dragon for my amiga thinking I was getting the NES game with better graphics.  
* Emerald Mine 1987 Kingsoft (9/26/19) The text is awesome.  The in game graphics are ... childish and C64 level.   But its real playable and the continue structure is fantastic and 20 years ahead of its time.  In this game you can have multiple players and each one is saved on a certain level so you can continue on that level.   What a great game.  Part of the reason people liked this game so much is just how continuable it is.  You can make legitimate progress every day.  that makes it vastly more casual.  I beat level 1.  oh and yay its got multiple exits from each room which makes it so much more interesting!  That means replay value!!! Ok I beat level 0 and level 1.   Now I'm on level 2.  What a great game!
* Duck Tales the quest for gold (9/26/19) Hmm the theme song is there but its slightly 'off' and so much better on NES.  I think it was a timing thing. The intro graphics are WONDERFUL!  3 difficulty levels is a good sign.  The music in the loading screen is a good subdued version of the theme.  oh no.  Dont tell me this isnt like the NES game???  This isnt a loading screen this is some kind of menu screen.  Ok the pilot has voiceover!  Oh no is it goign to make me play the game while we fly?  yes it is.  And I crashed and now I have to wait 2 days to fix the plane.  wtf.  Its kind of got lots of voiceovers.  Ok now I'm huey and I'm swinging a rope and cant figure out how to shoot it.  This sucks. 
* Face Off Hockey (9/26/19) This feels like 4th and inches as one of the best computer hockey games according to the mags.  Cool intro graphics and music I like the graphics and the scrolling and size of the rink.  Well although I'm losing 0-6 I feel like I'm doing ok for a first time.  Most of his goals have been back to back because I can't figure out who I am controlling.  No matter how much I hit them in a fight I get the penalty.  I have no idea how to pass except to the other team.  I am just hoping I can score one goal.  Probably not tbh.  I didnt score at all.  But thats a pretty darn good hockey game imho.
* Elite (9/26/19) Well this is a classic.  The graphics are absolutely amazing. I love the shaded look like that.   its fast and snappy and the menus are too.  You can look in many different directions since its 3d.  I dont have anything installed so I cant shoot missiles or go fast. Well I blowed up into a planet I guess?  I didnt get anywhere but it was really cool and I can see the potential!    
* Flight Simulator 2 (9/26/19) This was way too complicated.  I couldn't not crash. 
* Dark castle by three-sixty (9/26/19) oooh its in stereo! Ok well the graphics were shit but as dark castles go it was probably ok.  It didnt look anywhere as bad as the Genesis one.  
* Fast Break (9/26/19) 1989 Accolade.  I always thought this would be an amazing game and the magazines really talked it up.  I couldn't even figure out how to do a throw in.  The joystick didnt work and the qweadzxc were the directions but thats all I could get.
* Die Hard 2 (9/26/19) Grandslam Cool title music.  Its a floaty mouse based light gun game.  I hated it.  No fun at all.  they said "BOy did you ever screw this one up.  One of the worst scores ever.  Enter your name for police records.
* Dangerous Streets AGA (9/26/19) Micromania software.  This is apparently terrible.  lets find out if its worse than body blows or capital punishment.  yeah its worse but really the fighting is the same.  This one is worse because the animation is so much worse.  The character art is terrible as these go (to be clear I couldn't make art like that) but there are no intermediate frames of animation or any attempt at something like that.  Its so jerky.  The fighting is still horrible.  OMG int he intro song there is a low fi voice sample thats supposed to sound all tough! Ok I won one round as lola vs tony and thats enough for me to say that hte fightnig enemy ai is actually slightly better than the other two in some ways. 
* Donkey Kong by Bignomia (9/26/19) This is the same company that did Aztec Challenge.  it seems like a great port of the C64 version and thats a godo thinga nd apparently it has an extra original level! 
* Dr Mario (9/26/19) Dr Mario - WHOA This isnt nintendo dr mario this is by werner and rohrich.  Oh its public domain so feel free to copy is what they say.  Its actually really smooth playing and with great graphics.  Its got some questionably atypical heavy metal music which doesnt fit and is kind of grating but its great and two players head to head too with joystick vs keyboard.  Nice work!
* Donk the Samurai Duck - 1993 by the Hidden (9/26/19) Nice title cards.  On intersting thing here is you select normal mode or AGA mode from within the game.  Its an average or below average platformer with a great large main character sprite and quick deaths.  I'm proud of myself for beating the first level.  Man AGA Blitter gradients from black to bright blue are gorgeous!  One cool thing is that it has an overworld map.  I dont like this overall though.   Its a jewel collectathon but the jewels have tiny hitboxes.  Theres nothing terribly wrong with this.
* Defender by Ratsoft Giles F McArdell (Shareware) 1994 (9/26/19) he was waiting for a good defender clone for the amiga but couldnt find one so he wrote one in assembler. The most arcade accurate on any home computer at the time says he (and it sounds like it was a labor of love to get it right so he might be right).  Wow yeah its really good.  It doesnt save your high scores in the WHDLoad.
* Dick Tracy (9/26/19) This is some kind of terrible run and gun with horrible controls and its like slow animation sped up really fast.  This is the kind of thing I could have fallen for back then.
* Flintstones (9/26/19) 1988 Cute synth flintstones theme on the title screen - oh its by Benn Daglish.   Its got great cartoon graphics, but it wants you to paint a wall while pebles is painting it dirty wiht her name.  I couldn't figure out how to get paint on the brush.  Thats not fun.
* Disposable Hero (9/26/19) Gremlin I remember thinking that this looked so beautiful.  I dont even remember what it looked like though :) Ok lets try this again wiht a slower emulator.  This sure is an amazing looking side scrolling shooter.  Easy mode is broken because it only goes 3 levels in. That means the continue system is broken on this game. Wow this is good though.  I fixed it with the slower emulator and its really really good shooter.  1. Its got a life bar not just one hit deaths (although hitting the walls is one hit).  its so beautiful and I love the graphics so much.  and its not so hard that I cant get anyhwhere.  I got past at least 2 checkpoints to a pretty apparently powerful boss and got 57600.  AND it saves your high scores!!!
* Flying Shark (9/26/19) Firebird and Taito.  the pixel art is great actually its really clear and sharp and I love it.  The background scrolling is herky jerky and hurts your eyes and ruins the game.  
* First Samurai 1991 Vivid Image Image Works (9/26/19) epic intro George Takei!   Great intro with a cool story!  Wow I love how the character moves.  I love the controls and the martial arts he can do.  Music and FX.  I dont understand the controls yet but its really cool the stuff he cand do.  He can even grab walls and when he gets the sword hes a bad ass throwing knives and shit. I just got a little potion powerup which isntead of helping me sent me back to the beginning of teh damn level!  I dont think the enemy ai or combat design is any good.  Why dont one hit kill most enemies?  It would be much fun that way, why do they constantly respawn even behind you?  well its a really cool game that reminds me of myth, leander, gods, assassin.
* Flimbos Quest 1990 system 3 (9/26/19) Infinite lives and money trainer.  One hit deaths cutesey great graphics.  Stupid enemies that come at you when you have a super weak and pathetic attack.  
* ESWAT (9/26/19) Cool Robocop intro!  Its a shitty arcade port of a run and gun game.  
* Deuteros The next milennium Activision (9/26/19)  Did I have this?  Maybe so but I got no further back then.  This is some kind of cool smoky future strategy or simulation game.  dirty science fiction setting.
* Dr Dooms Revenge 2 disk version (9/26/19) This is a super shitty superhero game.  The scrolling is so awful its embarassing for the amiga.  It looks like c64 or worse.  Its more colorful than c64 but geez.  It spidey and cap and the comic book tiles are cool. oh god its some kind of terrible fighting game boss rush game.  the fighting made no sense the controls were totally counterintuitive.  the hits didnt ever register the movement was way behind my controls.  ugh.
* FA18 Interceptor - EA and Intellisoft (9/26/19) Great intro music!  WHAT?  You can fly an F-16 in this??? Sweet!!! Wow I love how it zooms in on the plane from space that was dramatic and great.  Oh wow with a simple set of keyboard controls this game is totally playable and fun.  I love this!! New favorite flight sim ever!
* Firepower - 1987 (9/26/19) its a tank game, which made me think of combat, but the controls are not at all the same, theyre excellent and probably better but really just totally different tahn combat.  Its not tank vs tank in the one player mode but you have to go destroy a bunch of enemy guns.  The tanks look amazing and the control is excellent. I didn't love it though because of how the enemies shot at you didnt feel fun or fair.  One cool thing is you can play over a modem!
* Deluxe Galaga - Edgar Vigdal - (9/26/19)  Wow there are lots of cheats built into the game like unlimited cash and also mouse control and also how to save your high scores (in game or on exit?)  I dont know how to save my high scores in game.  Mouse doesnt work as well as I thought it would.  It doesnt track at full speed its super slow so its precise but ... I dont know.  Also it messes up all of the menus.
* Deluxe Galaga AGA -(9/26/19)   Edgar Vigdal - I was wrong there arent cheats built in thats not unlimited cash it no limit to the amount you can collect orgamically.  anyway this is a great game.  Ok you have to use esc to save your high scores.  Lets see if that works.  If you push down arrow on title screen you get to an options screen.  In this game you can select music or fx but you can do that per channel.  thats bad ass!  oooh this has hot seat co op! One cool thing Ive never seen in another game: You can print your high score tables!  BASTARD STOLE ALL MY CASH!!!!  I didnt miss shooting him as fast as I could but with the 3way that wasnt enough Damn!  This is a great game where you can play for 5-10 min without dying too much.  I love it.  One of the best.  I'm on Level 13!  I just bought extra speed which should make a big difference.  422190! Confirmed that it saves your high scores as long as you escape out of it to quit.
* Deluxe PacMan - Edgar Vigdal -(9/26/19)   Shareware.  I should have bought this back in the day.  I loved the graphics so much and I thought it was so beautiful and so much fun.  You know what ... he sampled the death sound low fi from the arcade!  45190 high score!  Lets see if it saves. Unfortunately no it doesnt save high scores.
* Deluxe Pacman AGA - Edgar Vigdal - Shareware - Maybe this version saves high scores?  73500 high score on level 8!!!  I think the ecs pacman sprite looks a bit cleaner.  
* Football Manager 2 - (9/26/19)  1988 Addictive Software - This game was really highly regarded.  Lets see how this goes.  Well I coulndt get a match going.  There was probably something else I needed to do but fire to quit didnt work.  
* Football Manager World Cup Edition - (9/26/19)  its cool that it keeps track of morale and you give them locker room speeches.  Wow you can zoom in on the action!  Graphics are pretty great.  A little choppy scrolling but thats ok.  it got boring watching them play.  Really cool game though.
* Falcon - (9/26/19)  This was one of the first games to really blow my mind with its graphics.  It was the shot of the cockpit that did it.  Whiel youre loading up the plane its cool to see the flightline that I'm so familiar with.  The controls werent too complicated and I got to see the beautiful graphics Ive always loved.  They fitted my weapons for me before I left.  w for wheel brakes  +/- for throttle until its strong, / for afterburner, <> for increase or decrease it.  return for air to air backspace for air to ground space for trigger 3456 for cockpit views 7890 for out of cockpit views.  t for air target select.  I took off but didnt land.  F for flaps.  Thats a good game. 
* Formula One Grand Prix - Microprose (9/26/19) This is the racing game everyone loved so much The building and painting car intro is pretty bad ass with a great score.  The presentation of this game is tremendous.  The graphics are great!!!  I couldn't do any good but this is honestly a great game from the first race you know it.  The controls are perfect. I always thought that it was just one people had setteled on and thats why they liked it no this is fantastic control not too slick not too out of control doesnt spin out, but rewards good following of the lines (it seems).  Nice work!  
* Dungeon Master - (9/27/19) I like that its straightfoward: Enter, Resume, Quit.  Its got saved games on a save game disk in DF1.  Great simple graphics and numpad controls.  Its cool that you setup your party ingame by resurrecting from a picture on the wall.  Its weird that running into walls forward hurts you.  It only hurts the people on that side.  Its so immersive its like VR from back then and I bet it felt like that for some people.  You feed your character by dragging food onto their mouths.  The first level where you pick your team is all about getting used to the controls.  This is really really cool.  Oh wow its got tabs for the players.  Tabs aren't something I remember until browsers in the late 90s! Clearly they predated that probably in office software or something but thats still really forward thinking.  You can format a floppy in game to save your game.  Lets try it out.  Well I didnt even have to format it when I made it in UAE.  The graphics are all totally functional and the GUI is reminiscent of WB 1.3 graphics.  The dungeon graphics are great the other graphics arent great but totally work and do plenty to draw you in to the world of the imagination. Interesting that you have to pick up all of their gear.  Its realistic that way and brutal.  I beat a mummy, two characters died but I resurrected them!  Great game.  Load from disk worked perfectly!  I wish I had bought this back in the day.  I bet I would have liked it very much.  Its more my style than BT3 and I might have been able to figure some of it out actually.
* Dragons Lair 2 Timewarp (9/27/19) Well unless I'm missing something the continue structure is broken as you would expect, but actually it had a promising feature: it let you continue from the screen you were last on.  I guess thats not new.  The screen I was on was 10 seconds into the game and I couldn't figure out what to do.  Theres no good reason for them to have not given you unlimited continues on this game.  They were probably afraid people would figure it out and go raid the arcades on one quarter.  Well yeah but they just paid  you $50 to be able to do play it all they wanted!?!  geez.  I would have spent some time with it but would have also been really disappointed if I had actually bought these games back in the day.  I would have felt dumb because I wouldn't have known what to do or why I couldn't get anywere.
* Dragons Lair 3 The Curse of Mordred (9/27/19) I couldn't even figure out how to make the first move.  in the first game they at least focused on the character from one camera angle.  in this one I'm expected to move in some direction or do something an instant after the camera angle switches for me to see my character from a new direction that Ive never seen him from.  Its like it isn't even polite enough to give you the dignity to be theoretically able to make the decision in time to not die the first time you encounter it. 
* Dungeon Master 2 AGA Interplay (9/27/19) Its checking memory requirements.  I hope I have enough because if I dont I might have to go buy more for $100/MB (yeah thats a real number my dad paid in 1992).  Ok this has better UI graphics with a 3d look.  Cool cave details wiht animated dripping water.  Notably its not as obvious where the side passages are with these cave details.  In the previous game the dungeon wall edges were crisp and clear.  Sweet!  This lets you save the game to hard disk!!!  Well its blacking out.  Lets see if it works.  Yeah it flashed a bunch but worked!  There are some cool beasts you can recruit onto your team this time.  The graphics look good and better than before but not AGA imho.  I like how you resurrect in this game and the previous.  I dont know how to get into or unlock the main dungeon but thats enough for now.  Its great!
* Defender of the Crown 1986 Cinemaware (9/28/19) Wow the art on the shimmering bronze title screen is amazing!  All the graphics are so fantastic!  I'm raiding a castle!  Wish me luck!  No I was captured and must pay much gold to be released. Ok I built my army.  Wish me luck again!  The fight animations and backgrounds are really cool.  OK I actually built my army this time.  Shucks captured again. This time I raided a different castle. I still got caught and dont have nymoney.  This is a cool game.  Hey to the tournament we go!  Doh I lost in the joust! Oh no the last battle!  I join robin hoods merry men.  The end.  Cool game!
* Frontier Elite II 1993 Gametek and konami?  Wow!  The 3d in this is really cool and it would have been amazing to see this back then.  Wow its a whole 3d industrial city. and several enemy fighters attacking it!  this intro is epic!  Wow the starting city is epic too.  Well somebody blew me up in the city perhaps because I shot once but I requested leave to take off and paid my $600 fine!?!
* Fire & Ice - I beat this in 2017 with save states.  this is a good one.  This is the Uridium Author.  The continue structure is broken as is true with most games.   The title screen is pretty fantastic with its animation revealing different info and the beautiful water at the bottom.  Lets see if the CD32 version is any better.  Well it has a background on teh title screen but its also jittery.  the graphics dont look substantially better otherwise.  Its got some WHDLoad cheats built in.  No the whole screen and all of the backgrounds and enemies are jittery in this version.  No the backgrounds are better but thats the only difference to the graphics.  There were a lot of CD32 cash ins I guess.  Nothing inherently wrong with that but if they had put a bit more time into them ... I bet COmmodore told all of the publishers: Hey you can republish the same games and they will be on our new console!  You dont even have to change them.  You cant lose!
* Desert Strike EA - (9/28/19) I played this some on Genesis in the last few years, but originally I played and loved and beat a short demo of this game back in the day. Wow the text font they use here is wonderful, its clear and shiny.  cool intro music too.  Its got a cool story and cutscenes.  haha it animates the tyrant slapping his subordinate because the subordinate doesnt want his children to die.  Wow its got a WONDERFUL UI which has a really heavy feel to it like its a real military cockpit.  Oh theres a password in here.  I wonder what the continue structure is like?  this has a lot of cool cutscenes and exposition.  I'm impressed.  It really gets you into the game.  The graphics are fantastic.  Oh no the mouse controls are absolutely terrible.  mouse right to turn right doesnt work at all.  Good game.  I don't like the controls but thats ok and I think I could have gotten used to the joystick controls eventually.  
* Dune 2 - (9/28/19) I remember playing this in 1997 or so when starcraft was big and this was considered one of the first real time strategy games.  The graphics are great.  Ok theres some kind of load and save feature.  Cool graphics and speech!  I like that there are missions which you can replay.  It took me a whiel but I completed the first mission.  This is good stuff.  You know what game I always wanted to beat?  Warcraft 3.  I bought that when it came out and I think I even tried to play it (or did) in Linux.   This reminded me of that game.  Oh no dune 2 long play is from 5-9 hours!  Not too bad but probably more involved than I'm looking for.  Still thats definitely a great game.  haha for copy protection they claim they have reports I have been trading confidental information with the enemy and I have to answer a specific question about the troop structures (from the manual :) ) 
* Chaos Engine 2 (9/28/19) This is apparently a pretty weird game where you are always competing.  There is some kind of password system.  The music is weird and not that fun.  Its terrible.  I applaud their experimentation but it shouldn't be called 2 maybe Chaos Engine: Versus Battle or some clever name for that.  Its a totally and completely different game that happens to have similar shooting mechanics.
* Eye of the beholder Westwood 1990 (9/28/19) This is apparently one of the best Dungeon Master Clones.  Its an official AD&D product. "Begin your search below the city".  Nice I was able to load a game in progress!  I liked very much that a right click returned you out of the player menu in Dungeon Master.  This is 1 step clumsier in that way.  Graphics and sound are great though.  And this is one of the games where the continue structure really works because they let you save at any time.  I keep moving my hands over to WASD which would have been perfect here, but of course that was a long time ago before that paradigm.  Whats cool is this has the same basic controls as a modern FPS forward back, left right strafe, rotate left and right.  Back then I was pretty intimidated by the Gold Box games, and the Ultima and Wizardry series.  I felt like I could do Phantasie, Questron, or Bards Tale.  for some reason I felt like those were easier or mor accessible (not that I knew what any of those concepts really meant in these contexts) and even more accessible were Demons Winter, Faery Tale Adventure, Times of Lore and Legend of Blacksilver.  Those were my impressions and most of them were inaccurate.  I thought that Dungeon Master was a simple game which these clones had done much better (which was an incorrect impression because it was great and the clones were great too) and this game I thought was the pinnacle of complicated games that would take me 60-100 hours and which I would never ever win.  otoh I thought I should be able to beat Bards Tale 3 (which I thought was just like the first but just better and a different part of the same story which is kind of missing the point) and faery tale.  I never bought times of lore unfortunately.  anyway this one was the peak of complexity and that I would never be able to play it or get anywhere in it, and that I was too cool for it and wouldnt have fun even if I played it.  What i'm learning now is it was kind of the opposite.  If at least I had spent some time with it this one and all of the DM clones are more accessible than most of the others I listed above, and probably more beatable.  I would have had to learn some difficult rules and probably never would ahve beat it but I am sure I would have gotten further than I did in Bards Tale.  One thing about this is I cant tell instantly which one I hit its not utterly obvious where it could be with some extra visual cues.  Hey two of my players gained a level!  Hearing the hooves pouding on the ground is pretty creepy and awesome!  I know spells require you to memorize them and then you forget them or something.  I made it down one level into the dungeon!!!  Theres only one save game (which is fine).  When I look at the rulebook that came with it I get overwhelmed.  Thats a lot of stuff to keep track of that I don't personally care about or want to keep track of to do my dungeon crawling.  Thats a great game though.  I missed out on all of that and its a pity.
* Eye of the Beholder II 1992 (9/28/19) 6 slots to save your games is really nice luxury.  The party creation is actually really quick and simple.  oh no I'm in the woods with wolves!  Well I died quickly by attacking those people in Darkmoon.  Ive seen a lot of this game on a walkthrough and its really good (although some of the puzzles are super obscure and I wouldn't have been able to figure them out).  
* FIFA International Soccer (9/28/19) Holy shit ea sports its in the game sampled voice!  Great exciting techno title screen!  I'll bet that this is decent quality but nothing fun at all compared to kick off or sensi.  The menus are impossible to navigate.  OMG its got my mouse mapped as my joystick.  There were so many input problems I couldn't play it.  Is there something wrong with my joystick mapping now?  Nope.  Alien breed worked just fine.  
* Empire Strikes Back (9/28/19) Whoa Vector Graphics Star Wars!!!  thats actually pretty bad ass.  10857 I'm poroud of my spot 21 high score! The shooting is precise and the 3d is cool.  the getting hit is not precise but I bet one could get better at that over time.  I think thats a pretty cool game and if I had that back then I would have played it from time to time.  
* Double Dragon 2 (9/28/19) Cool intro screen. I owned this game but never got it working I think the disk was bad even though it was brand new and I didn't know how to get another (it was years later).  Wow this isn't a bad double dragon at all.  I am beating dudes up just fine and its pretty fun.  Its two players too so if I had this as a kid I would have liked it and played it quite a bit although I might not have gotten too terribly far but hey thats ok.  Thats good stuff!  The graphics are good too. 
* Faery Tale Adventure (9/28/19) I had so much fantasy with this game.  I got farther in this than some of the other games I had but I so terribly wanted to be good at this and go on an epic adventure quest but I never really got to. One thing is the continue structure of this game is pretty broken because you only get limited lives to do the whole enormous quest (which are the three brothers and luck for each) and so I was always so scared for one of them to die.  This is a really good game for the time. apparently written by one guy who crammed a freaking enormous map onto a little teensy floppy disk using patterns.  Oh oh I was slain by arrows.  Biggest complaint: Cant' see guys coming from off screen.  VR can fix that.  Hey!  With clever fighting and retreating pattnrn I killed one of those death guys!!!  Only after watching several walkthroughs of the first parts of this game do I even really understand what you are trying to do and this one is a pretty long list of things to do even when you know where they are and what to do, and even when you know the secrets that will keep you alive.  I remember from a video walkthrough that you kind of have to get a sword before you can expect to survive long and the only way to get one is to defeat a bunch of baddies with swords which you wont have a chance of doing unless you go to the graveyard.  I feel like thats going too far in expecting people to figure out how to even get a sword and that this is one of the only ways.  Finally got a Mace!  all that took like 45 minutes over two days.  Good game with great fantasy and a technical marvel.
* Indiana Jones and the Fate Of Atlantis - Action 1992 Lucasarts (9/28/19) The controls are so weird.  Wait no they're not weird if youve played resident evil!  It just took a few to figure that out.  The graphics are amazing and the enemy knockback when punched is a pretty great effect.    The fact that they can make an action game that works at all from this perspective is fantastic.  even them making an isometric perspective game like this with these graphics is fantastic. its really cool that they made two similar and related games but with totally different styles of play.  I'm impressed.  Hey I got 285 a high score!  
* Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis - Adventure 1992 Lucasarts (9/28/19) Totally different graphics, this one looks like Monkey Island.  the speech reminds me of it.  Oh wow this is a lot like a movie even having the credits over the gameplay at the beginning.  I remember thinking I could really get into the fantasy of this game or the other one and feel like I was really indiana jones.  His hat falls off and floats down when he falls over.  Very impressive animation details.  Its got a good sense of humor too because he keeps falling through ceilings.  This uses the SCUMM story system which might mean I could play this on a modern computer too with SCUMMVM.  Wow if there was ever a point and click I would want to play it would be this one.  Damn this is fantastic!!  I found the key/statue!  Conclusion:  I'm really good at these games! hes robbing me at gunpoint!  Damn you!  WOW amazing fight animation. Just like a movie.  its even got the airplane flying sounds!  Oh and I've got this amiga running at full speed on accident but it still works great!  Also theres game save at any time just push F1! (I asked myself "How would you setup a game save feature?"  and it worked!)
* Kick Off 2 (9/28/19) Wow the interface is totally fine but GOAL! was so much more pro.  what?  4 players?  How does that work??? The speed is fast but thats not because I'm emulating fast.   I just turned on a slower amiga and its the same blazing speed.  You know whats weird.  I've only played this for like 30 seconds or so and this is the game I should have gotten.  This is a better game than goal.  If you loved this game then goal was a great and natural progression but back then I honestly believed that the newer things would be better and by all rights they should be in many cases but thats not how the world or creativity works and I know that now. Back then I thought things like "well if everyone in the magazines loves kick off 2, and goal is the sequel by the same guy, then thats the one to get.  It will be better than kick off 2 and therefore I will have more fun than everyone in the magazines says they are having!"  Otoh I dont even know how to dribble in this game.  I thought I did but maybe I never did in goal either!?!  Well I don't have any real control over this and im down 0-3 and they have like 15 shots and I have 0 but I can feel its quality.  
* Hillsfar (9/28/19) This was always one of the most intimidating fantasy games for me but I really wanted to play it and get into the fantasy anyway.  OMG So Accessible!  The city has a live in game map!  That part is an amazing improvement over many of the other games of the day. Its also got a lock picking mini game that I couldn't figure out at all and random people can just offer to join your party.  And you can break into houses and sneak around for a certain time before you are noticed.  Thats a cool game.  
* Great Giana Sisters (9/28/19)  its just what I expected, but is it like super mario bros?  well no.  are there similarities? Of course in particular the enemy designs, and are there more similarities than there needs to be?  yes.  But its a shadow of mario.  the controls are floaty and nothing like mario) the responsiveness of the whole thing is lacking.  the level design is uninteresting. This did not give me any sense of fantasy like mario did.  I guess actually I expcted to like it more and I didn't.
* Globulus (9/29/19) This had a quirk when running in JIT mode (as fast as the amiga can on your host computer) it barely accepted inputs.  Hey this is a fascinating puzzle game!  Its qbert controls and basic game mechanics except the button flips the screen making pits into valleys and steep ramps up into steep ramps down!  This looks like its got a lot of levels too.  Well done!
* Gremlins 2 (9/29/19) 1990 Cool gizmo animated intro screen.  well its a platform game where you are a guy in a tie with a phat lazer beam!  its got good graphics.  On the second screen 10s into the game you can't beat it.  9 or so lives one hit kills a guy comes from the right lazer doesnt kill him and simultaneously a guy comes from the left whehn you try to dodge the guy on the right.  Terrible enemy placement/level design.  THe graphics were good though and the control seemed fine at first.  
* Heimdall (9/29/19) Core Design  This is really cool intro video and music and animation!  There is some kidn of saved game in this.  Is this an RPG?  You pick 4 characters.   Well its isometric but simple straightforward controls and pickups.   Yeah its basically an RPG.  The battles zoom in and are first person slightly like eotb where you select a person to be in front (take damage and give damage) and then what weapon they want to use and when to strike and it might be blocked by the opponent or not. Its pretty cool and accessible, although one of my characters died on the first battle.  Well I'm stuck on the 3rd screen.  Cool game!
* Heimdall 2 (9/29/19) Core Design.  Localized!  This one is totally different.  Theres no party selection just you and a woman.  Theres no intro.  The controls are rotated a bit (its comfortable)  I can barely figure out what to do.  It looks like you can switch players at any time.  Theres a rune list and spells and manual and a hints that comes with the WHDLoad. 
* Heimdall 2 AGA (9/29/19) Core Design.    The only difference I can see is the backgrounds.  The sprites are a tad bit more colorful.  Loading times between screens and players are a bit long but thats with hard drive, imagine on floppy omg.  
* Hero Quest 2 (9/29/19) Cool Pixel art.  It reminds me of NES but more crisp.  It sounds like you have to dungeon crawl and find certain artifacts.  Ok its isometric point and click controls.   There does seem to be some kind of hard to read in game map. Some of these old Amiga GUIs were interesting but since there were few standards back then its sometimes hard to figure out how to even get back to the previous menu.  I'm totally stuck unfortunatley and no amoutn of clicking can make me do anything.  I give up but I wish I had been able to see how combat worked.  
* Hero Quest (9/29/19) Gremlin.  1992 Hasbro.  I think this is based on the board game.  Cool animated intro with great pixel art.  I accidentally picked the hardest level d'oh!  the music is good, the battles are turn based and probably like the board game based on dice rolls.  I dont like it but I imagine anyone who liekd the board game would have loved it.  It looks well done.
* The Games: Summer Edition - EPYX (9/29/19) Lets try archery.  Graphics are ok if from a weird perspective.  I like this!  It was well done.  I like that its got an enormous multi panel early LCD color display in a stadium.  On the uneven parallel bars I had absolutely no idea what I was doing but I did a bunch of stuff that looked cool and then got a score.  I couldn't tell whether it was a demo or not.  Pole Vault got painful.  Its a pretty fun set of mini games.  
* Journey. (9/29/19) This infocom game had a screenshot in a magazine which I always thought looked absolutely amazing and made me want to play it.  I think I really wanted to be in a fantasy world.  I didnt realize until later that this was infocom.  Marc Blank.  1988.  I like how this works it shows you what you can do every step  Its not like n s e w its just turn based options and its really relaxing this way.  and theres even a back button.  ... oh wow I love this way of telling the story.  i love it so much!  I always had a good feeling about this game.  I'm well aware it may introduce a bunch of bullshit puzzles later that I cant solve but I like it so far and I love the way it works.  I had fun going into a store and buying a map.  I love it!  And its got game save! WHDLoad:JourneySave1 is my save game.
* Gloom AGA by Black Magic 1995 (9/29/19) The title music is weird.  I never thought much of this because it looked so clearly to be a clone but I know now that clones can be amazing!  Whoa its got two player mode? And remote link options?  Programmed by mark Sibly, I recognized that name from somewhere and found out he is the founder of Blitz Research which has made Amiga like game engines for PC since 5 years after this game came out.  He knew his shit even back then!  Graphics loadings creen are pretty crappy.  Background is one sentence "Simple Stuff! Watch out for ambushes though ..."  Well the introductory design is terrible because they dont give you any space to get used to the controls before being attacked by three dudes. THe graphics are ok.  I'm playing on a double speed 68020.  The pixels are huge but things are reasonably clear when close up. I couldn't even figure out how to shoot.  You can turn off the floor or ceiling (which are textured) to speed it up.  Ok its the windows key and now that I can shoot I like the shooting and the gibs.  Its pretty fun!  Sidestep is alt arrow but it should be its own key.  Theres apparently cd32 gamepad option with shoulder strafe which might work and I'll try that next.  Hey even with the keyboard this isnt bad at all.  In fact its quite fun!  I have played a lot of FPSs by now so I don't know if I would have had so much fun with it back in the day but now yeah I think its great!  heres the next classic dialogue: "Stay Alert!  Watch out for Aggro Skinheads!" Framerate is good!  I dont see any continue structure at all, but I beat the first level!  This is good stuff.
* Hook Ocean (9/29/19)  Great intro music (bells! it sounds just like a movie score) and cool intro cutscene!  I remember watching a longplay of this a few years ago and remember the puzzles being illogical to my head so I suspect it will be like Monkey Island which is a good thing for the quality in general, but for my tastes it doesnt stand a chance.  I loved this movie back in the day which had so much great fantasy in it.  At first he was walking around reasonably but now hes stuck and I cant get him to move anywhere or get anyone to talk.  The graphics are beautiful.  Ok she says you'll get nowhere dressed like that so you need to get different clothes.  I saw a shirt hanging to the left of the city, and she will sell the hat if I can get some money.  Those puzzles are logical.  Beautiful game.  I wonder how it was rated bitd.  Well it was rated pretty good even if not everybody liked it. They said since tehre were a limited set of things you could do that it was more oriented for younger kids than monkey island and that makes sense.    That makes me think I might actually be able to beat this someday if I wanted.    They said that it was enjoyable with unforgettable tunes and smooth animation eeven if its short (thats what I like!).  With that said I'd probably do monkey island first because of my memories with it specifically :) 
* John Madden Football (9/30/19) EA 1992 Fancy TV Ad style EA Sports Network intro.  Cool speech intro!  Heavy Metal title screen!  Its a cool interface.  John Madden looks young here.  Whoa its pseudo 3d like racing games 3d! the graphics are good the action is a bit slow but probably realistic.  I bet this looked freaking amazing in 1992.  I couldnt figure out the controls and ui for the play calling. 
* Jungle Strike 1994 Ocean (9/30/19) Produced under license from EA its got really cool cutscene at the beginning like a movie!  Theres a picture of Sadaam Hussein and it says "he looks ugly but familiar"!  So it starts at the white house and its pretty cool that you get to choose a co pilot.  Oh SWEET!  It automatically picks up that I have a two button joystick!  This is going to be so much better.  The sprite rotation of the chopper is fantastic and is one of the things that made this game look so amazing bitd.  Damn the map is huge!  I ran out of fuel and died without having aseen any enemies.  WEll I cant figure out what to do but I really like this.   I killed a civilian vehicle!?!  
* Kick Off 1989 (9/30/19) The UI is awesome on a huge LED Display.  In this one the first thing you can do is practice skills.  Thats something amazing that I never got to do really.  I wonder if GoAL had something like that?  I could have always started with 2p but in either case I woudln't know what to practice really.  The control is so great on these games that even if you don't know what you are doing its fun just kicking it around.  Its a really nice touch how it rolls up the side walls and back down.  Its wonderful.  
* Kick off 2 + World Cup (9/30/19) I think this is kick off 2 with the world cup teams which would have been a dream come true bitd.  I had to hit F10 or * to play it.  its got save and load if you play the world cup.  You can record games or events and replay them which you could do in GOAL as well.  This game has dots on the ball which the first game didn't.  I didn't see anything wrong with this
* Kick off 3 (9/30/19) by steve screech (not dino dini) omg the pointer is the same as in GOAL, but its too slow and it doesnt roll and it doesnt look as good and it doesnt work with the mouse!  this is not a good sign. Well its fine.  The characters are bigger which means they are more detailed but also wonkier in the way that faery tale adventure characters are wonky because of pixels and weird perspectives.  and since its zoomed in you cant see as much of the pitch for context which is where kick off got it right (and arguably sensi got it even more right).  It was slow to play compared to kick off.  It was easy to trap the ball in thsi game and it might play just fine but I can see why no one gave it much of a chance, and I can see why kick off 2 fans would have been sorely disappointed.  sorely. 
* Kid Gloves (9/30/19) Well after a while fireballs come down and kill you.  I used to think I would really like this as a kid but seeing the first screen in action I dont think I'm going to.  The way they split the screen to show you text is pretty cool and technically amazing although its also kind of abrupt.  Ok its not so bad.  Its a screen based platformer which while quaint is actually decently workable continue structure. It has a lot fo lifes but thats not going to be enough.  And there are a lot of things you have to learn by dying.  The collision of the platforms issnt quite right and its all kind of low tech but it really isnt bad at all.  I'm going to try it again.  I know it reminds me of a graphically enhanced hard hat mack or something with cleverer level design.  Its pretty fun actually!
* Kickstart 2 (9/30/19) I really wanted this to be like excitebike.  I always wanted an NES and hoped that this would be like that.  Inever bought it but I wanted it to be that good and wanted to buy it.  Its not bad. Much more like trials than excitebike.  The sprite rotations are actually pretty damn impressive.  I would have had a few minutes of fun with this bitd. 
* Kid Gloves 2 (9/30/19) 1992OH this is the game I was thinking I would have liked.  This one is pretty different.  How are they even related haha?  Yeah I probably would have liked this for a while.  This is actually like Wonderboy.  I like the attack a lot actually.  Its a great attack mechanic for a game like this.  I would like to play a wonderboy game with an attack like this.  The attack mechanic makes the core gameplay really different.  I love how the hair flies when he falls.  its pretty damn cutesy which isn't my favorite thing but it works here.  I like how the attack mechanic kills so readily and satisfactorily.  I didn't expect to like this as much as I do!  Shucks theres a tight timer in the game. I did it!  Ice Island section two here I come!  Now section 3!  Controls are pretty great especially how he snaps to moving platforms.   Well the enemies that take several hits are a bit silly because he cant hit them so he has to do some zelda 2 style attack patterns to hit and avoid.  Section 4!  HEY!  I got to the first boss and did pretty good against him!  This is a winner!  The music is pretty silly but thats ok.  
* IK+  Nice title screen with particles!  Oh damn this is 1988 Archer Maclean!  The graphic background is fantastic and the animation is great.  The 3d effect in the ball part is awesome!  Music is cool!  I dont know what the depth is here but it might be a fun hotseat party game.  I love all the attention to detail like the spider in the background and the scrolling hall of fame.  Good stuff!
* Hired Guns (9/30/2019) 1993.  I remember when this came out it was pretty revolutionary.  Lets see what its like now.  Super futuristic beautiful UI.  Four players! Its cool that you can choose players.  Interesting.  Are there different key sets for the four different players?  If you only have one player is there AI for the others?  its got Dungeon Master sort of controls and display but I dont understand the four player aspect.  I thought they were all supposed to be controlled by one player.  How could they compete then? Regardless of the competition I really like it.  I like diving into the first few practice dungeons which are simple and finding the key to solve the puzzles.  This kind of thing was the 3d of the day.  Well I cant figure it out at all so maybe I need to do a walkthrough but its really cool.
* Ghosts and Goblins - (10/1/19) Wow tons of cool cheats built into the WHDLoad for this one.  Maybe it will make it slightly fair?  Great graphic cover screen.  Yeah its got unlimited lives and time and start with the knife!  This is a really good version of the game especially with the cheats. ITs also got two button control option.  I find myself wanting a whole game played with just the knife with no other options and with better more fair levels because the controls with the knife are actually really fun. 
* Ghouls and Ghosts - (10/1/19)doesnt have the same cheats selection.  The graphics are areally good and look proper 16 bit.  This was 1988 too so that would have been really impressive.  Wait the character doesnt look 16 bit at all.  The hit boxes are terrible.
* Klax - (10/1/19)This is an ok port with looks like simultaneous 2p hotseat. Thats nice but I dont really like it.
* Historyline - (10/1/19) World War 1?  Wow An amazing movie intro animated on the front with great music and a vintage look.  Its amazing!  It depicts an assassination in sarajevo.  Wow a franco-German policy after 1871 was made to preventa ny further wars.  Bismarck.  This is an amazing history presentation in the intro.  Its pretty long though which I think is the point it wants to give you all of the history leading up to the game which is in 1914-1918.  This has amazing presentation all the way around.  Wow its a turn based strategy game wiht amazing graphics for 1992.  Its got great music too.  I cant figure out the UI at all but thats just me and I'm not motivated.  The quality here is incredible.  
* Into the Eagles Nest - 1987 (10/1/19) Wow this is like a zoomed in gauntlet in a ww2 infiltration scenario with locked doors and keys and ammo and its awesome!  I suspect the continue structure is broken but lets see ... The shooting feels great and it comes out of the right side of your body which is actually correct.  The graphics are great and detailed and the gameplay is screen based so it scrolls when you get to the edge.  Level 1 is probably too hard to ease people into the game.  its really big already.  uh oh.  I'm out of ammo.  I can take 50 hits RUN AWAY!  I got stuck between two guys since theres nothing you can do as far as fighting or shooting walls when you are out of ammo.  Oh wow you can select levels 1 2 3 or 4 but it seems like its the same map?   This is a really cool gauntlet clone that I would have somewhat enjoyed bitd.
* Harpoon and Battleset 1 - I bought a pc version of this game bitd and it was made in part by some of my family friends the homburgs.  Uh oh they launched missiles at me.  Someone is launching missiles back to try to destroy the incoming missiles.  You can speed up the time, I wonder if I am just watching a battle, no that was just an ally ship that fought and got destroyed.  I wonder if I could have done something to help it?   Well I later succesfully moved my ship around a bit and after a few minutes ran out of game time and since neither side reached minimum victory conditions the game is a draw.
* Grand Prix Circuit - Accolade (10/1/19) Ok I qualified in 5th not bad.  But this is pretty boring without other racers.  The graphics and control and sound are good though. Ok well its pretty good actually.  Unfortunately on my 3rd lap when I was WAY out in the lead (I lapped several others) its so realistic that I bumped someone and we both crashed.  Good game!
* Gobliins 2 (10/2/19) this is a really cute cartoony intro.  wtf is this?  some kind of point and click adventure?  this is not what I expected at all.  
* Goblins 3 (10/2/19) is this the same as that last game almost?  Fortunately this one didnt even run.  Whew!
* Hardball Accolade (10/2/19) Well its a playable enough game with some cool graphics.  Bitd I was entranced by the graphics of certain games in the magazines and while I always thought this game was cool it was Championship baseball which I wanted and got!
* Hard Drivin (10/2/19) I always kind of looked down on this game, but I think thats in part because I was jealous of anyone who had it.  I do remember playing it somewhere and sucking bad, but I loved 3d so Im sure I would have liked it if I could have gotten the hang of it.  Well the mouse controls are impossible even though it kind of looks like it was built to use them.  It was written by one guy?  wow!  I'm glad he got his name on the title screen.
* Hard Drivin 2 (10/2/19) Wow this has an external Track editor?  Thats amazing!  this is a good game and the mouse controls work (they might have worked in the previous game too but I'm used to them now a bit).  I was able to make a jump and part of a loop!  Its pretty cool that all that stuff was in 3d so long ago. 
* Ghostbusters 2 (10/3/2019) its some rocking intro music with some cool screencaps.  The game jumps right into the underground shaft.  I really like the lowering graphics, but this isnt fun gameplay this is like the shaft in battletoads.
* Hagar the Horrible (10/3/19)  Really cool title screen fire credit effect!  I've never really seen something like that where the text is filtered out by the graphics.  Wow the controls and attack are really good actually!  The level design doesnt make much sense and doesnt ease the player into it.   Well there are passwords for the islands you cant access at first.  Thats nice.  Let me try this level a few more times.  Whoa!  Weird that the mermaids are topless with nips showing.  It always strikes me as odd to see nips in kids games like this.  not wrong or problematic just un-status-quo. The jumps are way too specific and far which makes it less fun than it could be.  Its almost impossible to kill the bad guyz without taking hits.  Well I dont like it overall, but its so close.  If the platforms were arranged better and the enemies attack patterns were balanced better ...
* Hunt for Red October (10/3/19) what the hell is going on here?  I could hardly move or get any of the buttons to work.  
* Hudson Hawk (10/3/19) 1991 Ocean - Lots of cheats in the WHDLoad.  Wow the animation is so good and the graphics are so clear!  The character and enemy sprites are cute.  OMG if you stand in one place for like 30s it drops a piano on you!  CHEAP!  The Inertia and run and switch direction animations are amazing.  the jumping is terrible though because its diagonal which makes it uncontrollable.  
* Karate Kid 2 (10/3/19) Its kind of like IK+ but the collision is broken, its not as bad as a lot of other fighting games, but its just fighting with no story.  At least there are a few cool moves.  
* Gauntlet 2 (10/3/19) this came out 1988 but its amazing that the arcade of this came out in 1986!  Cool title screen graphics.  All the graphics look real arcadey and great.  Wow with a 4 player printer port adapter you can play four players!!!  Great scrolling blitter tricks on the title screen for the text.  Its tricky to get it started but I figured out you press f1 or f2 depending on which control you have.  This game is great.  The shooting is so satisfying and the levels are so interesting.  There are secrets all over the place.  This is great.  Also the enemies don't respawn, or I should say the respawn is a fundamental game mechanic that you can destroy (generators).  Thats a big deal imho.  Also its really cool that the maps loop seamlessly (sometimes at least).  And i love that they placed things such that a risk comes with the reward like it lets out some bad boys.    I also love that you can walk into enemies and yeah you lose a little health but  you also bash them to death.   this is so great.  I got to level 7 with 5 keys and had to go to bed.  (next morning - still 10/3) uh oh.  The continue structure is completely and utterly broken.  You get one life.  Theres not nearly enough food to regenerate you on the level I was on (7).  The WHDLoad has INfinite health, keys, or potions, or f6-f9 adds some food to palyer 1-4.  Interesting: I dont think these first few levels are the same levels as my last game.  with the trainer I would have enjoyed this a ton as a kid.  Without I would have been super disappointed.  One awesome thing: It uses the second joystick button to shoot potions!
* Indiana Jones and the last crusade adventure.  (10/5/19) Well the graphics aren't as good as the followup the fate of atlantis. but theyre good, theyre just a little more dos-like.  The animation is still great and especially for the time its all really good.  I think the dialogue options are great.   Theres a solution for this one in the WHDLoad folder.  This is good. 
* Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. (10/5/19) Whoa this is nothing like the last game.  The graphics are like c64 or atari in comparison and its some kind of overhead action adventure like zelda maybe?  The snake sounds are terrible.  yes its like zelda with a quick whip and one hit deaths. It stinks.  Actually its by atari and it feels exactly like an atari game but with slightly better graphics.  
* The Immortal (10/5/19) Wow this is something I always thought looked amazing.  At the same time I could tell that if I ever played it I wouldn't be able to get anywhere so I wasn't strongly drawn to it.  The controls and main character animations are really good.  
* Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade Action (10/5/19) no this isnt good. its a side scrolling platformer with stiff uncorrectable jumping and falling and sensitive controls.  You have a limited number of whips with each whip you collect which doesnt make sense.  This could have and should have been like castlevania with totally different setting and a few different mechanics.  
* GODS (10/7/19) this has awesome title track and graphics throughout including the title.  I wish I had bought this bitd even though I know I wouldn't have gotten terribly far I would have loved it and I always wanted it from the screenshots alone.  There is a password system.  Is there a time limit?  its not visible on the first screen.  And good news that it doesn't bombard me with enemies from the first moments.  well I spoke too soon about that actually!  Enemies spawn when you hit certain points but they dont respawn the next time you hit that point.  I like that.  And I noticed that enemies spawn when you hit switches but hitting switches also sets new spawn points for places you've been.  alright!  World one completed on 3rd life!  this is a really good game (even if as I suspect the continue structure is flawed).  the getting more powerful with those knives is really fun and satisfying.  You keep the keys you have when you die!  the jumping is pretty wonderful even if you have to commit and cant change direction its fair and pixel perfect with your toes.  It doesn't cheat you out of ledges at all and all of the cotnrols are responsive.  27851 was my score and I'm pretty proud of getting half way through the second level.  I don't know where the passwords come in though unless I missed it on the level one screen you must have to get further to continue from there. Update: Theres a [remake](https://jotd.pagesperso-orange.fr/gods/index.html) with a built in level editor
* Games Winter Edition EPYX 1988 (10/7/19) downhill is pretty fun pseudo 3d like a racing game. slolom is fun and you roll into a snowball if you hit a flag which is entertaining.  cross country is pretty good and I almost won!  yeah I won by one second this time! Ski jump was confusing and I couldn't jump.  Luge was interesting and I didnt crash or anythign but I didnt know what was going on.  With the figure skating I think I have to perform the same moves I just selected?  You get to pick a bunch of musics which is cool and I was able to pick new wave!  well I sucked and didnt get any tricks off but the animation is great for the skater.  Its pretty fun.  I think I liked summer games a bit better.  Its amazing how far games have come though and this is clearly primative.  It is C64/8Bit/early eighties looking stuff.  And they've got a whole opening ceremonies animation which is pretty cool.
* Jimmy Whites Whirlwind Snooker (10/7/19) This is by Archer Maclean like the pool game but even though I had pool this is the game the mags all talked about.  Wow it looks exactly the same.  I wonder if the only difference is the ruleset of the games?  yeah its the same.
* Hardball 2 1990 Accolade (10/7/19) hmm it looked pretty good but I couldn't figure out how to control it tbh.  
* Ikari Warriors (10/7/19) well this is somethign I always wanted to love.  I always thought it would be an amazing dual stick shooter but they never really did that.  Well there are lots of cheats in the whdload.   I have a feeling I'm going to need them.  Its got a cool demo of the whole first map in the intro and a cool crashed plane intro animation  I also liked how the crashed plane is in the first screen but they don't bother walking the player under or around it he just walks over it.  I actually think thats a totally reasoanble compromise of technolgy vs art.  Now if you dont move for like 10s they call in an air strike.  well its pretty terrible but I find it quaint and cute.  
* Elvira Mistress of the Dark (10/7/19) ooh its got sexy pictures and cool spooky music!  Wow the graphics are awesome and theres big animation like a movie.  Hey elvira saved me!  hey I got in a battle and won!   I guess its some combination of point and click and rpg with first person combat?  pretty cool!
* Golden Axe (10/7/19)	Theres a whd load cheat for unlimited health which is nice.  Graphics and music and sound and presentation are top notch!  enemy graphics and colors are great too.  The music is perfect.  the combat is perfect too!  Wow this is great.  I really wish I had bought this bitd.  wow it recognizes a second button for magic!  I dont know how they did it but they mapped jump just right so it only really requires one button!  the enemies die with fair amounts of damage.  This is really good.  Ok I made it to the turtle jump and the jump on the dragon killed me.  If you ask me I made it but alas.  I dont know if I would have made it if I wasnt on the dragon but I also figured I had another life (it said I had 1 life).  This is really good.
* Gauntlet 3 (10/9/19) Gauntlet 3 the Final Quest.  US Gold and Tengen Why final?  You know something I just thought of: I remember in the N64 and Dreamcast days there was a Gauntlet legends game that in hindsight I looked down upon.  Its weird but I loved Gauntlet so much in like 1989 (thats roughly when I became aware of it) that just like 10 years later I would think that gauntlet legends must be really shallow.  Thats what I thought of it but since then I've heard that if I had bought it back then and if I had given it a chance I probably would have loved the hell out of it.  My roommates and me probably would have played the whole damn thing together honestly.!.  Ok Gauntlet 3.  I actually think I would have liked this as a kid (assuming the continue structure is ok which I can't tell whetehr it is or not and probably isn't)  the music has pretty amazing sampled drums and sounds totally recorded.  Its isometric with pretty detailed sprites and animation, the AI is exactly the same, but the levels are fascinating and like youre in an adventrue not just in a dungeon.   Food is distributed pretty liberally so survival isnt terribly hard.   Well whats really cool is how it turns into a dungeon when yo go inside.  I really like this.  Usually a third game that departs ends up sucking but not this.   the music is exciting and atmospheric.  There isnt any sfx though.   I'm going to suicide to see what the continue structure is like although to be fair to the game to suicide is goign to be very hard and take a long long time.  These ghosts only take one life and Ive got 1000.  You can even go downstairs further into dungeons and stuff.  Its really cool!  If I stand next to a green goblin they take it down much faster but its still going to take like 3 minutes :)  I have to say I'm impressed.  this is a very good game which uses many of the mechanics of the previous games but in a fresh updated world and I really like it.  Oh and there are a ton of characters to choose from and it looks like 2 player hotseat.  ok down to 200 life.  Lets see what happens when I'm 0.  My guess: Game over.  Start over.  No continues.   Yup I was right.  Great game though!  The music reminds me a bit of SOTN actually but this was a long while before that.   
* Ishar Legend of the Fortress (10/10/19) Ishar Legend of the fortress. Silmarils software.  IT wouldnt run on A4000 but gets through teh title screen on A1200.  Unfortunately doesnt get any further than that.  
* Hunt for Red October the Move (10/10/19) Ok its got a cool aniamted intro to pull you in.  GREAT in game 80s movie music!!!  Then its a crappy floaty controlled side scrolling shooter.  Is this like the NES game that I rented with Aaron that one time?  I didnt like that game.  Great 80s score text font between levels too! One hit deaths three lives.  This is shit.
* It came from the desert 2 (10/10/19) Cinemaware.  I was so into these games just from magazine pictures.  I bought rocket ranger but I couldn't get anywhere but I still thought it was really cool!  Wow its a really cool story that effectively seems animated speech.  The conversations are really cool with good dialogue and they do make you feel like youre in a movie.  They had a sample of a mule singing!  Thats just for this one non critical conversation but they put it in there!  in reply you say "These guys will probably be my bunkmates in hell".  It kind of bums me out but it wont let you use the mouse even though that would have been perfect for this game.  not a big deal.  I actually have a license to this game for what its worth with my OS4 purchase.   The fortune teller gives you clues.  This is a pretty cool game although I'm quite sure I'm going to die soon and have to start over.  At least I started from a save game somewhere in the middle of the game.  time passes in the game even as you travel.  its a mystery game!  Its pretty exciting!  I don't know what I'm goign to do but I find clues sometimes.   i got in a fight with the g-men and they killed me.  I don't know how the fighting mechanics worked but it was pretty cool and kind ofmovie like with good graphics.    Whowa now theres an overhead sensible soccer style hospital escape scene.  This is really good.  There are lots of samples in this game oh shit jackie turned into a mutant ant!!!
* Jetsons the computer game - (10/11/19) Great intro with really good mod music and graphics.  The presentation here is fantastic.  The music is good and fun and entertaining and the graphics are really great.  THey look just like the cartoon. The controls aren't bad.  I don't really know whats going on. There are lots of little traps to trip on and fall over and lose energy. The most frustrating ones oare the ones that you can't avoid because they are immediately on the other side of the screen boundary.  Its a bit like pitfall but less fair in those cases.  There are also barely visible doors into the z axis of the screen that are only signified by two little white dots.  The collisions on the chairs are entirely broken.  they are way too tall and hard to avoid and dont match the 3d perspective at all.  Ugh same problem with the holes in the ground.  And those take 1/3 of your life and send you way back.  thats just frustrating and it could have been good.  
* Jaguar XJ220 - 10/14/19 I had a demo of this game and loved it so much and Betsy did too.  It was so great to play the demo.  Lotus 3 was great to play until you got to the cliff levels and it became shit but this one we only saw a few levels and it was fantastic.  I love the CD Player aesthetic.  HELL YEAH HEAVY METAL Track 4!  The interface to start the races is a bit odd because you hit exit to continue and eject to start the race.  Still it works just fine.  I've tried it on my two a4000 configurations and it seems to be playing faster than it should.  On level 1 I can't see any corners at all because its moving too fast.  OH! Theres a setting with 1,2,or 3 arrows and maybe thats the problem.  music or sfx not both.  Ok I got it playing at normal speeds, and I gave up pretty quickly but now I don't love it.  Theres nothing wrong with it but I dont love it.  
* Huckleberry Hound - 10/21/19 1993 theres a whdload help button level skip cheat which is nice.  Well the sprites look ok, the gems are glistening way too much making it busy.  but the backgrounds all blend together too much.  The platforms are several pixels too wide but at least that gives some grace space.  The jump is silly flipping around lazy sprite rotation but hey. jump and up both jump.  he doesnt jump in the direction youre pushing he jumps in the direction hes facing.  You have to collect all of the gems to beat teh level.  This isn't great but its also not broken but its was 10 year old gameplay in 1993
* Jurassic Park - 10/24/19 I'm playing with a trainer with infinite lives its got a password system of some sort.  I had to swap ports with the mouse for some reason.  Music is good.  Controls are good.  Graphics are good.  Its maybe like gauntlet or Chaos Engine?  
* Jurassic Park AGA - 10/24/19 Lets see how hard it is without the trainer.  menu graphics are crisper for sure. Scrolling is a bit jerky imho but that may just be my 2019 eyes judging it harshly.  In game graphics look 100% identical.  Oh you can fall off to lower levels where you cant get back up.  Thats fine if mildly annoying.   The electric weapon seems better than the bullet weapon that I got in the first game (which I didnt get in this game).  Its pretty good.  The map is large and interesting to explore and the enemies aren't too hard.  The electric weapon kills even big ones.  The combat is pretty good and fun.  Enemies seem to respawn but tehy aren't too hard and they move in interesting enough ways.  I got to a tower and activated a terminal with a menu!  Terminal presentation is fantastic.  From here you can shut off the nearby gates or something.  You can unlock bunker door but cant unlock security gate without a keycard (guessing it will be in hte bunker).  This is good stuff!  Hey I rescued one of the kids!!!  Well 3 lives and its game over but maybe if you get to the next level theres a password (Hopefully???)
* Judge Dredd - 10/24/19  1991.  this was before the movie. The intro screen is a cool terminal which says (c) 2034 and then 65 MBytes available to the user.  which is funny because even now thats a miniscule amount but back then that was an enormous amount!  Its like you have to know a bit of dos to fiddle with it here.  Theres a bomber exe and snakes exe.  Wow its a whole QBasic looking bomber game in here!  haha the phone numbers are 22 digits long!  Where I lived they had just become 10 digits.  Wow graphics are great on his sprite and animation.  Looks fantastic.  Its got a short black and white gameboy looking cutscene when you die.  The controls are pretty good and the shooting and jumping is good, fun, and controllable except I couldn't figure out going up ramps consistently (its like castlevania but doesnt work as well).  The graphics were great.  Not bad a tall!
* Hunter - 10/24/19  Whoa the 3d is awesome in this.  Some of the best I've seen and no dithering! wow with bird shadows too!  Wow and waving flags!  Holy crap you can swim!!!  Whoa you can boat around places too!!!  Holy crap a live minimap with textures on it!! Amazing!!! Ok tab gets me out of the boat.  I just got huge respect for this game.  Theres lots of different weapons and stuff you can shoot and I ran out of fuel on the boat so undoubtedly you can get more fuel and drive that all over the place.  How cool!  Oh holy shit in the demo hes driving a car over terrain hills and shit.  wow!
* Killing Game Show - 10/24/19 wow this 3d rendered intro is amazing!  I think I watched this recently on youtube or something.  "And now its time for the greatest show on earth".  Whoa cool theres a level select on the title screen!  I don't know how you unlock level 2 but maybe if you beat level 1 then you can continue from level 2?  if so then this game rocks!  I remember enjoying a demo of this game very much.  Now I see why.  Great rocking music.  Great graphics.  parallax scrolling.  Cool shooting.  Crawling on walls.  its amazing!  Oh holy shit its got several things I've hardly ever seen.  ITs got coordinates!  and more importantly and significantly its got REPLAYS!!!  It replays your previous life and you can even fast forward through teh replay.  that is one of the coolest things that I've never seen before ! Its so fair!   there are still a limited number of lives though.  hmm I wonder if you lose all of your lives on lefvel 2 if you can level select level 2?  thats one of the best continue structures I've ever seen in an Amiga game!  The only better would be save at any moment which I know basically none have
* The Halley Project - 10/24/19 from Mindscape in 1986.  Cool 80s digitized music loop!  We had this on C64 and although I thought it was cool I remember not being able to make any sense of it.  We also had a space shuttle sim of some sort which I thought was from Thunder Mountain.  Well I can't figure this out but there are some cool parts of it.  I'm supposed to get back to earth but I don't know how to move around in the radar.  I like the jets action and its cute that I can brake so quickly in space.  
* James Pond Underwater Agent - 10/24/19 it has a really funny fish roaring title screen and then fish chucks with big boobs.  I played through the second one and enjoyed it.  This has really pretty colorful graphics, lots of transparency and parallax and theres a beautiful rainbow copper effect at teh bottom with tons of colors in it more than the amiga can typically display and this was 1990 (2yrs before AGA) You know what I really like about this?  You unlock enough lobsters and you get to go out of the normal exit, but next to that exit is the special exit which you only get if you unlock all of the lobsters and it takes you further in the game (you can skip whole levels).  i think thats smart and really rewards exploration and completion but doesn't stop people from playing through.  The bubble mechanic is straight out of bubble bobble but works well in a totally different setting.  This is a platform game but you're swimming so its nothing like most others and certainly nothing like the 2nd game.  The high score entry screen is really great with the parallax inside the letters, the rainbow, and the circle effect.  
* James Pond 2: Codename Robocod  I dont remember if I played this in AGA before or ECS.  The presentation in these games is great.  The songs in this are the cutsiest ever.  This is a really cool game.  the scrolling is akin to sonic speeds honestly and is very impressive.  
* James Pond 2: Codename Robocod AGA - This one has impressive backgrounds and copper effects in the background
* James Pond 2: Codename Robocod CD32 - This has jump button mapped to a button and the stretch button mapped to a different button.  thats nice.  Otherwise identical to AGA version.
* James Pond 3: Operation Starfish AGA 1994.  Many amiga games didnt have music and fx at the same time, but all of the james pond games did.  Its funny that they let you select if you didnt want both.  Who wouldn't!?!  It makes sense if you can only have one to let the user select which but when both are available!?!  haha  Whoa this game has an overworld map!  there arent many Amiga platformers with an overworld.  haha the first game the sprite had no feet and was underwater 90%. The second game there wasnt any water but the sprite still jsut had land fins.  In this one he has full length legs and sneakers and dances like a silly guy.  its damn cute but haha  oh and I think hes in space btw.  The gameplay with the items doesnt make any sense.  it is cool how you can lock your boots to a block and run around it even upside down!
* James Pond 3: Operation Starfish CD32.  Ok its not bad.  I figured out taht if you hold the magnetic shoes button you can run really fast sonic style.  Its very much like sonic then going over different kinds of terrain but in this you can go faster uphill than sonic ever could which is pretty darn fun.  I beat the first level.  I still dont understand the part about picking things up but thats ok.  this isnt bad.  
* Gee Bee Air Rally - One of the Amiga Addict games 1987.  On easy mode this is really fun!  I can't tell if I'm winning or losing.  I finished 3 races and thought I did well and now I'm in a special event.  Well I didnt make that and bailed out of my plane. Its got a [cool bailout animation](https://youtu.be/hEIkOfYIILM?t=626) with huge graphics and man in 1987 this would have blown the mind.
* GOAL! Wow that intro sound and music really takes me back. This is one of the most important games I ever owned on the Amiga.  I was never good at it but I loved it so much.  It made me feel great inside to own it and it was so damn cool.  Wow the text on the teams screen is nearly impossible to read!?!  Wow this is such a great playing game.  For some reason these controls are more comfortable to me than kick off 2 even though I read that kick off has easier controls than this.  Still I just made a goal and I couldn't do that in kick off.  Its so damn good.
* Gridiron - I remember ordering this on the phone from some software company and calling gridirion and he was like "you mean grid iron?" with a bit of a scoff laugh and I was like "no I think its gridirion" or something haha.  Well I got it and I respect it and I bought it because it was in the Amiga Addict list (a list which I am lucky that my parents supported me getting so many games off of even if there weren't that many good enough (or easy enough) for me to get addicted to.) and I always thought how cool it would be to get deep into this and make my own plays but I really hardly ever even fired it up and certainly never figured out how to actually play it.  Well the menus are simple enough.  Wow you can draft a whole team!  First of all the sound is great! the hits and kick sound amazing and the crowd does too.  OOh I actually really like the controls.. D'oh I caused an interception.  Well damn this didnt take long to get the hang off.  The player follows the mouse.  I thought there were crappy graphics but its just simple dots but man does this work well.  The crowd sounds get better as you get closer to the line.   Wow this is my favorite football game ever!  ok I'm on practcie mode but still this really rocks!  It was apparently the first Physics based sports simulation.  and this was by bethesda the same company that went on to do elder scrolls!
* Guild of Thieves - This was the game I borrowed from Dallas at the Commodore Users Group.  Wow weird I played this on C64 but this amiga version has its own whole GUI system built in?  Well this is a really good text adventure.  I'm actually getting somewhere.  its funny because I distinctly remember in like 1989 firing this up on my C64.  Waiting forever for it to load, seeing some pictures which was unique since zork only had text, and getting almost no where in the game.  I feel like I floated on the boat a bit or something but I am already further than I ever got back then.  That was 30 years ago wow!  Interesting you have to select the graphics from a menu and holy crap theres an automap in this game!  What a treasure!  and wow this game is also on the app store!  I'm buying it now.  
* Monkey Island 2 LeChucks Revenge - 10/25/19 from 1991 The animation and music in this is incredible.  OH This is a Tim Schafer game ( in part).   I think its running a bit too fast on the JIT.  I'm picking monkey island lite so its not too hard and so it skips some puzzles whether its do able for me or not I'm impressed and glad that they have an easy mode.  The writing is epid. "Big Whoop"  haha!  lol he lost all of his enormous amount of money right at the beginning.  It was cool how he wiped his wide eyes off of his face.  It plays great and the clicking is responsive and the sprites are scaled well.  its so beautiful.  The conversation about a woodchuck is fantastic dialogue.  Boy thats a great game.  Although I dont know how to save it.
* Manix - 10/27/19 Wow this is by one guy?  its kind of like Qbert.  Apparently 2 players???  this is really cool at elast on level 1.  I Owned this and remember it getting too hard for me to do anything and falling off of slants.  Its got some great catchy tunes by Furniss.  I beat the third level and it was prettyt ricky.  Its the one I remember being hard.  Or wait maybe its the fourth.  3 lives left.  Alright I beat that too!  Ok I beat the enxt and technically the 6th screen is scene 05.  I got 3130 and got on the high score table.  whats weird is when the high scores showed moments later my name wasn't there!?!  Rip off!   Oh and then there was an exception address error apparently when it gets to one of the screens of the intro it crashes.  I think I could eventually beat all 8 or so stages of level 1 I bet it would take 30 more minutes.  This is a really good game.  
* Myth - System 3 1992 10/27/19 I remember this game capturing my imagination with its incredible graphics.  I remember feeling good about myself becauase I could actually beat parts of it!  I got several levels in - maybe just to level 3 or so but I got to level 2 only with the help of the in-manual walkthrough (only through level 1 though).  I certainly wouldn't have made it otherwise.  I also remember doing it only by the skin of my teeth and after much practice but the cool thing is with that small walkthrough I felt some actual success in a game and that meant a lot for me.  It made me want to play it many times even if I died because I actually knew how to make real progress.  I was motivated!    I remember unfortunately that I got really far (for me) and then the game crashed on me on my Amiga 3000.  And I thought "shucks thats weird!  must have just been a fluke" and then I spent another hour trying to get to the same place again and ... it crashed again.  I had to return the game because it wouldn't run completely on my machine which is so sad because I might have been motivated enough to get really far.  Perhaps I might have even with some help from others for clues perhaps eventually beat it and wow I would have been so proud!  The flames behind the text in the intro is bad ass!  Arrow keys to switch weapons.  Man the amiga would have benefitted so much from another button like everything else had in 1986 (or 4-8 buttons by 1992).  You know what I love about this game?  You explore a little cave room which is spooky because of lighting and because you're constantly under attack (a little respite in some areas would be nice honestly) and these parts are kind of like wizards and warriors which is great but thats not my point, you explore and find what you need in the room and then use it elsewhere in the room and you have to look all over.  You can't move very fast so you have to plan things out a bit and I like that slow paced combat a lot.  I got the sword from a random enemy drop (I wouldn't have made it a random drop but whatever) and i can move it in my invenotory with the arrows however I dont actually know how to wield it.  I know that stuff is in the manual somewhere.  oh its space.  Well I actually had pressed that but space only activates the one in the middle.   Wow the demon sprite that comes out of the hells is ENORMOUS!  I love enormous sprites!  the WHDLoad trainer has unlimited lives which makes this great!  omg a funny side effect of them not having safe zones is I spawned in at the top left and the demon boss was right there to kick my ass!  I did  it I got to Skyros the isle of sirens!!!  Theres a manual and a solution in the folder with it.  What a great game.
* Myth - System 3 CD32 10/31/19 Well this is weird its exactly the same.  I'm not sure this is a cd32 version because the buttons didnt cycle weapons or anything it was the same keyboard combinations!?!  If this really is the cd32 version then how did anyone play it and why aren't the buttons working.  The graphics are identical too.  Oh well.\
* Jet - 1988 Sublogic 10/31/19 Well I dont know how to take off but its cool that you can fly F16 and arm it with lots of weapons.  This is 1984 software design and it shows but the 3d looks good for its time and apparently it was compatible with sublogics flight scenery disks which is pretty bad ass.  This one was apparently easier to get into than flight simulator and I think thats pretty cool.  Still I dont know how to play it but I was able to launch weapons on the ground and look at the plane from different angles and it even brought up picture in picture windows for external viewpoints which is pretty bad ass.
* Gunship - 1988 Microprose.  I always wanted to play this game because for some reason I loved the idea of helicopters.  really cool animated title screen where the ship shoots down the logo to the sounds of  flight of the valkyries.  I like that it has settings to make everything easy and simple.  Thats a nice relief.  The mission part is pretty awesomly realistic adn really immerses you in the action because you have to know your countersign (probably because they will be talking to you and others and you need to know what to do) and it confirms that you know it before you take off.  I dont know my countersign and it doesnt say what that is but I wrote down everything I could think to   Its cool how you do weapon loadouts and the cockpit graphics are actually awesome.  You can look left and right with smooth scrolling with the arrow keys.  I hit escape once and it cancelled the mission completely!?!  the rotors were turning and I was about to figure out how to take off (but hadnt yet). Oh I looked in the manual and countersign is copy protection based on your password.  Amazing is that it keeps your difficulty settings.  I dont know how it does that!?!    Oh man the whdload guy didnt know the game because the key to take off (the best way) is the same key to quit the game!  I have tried this like 5 times now but I think I can do it, well no on the 6th time even the slow take off doesnt work so I would have to remap keys somehow and I've lost interest.  This was pretty groundbreaking for the time though and I would have had lots of fun with it for a while and felt super immersed.  
* Gunship 2000 (1993) (Not from the year 2000 haha) Microprose wow this office scene animation is amazing!   The UI for selecting options is amazing too - just like a cockpit.  Well the graphics look better but I still couldn't figure out how to take off.  I bet this would have been a lot of fun, especially if I had the previous one.  
* Gunship 2000 AGA Wow this has speech.  The graphics are not that different imho which is disappointing.  Well I was able to take off and its pretty darned cool.  I got fired upon but didnt die but gave up because there is so much to learn but thats pretty great.
* Heroes of the Lance 1988 SSI - oh wow this is a dragonlance game!  It introduces all of the characters with cool artwork.  oh wow I love how you have 0-9 slots to save your game!  Is it like a side scrolling platformer?  When you press almost any key you get a menu and you can change characters and  spells and use take give or drop items.  The graphics aren't clear and I just fell in a pit.    Yeah apparently its a side scroller.  You can save at any moment which totally rocks.  The enemy AI is unforgiving (casting an endless barrage from teh other side of the screen) and I don't know how to shoot back even though I know some of my characters have ranged weapons.  I suspect therws a way.  There are also lots of traps you need to see coming in advance by falling into them and restoring (by lots I mean I encountered one immediately that I could never have dodged so I presume there are more)  I didn't like this but it is pretty cool that they tried something like this and I love the cast of characters from the books.  
* Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy - 1986 Infocom - inventory: 1. A splitting headache.  2. No tea.  Ha!  Well its pitch black and I couldn't get out of the first room so I give up.  This is one of those that I might play again someday on a modern machine. 
* Kings Quest 1 Enhanced - never played any of these before but I've got 1-6 right here.  The Quest for the crown.  The graphics are great and shiny (even if using CGA colors haha) cool music too.   Wow its got water reflections! I fell in the water and got destroyed by a serpent.  Theres a pretty long load after every screen haha  about 3s then a wipe.  There are birds flying and chirping and fish jumping and splashing.  The details are fantastic.  Its real specific about where you click and wont automatically route you around any bushes or anything.   I have no idea what I'm doing.  The dithering is constant but the art is pretty good for the time.  Ok I went right and ended up at the left side of the castle like I had gone entirely around the world. I'm confused and a bit bored but its pretty cool for the time.  I don't think I would have liked it if I had personally bought it.
* Kings Quest 2 umm the graphics on this are super low res and look way way worse than the previous enhance one.  wow.  damn. You really have to use your imagination here.  Thats ok, theres cool animation and it tells a good story. omg the walking is so slow its painful.  I give up.  Its like low res MS paint art.
* Kings Quest 3 - uh oh this looks like the same low res of the 2nd game.  At least screen loading times aren't like the first one.  
* Kings Quest 4 The perils of Rosella - props to them for keeping going 1990.  Graphics are a bit better.  These look like the enhanced first game graphics.  The music is real beepy (like direct pc port beepy)  Wow king has a heart attack right at the beginning of the game?  I like the graphics and speech bubbles they tell a great story.  Oh looks like I accidentally skipped some cutscenes because I'm on a beach!  I almost caught a unicorn!
* Kings Quest 5 1992 - now instead of high quality CGA ported to Amiga ( which always looks better on amiga) this looks like high quality VGA ported to amiga (which often looks worse on amiga)  The intro cartoon is real movie like and nice.  Well damn I was 5 minutes into the movie or more and one click skips the whole rest of the movie without warning?   I thought it would click one dialog box which was sticking around too long!?!  oh god the walking is so damn slow.  oh god oh no this sucks.    The sprite scaling is cool and the art is great.  THe screen loading times are still ... impressive.  Its cool that the owl is following me around. 
* Kings Quest 6 This one has even more movie-like cutscenes with large screen video (sort of)  The graphics are much better on this one.  Is this AGA?  Well I can't move around theres a problem with the mouse on this one but it looks pretty cool if more of the same.  I'm shipwrecked in this one. Does that mean they were pinching off monkey island ideas?  This port was apparently done by a third party (which was a first for them since previously they had done the Amiga ports themselves but had decided not to do any more Amiga ports.  And all of a sudden the cutscenes are unskippable.  Well cool i'm in and can move around and I found a castle.
* Nicky Boom 1992 Microids - Hmm the microid logo kind of sucks.  and the cover screen kind of sucks too.  Ok the in game graphics are ok if silly.  THe music is ok too and pretty fun.  THe controls are pretty good.  Ok the music is growing on me and the gameplay is too.  I would have loved this as a kid.  YOu can actually make progress.  unlimited apple core ammo too.  Its a funny quirk that the pickups have to stop bouncing before you can pick them up.  It slows everything down but theres no time limit so thats ok.  The map is interesting and there are warps to secret areas.Oh wow and in the manaul they make clear that the game has 8 levels and each time you get across a level you get a code which you can play again from that point.  Thats wonderful and fair!!!  Well I got stuck but not unfairly and I'm duly impressed.  
* Nick Faldos Championship Golf - porn music - the UI is a bit confusing.  They didn't give me time to read the course description.  The 3d graphics look good maybe a bit like racing graphics.  The on course UI is pretty clear though.  I coudln't figure out how to hit the ball correctly so I gave up.  
* New Zealand Story - I was sure this would be terrible and like Dizzy but no its way better.  the control is good and theres shooting and unlimited ammo (which makes things more fair) and its straightforward that you have to save your buddies.  Pretty good!
* Neuromancer - 1987/88  I always thought this would be the coolest game ever.  This is a lot of text and really great graphics.  Wow the graphics are so clear adn cool for 1987.  Wow this is impressively complicated but really cool.  Theres an ATM which has messages like a BBS.  There are 4 save game slots which is great and apparently save at any time too.  oh wow the screen scroll between screens is fantastic.  This is a really cool BAT style futuristic point and click.  I paid for my food and got a clue.  Cool.
* Monty Python the computer game 1990 - Its got some sampled speech and good theme music.  Cool cartoons!  The whole thing is like one fo the monty python cutscenes and thats pretty cool.  For good reasons the levels make no sense at all and the gameplay isnt' great, but its pretty funny to play for a few minutes.
* Mindwalker 1986 one of the first Amiga games.  (I think this WAS the first) wow those are cool blitter color effects!  I bet in 1986 this would have blown the freaking mind.  Its smooth 3d gameplay actually.  Impressive for the time.  I didn't really know what to do and wasn't drawn in but its pretty cool nonetheless.
* Magic Johnson's Basketball 1989 - wow the graphics are really clear and good its two on two and looks great and the sound is good.  The controls are incomprehensible, except for a really cool first person shooting mechanic which seems to take over every time you want to shoot.  I didn't get the hang of it tbh.
* M1 Tank Platoon 1990 Microprose.  Its cool you can choose detail level and the intro tank animation coming at you is awesome!   This is some kind of overhead simulation?  I thought it was 3d?  Its pretty complicated and I'm not impressed anymore.  Its cool for being a cool tank sim but thats not interesting to me.  
* Manic Miner - whoa you can play manic miner or manic miner 2  haha the graphics are so 1982!  They look like MS Paint for reals.  wow thats terrible.  If I had loved the c64 or speccy version I might have had some fun with this but otherwise yuck.
* Little Computer People 1986 Its a House on a Disk - Oh these graphics animations are great!  Very interesting.  One of the first sims games.  By david crane too.  Looks good but I couldn't get any of the commands to work so I didn't know what to do at all.  
* Mega-lo-mania - cool music and graphics in intro!  ok so its a god game?  I actually thought I would love this bitd.  Wow its by sensible software?  Well thats cool.  I loved populous 2 a ton (well until my cousin criticized it and I took it personally and never liked it so much anymore).  Well thats a pretty cool game.  I think I could beat a few levels of it if I gave it some time.  In this game the interface is actually pretty easy to figure out and I really like that about it.  
* Megatraveller 1 - Late in my amiga days I heard a lot about this game.  The Zhodani Conspiracy a science fiction role playing game.  I picked 'get started quick' hey and the writing is really good and draws you in and makes you want to progress and succeed.  Back in the 80s and 90s (this was 1990 I think) RPGs were so cumbersome I have to pick who will be buying the stuff for which character and I don't think like that although I suppose it is technically more 'rp' if you do, I want to be a person controlling these people not try to get into all of their heads, and more importantly not want to deal with the minutae of all of their pockets.  The graphics remind me of  battletech.  They scroll pretty slowly but they are effective enough and look pretty clear.  The controls are not bad but as of 2019 they feel cumbersome.  There was plenty to do and I would have spent some time with this probably in the same way I did Phantasy Star where I would get stuck when things got just a little bit harder.  
* Microprose Golf 1990 - Wow its in 3d! You can do a steadicam to fly forward on the course.  I think I like the clicking mechanic to shoot.  That could be a whole game in itself.  It took me a bit of clicking (because most UIs back then were unintuitive) but I figured it out for the most part and was able to make some decent shots.  The 3d is pretty smooth!   Ok thats a good golf game for sure.  I'm actually really impressed and would have spent quite a while with it.  I always wanted to actually.
* Microprose Soccer - BOy I always wanted this game so bad.  I saw this even for the C64 and omg I didnt realize that this was microprose soccer but it was by sensible software!?!  it was 1988.  man the graphics on this are stunning. The ball is 3d and the players are so big and good looking.  Wow and there was a TV style rewind and replay effect too that was killer!  Kick off didnt come out until the next year and probably in many ways inspired by this.  In this game the ball is stuck to your foot which I think I like, although in kick off its not which I will admit is more realistic, and apparently is like the NES game soccer from 1985.  This is a really cool piece of history here.  Lets see if I can make a goal!  It was going in when half time whistle blew!  Now I cant make any sense of which player I am selecting at any time at all.  I'm making some good shots.  It loosk like the C64 version was pretty darned good too.  On my 5th game I made a goal!!! I am so proud!   The controls on these games are so sensitive to joystick direction and thats not something Im used to coming from the consoles but it worked for a lot of people just fine apparently.  yay!  Kick off2 and sensi are better for sure but its really cool to see this history and where it came from
* Mig 29 Fulcrum - Wow thats a cool intro flying past the kremlin so low.  Wow it just puts you in the cockpit.  Something about me appreciates that actually.  Well I couldn't take off so I really dont know about this one. 
* Mighty Bomb Jack -  1987 1990 Tecmo - I used to think this was a rip off of bomberman.  Well I dont know but that kind of sucked.  I can't relate to it and with 3 lives and one hit deaths I'm not a fan.  I dont even know if I could set off a bomb or not I did something but I dont know.   I tried it again and I found the jump/float mechanic interesting actually.  I think this might be fun for a few short romps in an arcade but it would also steal your coins.  
* Leander - 1991 Psygnosis - Now heres one that I wanted to own and master from the day and moment I saw it in the store or a magazine but I think it was at computerwise and one of those that I don't know why I didnt buy it frankly because I loved it so much.  Theres a WHDLoad infinite lives cheat here which is cool.  oh this is by travellers tales.  I think they're important now.  Hey they did lego star wars and some sonic games in the late 90s!  and they did some of the disney games in the late 90s.  Great intro music who and great exciting anime styled title screen.  Oh cool on the title screen theres a code so you can start on later worlds!  Its got good gameplay too.  Theres no fx (music instead) but he jumps good and attacks good.  the enemies respawn maybe a bit quick.   Its not one hit deaths and I think your life has something to do with the color of your armor oh and importantly it has support for two button joystick or gamepad!  It looks like it was built in even back then!  That would have been a big deal for me personally.  If you duck and hold attack it will charge up and kill you and attack everyone else too (I think). I didn't figure out how to beat level 1 but I did cover most of the ground and I bet tehres just something I have to do a bit different.  This is a really good game.  The 3d and blitter fx in the continue and game over and high scores are awesome. The load screens between levels have text but you cant read it because this version of the game is loading so quickly haha.  The boulders on level 2 were super cheap.  I wonder if there is a skill to getting through them without getting hit at all?  I kind of doubt it.  Yeah actually you can attack them so there is a way.  Ive got the key and just need to find the exit.  One cool thing that I think all games should do is their pickups when they come out they stay out they dont go away after a few seconds.  They will even go through lives.  And another cool thing when you die you start right where you left off!  Alright I beat level 2 and it was fun!  3 lives left.
* Mercs - I remember nearly buying this because it had co op and I think it would have been a lot of fun.  Thats part of the reason I wanted Chaos Engine also.  This looks cool and has a cool war story with a rambo hero feel.   The gameplay is so decidedly arcadey though and the boss (and really most of theenemies) so cheap that its not that fun. The graphcs are great and the sprites are aweosome and the text is awesome.  I beat level 1
* Nigel Mansells World Championship - By Gremlin  The earth spinning is a great graphic.  The graphics in this are great with awesome world specific backgrounds.  Well thats good racing.  I probably would have had a lot of fun with this as a kid although its too hard for me atm.  I would have spent some time with it and beaten a few races at least.  Graphics are great although not 3d like in F1.  Sounds and feel are fantastic.
* Nigel Mansells Grand Prix - interesting: Not by gremlin like the world cup.  Ugh.  Graphics and sound ok, steering ok.  Shifting too much for me to enjoy.  It was clever though pushing up accelerated (so you'll be doing that naturally) and pushing up and the buttom shift up so you can just hit the button to shift up one.  Pretty clever imho.
* Maniac Mansion - Lucasfilm 1989 - This has a cool story.  The graphics are good but primitive (but this is a really early game).  The intro isnt skippable. I always thought I would hate this because I dont like big heads very much or at least Ididnt like that about this game. Its cool that you can pick different kids including women.  And its cool you can switch between them!  Well this doesnt make any sense.   If you like stuff like this I bet its great.  The colors are a bit weird but tahts because its aport I presume.  I looked in a solution so I should be able to at least enter the house.  Lets find out. Yay Im in!  Well its funny how they animate and I like the lighthearted style for sure.  I bet this felt like a 1980s teen horror movie to a lot of players bitd.
* Marble Madness - wow this was early: 1986!  WHDLoad Infinite time if you want it.   Graphics are great!  really great!  I love this style so much.  The shading is so cool.  it just gets so hard so quick.  The difficulty curve is much too steep.  Alright I made it to level 4.  I think I've always thought that a game with these graphics and style would be amazing if it were an adventure and if map and enemy difficulty wasn't the primary antagonist.
* North and South - Presentation of this is amazing.  oh it looks like I started a computer vs computer game.  oops.  Well that will give me and idea of whats going on.  Whoa its got a side scrolling battle section with punching and throwing knives on a train where youre trying to raid the train in time which is pretty awesome.  well I mean damn its pretty damn entertaining watching them play themselves.  the south defeated the north in like 5 minutes :) 5 months game time. Thats a pretty cool game in cpuvscpu mode!
* Nitro - Psygnosis.  Cool post apocalyptic graphics with chrome mad max style  great intro!  it shares a few similarities with Rock n Roll Racing actually.  Its got clint eastwood in it!  good music too!  Its really hard for me.  The buying gear interface is crazy because it should be 8 directions but instead you rotate around the car with right for clockwise and left for counter.  Its bizarre.  When theres only one lap per race you dont get any chance to get a feel for the track.   Apparently you just keep playing as long as you have gas?  oh man theres a drity trick in the UI,  it cycles between taking input and being a menu so as soon as it switches to taking input thats when I decide to switch it from being a menu and it takes my input as an EXIT so I dont get to spend my money!?!  Wow its a cool game where you can actually survive!  I'm not going to win whatever long term competition because I've lost 4th place in every race but whats cool is now that I've upgraded my car I'm faster than everybody.  My rank is 'no hoper'  I guess you can play 3 plaers in this game which is bad ass (2 joysticks and keyboard).  I'm pretty impressed.  I'm in the forest now?  Regardless of my long term outcome in the races I have been playing for like 20 min and its still fun and the games not over!  alright Thats a great fucking game!  You can actually play it for a long while which makes it much more fun!  It keeps like a total time for each zone I guess.  
* Menace Psygnosis 1988 - Great presentation on all of their games for sure.  So the graphics are not great but are just fine for 1988, but the shooting is very good and fun and its not so hard that it killss you right away.  There are shields so I guess I've probably been hit a few times but I havent died yet.  what I really like is that even though its proceeding to the right the enemies kind of come in waves in a cool way that give you the littlest respite and way to get your bearings.  Oh wow! I beat the first level the sea of karnaugh!  51180 was my #7 highscore!  and wow it lets you restart each level too with full health!  This is a great game!  YES!! I beat level 2 as well!!! Woo Hoo!!! Vanguard Warzone Complete!
* Magic Pockets - This game always looked like it had great graphics but I judged it because I cant relate to the style.  Lets see if its any good.  Oh its the bitmap bros!  Well ok I dont know about this game.  The graphics are great but the shooting doesnt make sense honestly and apparently I'm supposed to spin?  Its not like super 'fun' for me.
* Lotus - This is the cool intro sound from NJenkin Videos!  This is a good game but its got two funny things about it: 1. only half a screen.  Well I played this just a few months ago and it was good but it had something else wrong with it that lotus 2 didnt ... maybe it was missing a minimap?  or maybe it was far too much drag when you hit a barrier or far too many block enemies.  I don't remember.
* Lotus 2 1991 - There are some codes for the different levels.  I wonder if those were given out by the game?  This is one of the best games on the amiga.  It really is weird how similar Lotus 3 is to lotus 2.  Lotus 3 was really just an expansion and probably should have just been a special edition (indeed on Genesis it was called Lotus2:RECS.  I suspect they thought that the track editor would mean more to players to have unlimited tracks and I don't blame them for thinking that because there is certainly something to that.    Well This one doesnt have a minimap either.  Its got a link feature with other amigas which would have been an epic lan party thing to do.  I didn't beat that first level.  Hey cool its got a password system so you can get back to that race!  I like that very much.  I got pretty darn far a few months ago.  I can find out on my mac how far I actually got.   
* Last Ninja 2 - 1990 Played the first game on C64 for a bit but really got nowhere.  System 3.  I killed one guy.  the movement is so damn clumsy it makes me mad just moving around.  I can see why it was cool, but geez.
* Last Ninja 3 - I dont think theres much of a chance I'm going to like this so I used the Whdload cheat to one hit kill enemies.  Wow this is a cool movie intro!  Shows the ninja breaking a neck!  Cool music.  Cool graphics.  Same shit.  And the one hit dien't even seem to work.  
* Last Ninja 3 CD32 - Its exactly the same.   In one sense its the cheapest game ever since the first frame of the game is you getting hit.  OMG you can just walk off the edge and die?  
* Nigel Mansell World Championship AGA - Gremlin with cool music.  Its exactly the same as the other afaik.  I bet there are a few more colors but otherwise identical.  I could get into 3rd place but overtaking to first seemed impossible even on teh easiest track I could find (Germany)
* Nigel Mansell World Championship CD32 - Its cool how all of these have one wheel bouncing when you hit something, its pretty realistic for one wheel to lose grip.  
* Lotus CD32 - If the graphics are different I cant see it.  Probably in the copper effects in the background but this is pretty much lotus 1 shoveled onto cd32.  The control in these games is smooth as butter.
* Might & Magic 2 1990 - Ive never played any of these in any form.  Graphics are awesome.  Party selection is awesome.  It lets you have a bunch of characters on disk (like 20+) and select just some of them for your party.  I like that all of the commands have keyboard shortcuts.  really in this game its keyboard based so those arent shortcuts they are the command!  I dont think theres a mouse pointer and tahts fine.  I think the animations in this look fantastic.  Wow theres a minimap with lovely graphics for walls and doors!  The movement is much crisper than in bards tale.  Its quick (Update: Realized later I was playing this on JIT amiga so it was probably that that made it quick).  You can trust that when you push forward its going forward.  The 3d effect seems to leave off walls if they extend too far to the right or left which is clumsy and makes it hard to see clearly whats there but not a problem.  EOTB was 1991 for Dos and later to amiga, this game was 1988 for apple and 1990 for amiga so this is 2-3 years earlier in tech but moves just as smooth.  The graphics are certainly great but also are cartoony - more cartoony by several degrees than bards tale.  This game feels smoother than bards tale.  
* Might & Magic 3 - wow this has a credits intro with a starfield and substantial speech with good voice acting!  omg I just looked and this has 55+ hours playtime.  Fuck no.  This was 1991 so the same year as eotb and has a much more eotb interface actually.  The view is large animated and colorful.  For those kinds of games this is really good.  Unfortunately these features are accompanied by lag in the same way the Bards Tale 3 was laggy and slow.  I just tried it on my fast amiga and it wasn't as snappy as mm2 but it wasnt what I would call slow just a bit of an input lag.  Its so nice to not have any input lag.   For me it makes a big difference to how tiring the gameplay is.  
* Leisure Suit Larry 1 Enhanced - I suspect I will enjoy this the same as kings quest.  There are a bunch of funny history questions before you start the game.  Walked around the back of a building.  peed in the alley.  Walked into the street and died.
* Leisure Suit Larry 1 - omg there are tits on the title screen!  It actually kicks you out if you get the adult questions wrong!!!  Its a trivia based age verification!  Ok I looked up all of the answers.  One cool thing about this is you can speed up the game so he moves very fast.  In this version you have to type what you want him to do sometimes. pee.  Wow this was 1987.  The graphics in the enhanced are vastly improved.  Several generations of improvements imho, but the speed increase of this makes it better in many ways.  
* Leisure Suit Larry 2 - This whdload isnt cracked so I cant get in.  Even when I look up the codes online they dont work
* Leisure Suit Larry 3 - Wow the graphics have improved somewhat. The colors are still weird since its a port.  
* Leisure Suit Larry 5 - Well this has way more text which makes it more like a movie and I like that they are improving the interfaces with every game.  
* License to Kill - I feel like i might have had this game but never played it even once.  if not then I certainly saw it at the store or magazines so much I wanted it.  Oh man the graphics are really good and the music and presentation is great.  Theres a great intro screen with digitized roger dalton.  but playing this crappy shooter part is impossible and not fun.  
* Loom - 1990 Lucasfilm - So this should be like Monkey Island and Indiana Jones.  Man when I was a kid I wanted to love these games so much.  Apparently this was by an Infocom implementer!  It was first on DOS with EGA graphics and it shows. wow it came with a tape witha  30 minute audio drama for background.  Thats fucking amazing!  The music seems woven carefully into the game which is really cool.  Wait.  One of the reviews says "as an adventure game its just too lightweight.  Its impossible to fail"  PERFECT!!! another reviewer said it was "too short" Also perfect!!!  This is a winner then!  The graphcis are great with great shadows and lighting.  Lets se if save load works (F5) it sure does!  This is a winner for me.  One of the few I'm not afraid to really sink my teeth into.  Even though I would love to beat monkey island someday to experience the whole thing, I dont stand a chance at the puzzles.  My brain doesnt work like that but I love the atmosphere and the story and I love trying a bit to beat the puzzles because a few of them I will be able to figure out and feel proud.  That indiana jones from above though that really makes me want to play it I loved the few minutes I spent with it.
* Legend of Kyrandia - 1992 Westwood - whoa the house vines are talking to me.  Thats pretty magical actually.  It looks just fine and I bet its great.  It didnt grab me though.  
* Links - I never liked this game perhaps because the graphics didnt capture my imagination but partially because Id never heard the term links and it didnt make sense in connection with golf.  This one seemed too serious a simulation for me to really enjoy.  I bet my parents would have enjoyed one of the golf games though.  The animation is good.  The player sprites are ok.  I like the shooting mechanic though it wont blow the mind it works well.  
* The lost vikings - Well theres a password system!  The sprites are cute.  its great that the intro shows you all of their abilities.  haha I love that it got techno :) That kind of won me over actually.  not at all what you expect.  the big one has crack when climbing ladders haha!  GR8T is the password for level 2.  Well you know what if it gives you a password after every level then I dont care how hard this is this has a solid functional continue structure.  This seems to be a great game although I dont love puzzles like this I might actually like this one.  
* Lamborghini American Challenge - Its Crazy Cars 3.  The racing is pretty smooth. The graphics and backgrounds are awesome.  The whole structure where you have to buy your way into pole position and upgrade your car is really cool and when you can go all over teh country that makes it a great adventure.  Plus you drive a lamborghini!  Unfortunately I wasn't even able to get in the top 10 positions except for a few seconds 9.  Probably something I'm doing wrong or an upgrade I need.
* Mortal Kombat - The digitized graphics are pretty washed out here.  But its not bad.  I won a match and it played ok.  I don't have any idea what the controls are with just the one button but ... at least I won so its not stupid unfair like capital punishment or body blows
* Mortal Kombat Censored - I didnt even notice the difference and wouldn't have cared as a kid it still would have been fun.  I have no idea how to do the special moves.  
* Lost Dutchman Mine - Magnetic Images.  The sprites are cute.  I dont know what this is?  An adventure?  I think so.  
* Lion King AGA - 1994.  The Amiga was not doing well in 1994 so its cool that this still came out.  Great intro and music!  well this has incredible sprites and animation.  It looks like it has lots of checkpoints.  the controls and platforming is great.  The scenes in the background are awesome and reminiscent of the movie.  Oh wow enemies dont always respawn when you die.  Thats rare and awesome.  Theres some slowdown.  its still a bit too hard and uninteresting to me atm, but when I was a kid me and Betsy would have loved this.  
* Lionheart 1992 Thalion - Wow intro graphics are amazing.. Haha: Difficulty: Normal, Hard, Lionhard.  Classic!  I think its cool you can choose the introduction from teh menu if you want to see it again.  Awesome Intro where hes putting on his armor and is a bad ass.  Whoa a dragon!  Whoa a pet dragon!  The cutscene is awesome especially with the dramatic music.  Great liquid effect!  Combat is funny but might actually work really well.  Oh yeah 2 button controls!!!  Ok well the platforming isnt perfect because the platforms dont correspond exactly with the hitboxes.  This was a common problem and I should be able to adjust.  The graphics are wonderful though the blitter effect is so good.  Its kind of like you are he-man.  its pretty hard though.  the platforms are close but not perfect which isnt a general problem generally the platforming is good. Teh combat sure is weird but its kind of fun.  I want to see him battle some beasts up and straight.  2-3 lives and 6 continues isn't a great continue structure.  There seem to be checkpoints but they dont last through continues.  They did something cool.  There was an enemy about to attack me from above and to the right but they put him just high enough where if I did my high attack I got him.  It was well conceived.  The combat swinging is kind of like playing golf swinging his sword like that.  I like that.  the cave level made a big faux pas.  They put tons of little beasts at foot level.  When the lower attack isnt instant it shouldn't be used as a major mechanic.  Thats just taking advantage of the shortfalls of the controls to make things artifically difficult for the player.  I'm getting better at it though and its kind of a hadouken and its not so bad.  yay I made it through the cave!  Ok one really cool thing is when there are spikes on the ground walking into them doesnt hurt you it just stops you.  Thats fantastic!  Wow this is a really cool game!  I got pretty far for a game like this.  past the cave halfway through the next part to a little potion.  I decided to stop for now but I'm pleasantly surprised! 
* Micro Machines - this is great overhead racing mechanics.  I love the controls and the responsiveness of  the cars and the forgiveness of the track boundaries.  Is there shooting in this? I dont know.  Its definitely not overly hard (which is a good thing) on the first levels but I dont know what the continue structure is and suspect that its unforgiving on later levels and that you have to start over if you lose.  Ok I spoke too soon.  Level 2 the borders are completely unforgiving (you fall off the table) and there are erasers in the middle of the track that you can only avoid if youve been there before and if you go a little to far to avoid them  you fall off teh table.  
* McDonaldLand - hey the graphics and blitter effects here are great!  Theres even parallax.  The jumping looks funny and is floaty but just fine.  Its so fun and colorful.  I love the tilesets.  WHAT/ This asshole game just flung me back to the beginning of the level!  It wasnt a death just flipped me back here with a big fuck off!  So I run back and am sure to jump over it but what do you know just above it are some unobvious blocks which knock me straight into it.  It feels Kaizo.  well its cool that its got an overworld and that its not brutally hard.  I dont know what the continue structure is like but I'm not personally connecting or drawn in. lets see what the continue structure is.  Ok 3 hits and I'm dead but there is a cooldown invinicibility so that part is reasonably fair.  Hmm.  it just says 'press fire to continue' and puts me back at the beginning of the world.  I guess you get three lives to get through each world.  No passwords I dont think.  Well thats not terrible.  Betsy and me would definitely have spent a lot of time with this if we had had it.  In fact this might be the one we would have spent the most time with imho.  Theres a cd32 whdload patch and an infinite lives too.  its not co op but its trade off like mario 3.  Yeah I wish we had bought this one.  I didnt really know about it on Amiga but if I had I probably would have dismissed it as a kiddie game even though I secretly liked or loved the NES version because it wasnt so hard that you couldnt make progress.  
* Mickey Mouse The Computer Game - 1988 Gremlin - what is this? Is this a point and click adventure?   well no its not point and click but there are keys and item spots.  the controls are ok I guess but a bit slow the animation isnt great and theres a laser gun?  And wait is taht a minimap?  The music is primitive and annoying.  For some reason if you stand in one place for a second or two enemies spawn in and attack you.  Wow theres overhead modes too like gauntlet which change the game.  ALso youc an fall off platforms several stories down and have to redo those stories.  there are demons in the overhead modes.  wow.  They spawn from puddles of water and you throw hammers at them like in gauntlet.  The gauntlet mazes are real maze like there are only a few room configurations so its real easy to get lost.  This isn't nearly as bad as I initially judged it to be but I dont knwo what the point is or what to do at all.   haha one hit and 'you have failed to save disney castle'  ok.  well at least I got a top score?
* Mr Nutz - Ocean 1994 - Well the title screen is awesome with his huge face up there.  Wait is this a save game system in an Amiga platformer?  It looks like it!  It ignores the keyboard for typing but that can be forgiven.  I thought the button would advance a character but no it saved my name so my name is 'r,' haha.  Chickens from outer space oh no!  you have to go really far on the overworld to do anything or play any actual levels.  Wow when you actually start platforming the graphics are so big and colorful!  The sound is awesome too.  The controls are good but the acceleration is set so high that its difficult to go at any pace but fast.  The graphics are amazing.  I can tell its pushing the Amiga to its limits.  the other question is does the WHDLoad actually save your game?  When would it save it for me to know?  While its nice that you can cancel out the dialog boxes it would be best if it first filled them in completely and instantly instead of making you wait if you want to actually see what they said.  I like that you can recollect your hitpoints if you lose them. You find flags to actually play the game.  The overworld map is large and there are hitpoints to find on it but there arent actually many options of where to go.  Alright! Level 1 complete!  Well this was released late for Amiga games but Betsy and me would have had tons of fun with this even though it would have been hard to grapple with the controls.  Alright I beat the second level too! and I got a feather that lets me float a bit (flying squirrel I think).  It gives a decent number of 1ups after every level.  its a bit annoying because if you are 'flying' (which happens almost naturally on every jump) then you cant jump on enemies so you are vulnerable. One thing thats kind of terrible is the tiles sometimes blend together such that you cant tell whats background and foreground so your head hits ceilings when it should be empty space.  Theyre putting hidden enemies in bushes so you cant tell while youre going fast.  Its like some sonic levels where you coudl go fast but because theyve put dirty tricks in teh way you can.  Ok you  need a star to save your game and only at a red teleporter save point.  How do I get stars???  (looking it up)  Hmm it says after every level you can exchange yoru gems for stars.  Wtf I dont have any gems anymore and I dont remember being able to exchange for stars or anything anyway.  Well I give up.  This could be pretty good and I would have loved this as a kid even though I woudln't have known how to save.  Like mario World you cant just save willy nilly.  I woudl have had to figure that out somehow and would have eventually.  
* Mortal Kombat 2 - Cool options: You can do 2 button controllers, you can set it to very easy mode.  You can add up to 30 credits.  The title menus are a little bit simple and kind of make it look cheap.  the graphics are great.  Sure they're blocky and pixelated, and kind of grainy and the animation is a bit choppy, but honestly it still works.  its clear what they are supposed to be and it works.  Now the controls dont fare so well for me anyway I cant figure out how to survive for even one match.  I bet I could have eventually.  
* Midwinter 2 - 1991 Maelstrom games.  Wow this is Midwinter 2?  And this is 1991? omg the blimp ahd chopper intro is so cinematic and amazing!  Sure its heavily dithered but damn it works.  This is at real A1200 speed too.  Very impressive 3d.  This seems too complicated.  So many menus.  It seems like I'm progressing actually into the game but every menu isn't clear that I'm clicking the right thing sometimes it takes me back sometimes forward.  Goodness this takes forever to get into.  Wow the rainy stormy seas it started me out in the boat is freaking amazing.  I was able to move around (controls were way too floaty) and shoot some missiles but I was using joystick controls and didnt know how to land the boat or really aim the missiles.  It was pretty awesome seeing this level of atmospheric cinematic 3d in a game from 1991.   The dithering to get great 3d back then was really cool.
* LiveAndLetDie - This is a pretty cool game!  I was instantly having fun driving a boat down a river and shooting down other boats with missiles! I don't know how long that would last because I ran out of missiles and there were helicopters which I didnt know how to get to.  I bet there are other parts that aren't as polished but this part was pretty great for a few seconds.   
* Lethal Weapon - hey wow great graphics on the title screen.  1992 Ok I like the office environment a lot.  The graphics are clear and crisp pixel art.  Not trying to be too realistic.  Oh this is the overworld.  Yeah I love these grpahics.  oh wow there are reflection graphics too.  This is really cool.  Unfortunately the enemies ambush you from the side of the screen.  Ammo is limited which I think was a mistake even if it was more realistic it should have been reserved for a hard mode.  I love how you can attack melee if you are close.  the controls are really simple and i like that and they work well.  The jumping is a bit quick.  This style of pixel art is so good.  This is one of my favorite looking games on the amiga honestly.  It remind me of the best parts of Hoi but with more consistency maybe?  Ok a few lives down and its game over.  If thats the continue structure than this sucks.  yeah thats it.  I liked a lot about this game though and I feel like I could get further after a while.  I have this hope that if I beat a level I could continue from there but I dont have any evidence for that.  
* Moonwalker - Great music of course.  Michaels animations look awesome!  oh no the music is just the bad intro on loop and whats far worse, the loop is just *slightly* off.  And wtf is this??? If I liked the arcade or genesis game and bought this I would have been dumbfounded, pissed, and felt used and lied to.  This is some kind of one hit death overhead sneaking game or some shit!?!  This part reminds me of the first part of TMNT for NES but this is one hit death.  The enemies are bobblehead detectives or something?  omg.  Theres a time limit.  And you cant move nearly as fast as your enemy so if they get on screen they will chase you down and you die.  You cant attack them or slow them either.  Ok I got a key by following the blinky minimap.  OK and pushing the button runs a bit faster.  And if you are far along and you get hit you start over at the top left.  At least you get like 20 tries.  Wait I need to watch a video of this on youtube to see if I'm missing something.  This is by Ocean a major publisher.  Could they really get away with this???  the longplay is 31minutes.  Now I'm  intrigued because zeusdaz is saying the same things I did but he says the 8bit versions and st versions have chiptunes of the whole songs which is vastly better than a poorly looped sample.  This is so dramatically bad its hard to believe.  
* Pinball Fantasies - OMG I just realized something unbelievably amazing about this game and how it plays music.  Every time an important sound effect plays it pauses the music for dramatic effect but thats not all.  It doesn't just pick up the music where it left off.  It fucking rewinds it so you get to hear exactly what you missed!!!   Thats so bad ass.  This is one of my favorite games of all damn time.  We bought this brand new in the box off the shelf for $40 without having read a review or anything and it was one of the best decisions ever.  The WHDLoad version saves high scores and everything.  this is wonderful.  
* Neverending Story 2 - oh the intro is wonderful!  its like a book.  Now the music should have way more arpeggio like the pop song did.  I'm pretty sure the C64 version did.  Yup just checked.  its not bad but they were a bit lazy on this version.  Ok maybe I'm being a bit harsh since the C64 one was by the legend Martin Galway.  There is a password system here.  Even though I dont care for the limited lives I think its really cool that everytime you die a part of fantasia falls into the nothing.  Thats a great way of making your quest have weight.  The animation is ok for being so old, the pixel art is pretty cool.  The controls are pretty terrible.  Stairs simply shouldn't be hard. ever.  Castlevanias weird stairs was bad enough but I cant even start up these stairs.  Theres probably a trick but I don't know what it is and I shouldn't have to figure it out.  Stairs should not be a puzzle.  The jumping is pretty wild.  The baddies don't give you much time and no mercy.  Now I have some compassion for them since people were still trying to figure out how all of these things worked back then.  A small isolated team may never have played other games that did stairs much better, and even if they had they may not have known how to implement that or they may have been in a tight time constraint (typical for the day).  Regardless in 2019 it sucks.  Hmm longplays are 30min.  Ok so its worse.  I'm looking online and it doesnt seem that you even CAN go up the stairs!?!  Why in the world are they there if you cant use them.  Thats a neverending puzzle.  The strange gameplay of pushing these bad boys is a bit of a reminder of the oddities of the game out of this world.  
* Last Action Hero - Psygnosis 1994 - 11/7/19 Thats pretty late for an amiga game.  Lets see what its like.  The graphics are weird.  They're trying to be realistic and they sort of are.  They're good but also unclear and I guess I prefer clearer if more cartoony sprites.  Some of the details are great and the animation is smooth to a fault like its too smooth like so smooth and buttery that its slow.  the music is interesting its clearly trying to be heavy and it is and its impreseively realistic for a tracker song, but at the same time its a bit annoying.  The combat is cheap and clumsy but even so its a bit fun.  This is a beat em up like double dragon but cheaper but its not so cheap or non functional that its broken, just clumsy.  Its real cheap when you try to get off the ground.  It gets too hard too fast.  The enemy sprites move way faster than you and can go through you and have a much tighter hit box so you can easily attack around them with your slow attacks while they can get inside your range and hit you quick and knock you down even from a place where you cant hit them and you cant move while youre attacking but even if you coudl you couldn't move and then attack again fast enough to hit them before they knock you down and once youre down sometimes they wont let you get back up (cheap)  I actually like the fighting moves.  up to 5 lives (which is really kind of like 6 since they give you a life 0) and 3 difficutly levels (I was playing on easy) and 3 continues.  This is not a typical psygnosis game.  
* Mortal Kombat 2 1MB - 11/8/19 Even on Very Easy difficulty kung lao kicked my ass I couldnt get a punch in.  at least it has 2 button support and 30 credits.  I think I would have liked this and I think the graphics are really good on this one.  They didnt look entirely like the arcade but they werent washed out like I remember the other one from the other day
* Hybris - 11/8/2019 - I've heard so much about this game for so long.  1988 so it was a pretty early Amiga game.  I remember thinking that the screenshots didnt look that impressive and they dont but this is just one of those cases where it all comes together and feels so good.  Yeah thats good.  The music is fantastic and feels like a live recording.  The high score screen is totally bad ass with a cool blitter based 3d effect.  I got a high score!  Theres also some level of continuing which is awesome.  I wonder how many.  If unlimited then this is the best game on the system :) I got to the first boss but didnt beat him but I got the top score with 52000!.  Seems to be unlimited continues!  That makes this a king of games.  at a time when arcade games were king and every kid wanted the arcade experience at home this was one of the only games to actually bring it home.  Virtually no other games actually gave you unlimited continues like the arcade did.  It never made sense to me why they would artificially limit an arcade game for the home market when we paid.  We should absolutely get the arcade game with unlimited play but we never did.  Except this game.  A few others.  Hmm ... what others?
* Moonstone - 1991 Mindscape 11/8/2019 - I played this in 2017 I believe and it was really good.  The combat was interesting and I loved the multiplayer aspect.  Pugman plays on youtube has a great video about this game.  The atmosphere in this game is amazing and I feel like if I played it just a few more times I could beat it.  I gave it a good go before though.  This might be one that requires save states though.  Really cool animated intro.  Can you skip it?  doesnt seem like you can.  Created by Rob Anderson whos name is all over it.  its always nice to see the creators names like that.  So much pumping blood!  
* Lotus 3 - - 11/8/2019 Amazing title music.  Unforgettable and so futuristic.  I bought this at full price soon after it came out and the track editor was the coolest idea ever.  I just remember the single player campaign having an achilles heel.  I would try really hard to win and then I would get stuck on a level with a canyon on the side because any scrape against the wall and all of a sudden you slow to a crawl and everyone passes you.  It became no fun and I lost all of my lives orwhatever and had to start over.  it was so demoralizing to have a tiny almost unmissable error take down your whole hours of gaming and make you start again.   I never knew what the difference in the cars was but I bet it makes a big difference.   With the red esprit turbo I got an easy first place.  I liked the first race it had wide open track and was lots of fun.  the wind made it interesting too.  Its cool that you can adjust the radio between races, although its a bit too bad that you can't have music and sfx simultaneously.  One thing its missing: A minimap.  I feel like its sorely missing from this game too.  
* No Second Prize - - 11/8/2019 This was one of my favorite racing games of all time.  I played this a lot on my A600 and it was one of the first 3d games I ever played that had real 3d and moved really smooth.  The intro blew my mind back then and is cool even now with great smoothness and cool blitter backgrounds.  Great funky guitar exciting music too.  I was a sucker for cool character profile pics too and this had those too.  Plus the mouse controls were excellent and the season mode was deep and interesting and it wasnt so hard that I couldn't make progress. I could and did even if I never beat it.  This was fantastic.  Oh and it looks like you can save your game too! Well damn I was way out in front but I hit other bikes a bit too much and "totally crashed" losing the race.  I love the perspective and how it tilts.  I love how you can thread the needle between two other bikes and since they are really skinny you can scoot trhough unscathed.  I love taking sharp corners on my knee.  I love overtaking positions on corners.  Ilove how you dont have to slow down that much to take a sharp corner just right.  I love how its not a game where you're trying to dodge the tricky AI thats just trying to get in front of you (although there is certainly some of that).  This is a masterpiece.  I played on mouse sensitivity 3 which was great.  Oh and its got a minimap which even lotus 3 doesnt have and which is sorely missing imho
* Lemmings CDTV - 11/9/2019.  Wow the intro to this is so damn good.  Its so clear and well animated and fun.  and the colors and dithering are smooth as butter.  This CDTV version has 2 player mode and the WHDLoad has level select which if I remember correctly was password based back in the day.  It says on the title there are 120 one player levels and 20 2 player levels but you can only select 30 levels from the menu or the codes that come with it.  Theres a way to pause but  wasnt there a way to speed them up?  Well I figured it out there are 30 levels but 4 difficulties (=120) With that in mind I have this feeling we actually beat all 30 levels on fun mode at least which is quite an achievement imho.  I think we got halfway through the game iirc.  Ok I beat level 1 and since its got a password system I think this is a great continue structure.  I think I was snobbish about password systems back then and I have a memory of writing down the passwords in the back of the manual but then later not wanting to play the game because "ugh I would have to type in that really long password just to continue, its not even worth it" haha.  If only I knew.  The music is great and iconic and brings back memories right away.  The second level music did for sure.  This is a great game. 
* Lemmings Files (dont know why its called files) - 11/9/2019 this recognized my memory expansion and showed the psygnosis logo which I dont think the CDTV version did.  Exactly teh same intro and title screen.  
* Llamatron 1MB - - 11/9/2019This is one of the best shareware games I ever played.  I loved it so much.  I played it with my dad when we had two atari joysticks duct taped together to do the dual stick controls.  he did shooting and I did moving or vice versa.  That was very fun and a great memory.  We did it a lot for a while.  I love the incredible samples and how they are used to perfect effect.  I love the sprites which are drawn so clear and crisp.  I love the style which has character out the ass.  I love that it keeps a lot of high scores.  I love that it has a cool story.  I love that the collision detection is pixel perfect (although I feel like if it had let the llamas head get ignored it would have been more kind and a bit more fun) I love all of the powerups you can play with.  I got a high score of 76799 on my first game with single stick controls.  I think it even gives you a drone if you select it.  x or one of the keys seems to quit to the menu from in the game.  I love that it fires up the game without any drama.  I love the variety of enemies.  I love the idea that you are saving all of the beasties.  Its so good and one of the best games on the system or of the day.  Especially I love the feel of the hitting of the enmies and their consequent explosions.  it feels refined to perfection.  It blows my mind that he did all of this in assembly.  I dont remember how to activate dual stick mode nor do I know how to get it working with an xbox controller with uae.  I have a feeling that UAE is a bit too 'smart' for some of that to work.  You know whats cool, when you die you dont have to beat those enemies again.  Coded on devpac developer.  I do wish there were more levels with a lower difficulty.  It does seem to cut off the bottom of the screen which I can probably fix with a pal NTSC setting of some sort.  Lets see if it saves high scores:  YES It does!!!  Ok to play dual stick mode: Press fire on the 2nd stick instead of the first.  
* Llamatron 512KB - - 11/9/2019I always wondered what the difference was I knew a little about MBs but didnt know why it mattered or why he would name two versions of the game like that.  I played a level and I think it just didnt have quite the extravagant sound samples.  Maybe thats the only difference?    
* Midwinter -- 11/9/2019 I bought this with Starglider 2 and something else but I basically never played it.  I think I remember firing it up but not having any idea what to do.  haha with it in Super speed mode it renders a thousand things and runs out of time in 5 seconds or less.  This was rumored to be a legendary game.  Wow it does make you feel like a spy.  The skiing is really cool!  I didnt figure anything else out and kept getting shot by an airplane with awesome 3d graphics which even dropped bombs on me and then shot me (which its pretty incredible I survived even one shot).
* Megaball 11/10/19.  This is version 4.0 which I didnt have.  I actually sent off for the shareware and remember getting the letter in the mail with the floppy disk in it and some documents.  it had a level editor with it which I imagined using to make entirely new level sets (never did) but I did make a few levels with it for fun including a really easy one :) I remember it being v1.2 or v2.0 or thinking that v2.0 was way in the future or something.  I bet I can find the exact version on a fish disk (which I'm quite sure is where I got it in the first place). Whoa the levels are totally different but the sprites and sounds are the same.  The levels are explosive and more interesting but also they're not what I remember (and I would like to play the levels I remember for fun). I would like to get the shareware version that I had.  Regardless this is such a good game.  The controls are perfect and sound effects and sprites make it feel polished to a sheen and the powerups keep it really interesting.  You know what they pull the powerups away a frame or two too edaerly at the bottom of the screen.  The sprites are so polished and beautiful I always thought they looked wonderful.  theres some new music for high score screen and part of the title screen.  Now I didnt get to hear any in game music (its a powerup but its so good).  The player 1 high score graphic looks washed out to me, I dont remember it being like that.  Top score!  Rip 6136!  Lets see if it saves high scores?  also it says I can hit c to continue.  I remember something about that and I'm glad it lets you continue.  I think that was an important part of why I liked it because I think it has unlimited continues.  OH!  You can load the original boards!  This was like 1995 and it says "Grab your browser and look for IAMs world wide web site"  haha oh cool the music was made in OctaMED!  YES!  i found the original boards!  OH!  The original first level is actually pretty hard.  There is an unlimited lives WHDLoad cheat.  I remember the first time the music started playing in game it was incredible.  It made the whole game so exciting because of the quality of those mods. Update: They made the latest music available on bitbucket so Ive got all of the music as they claim but I'm not hearing the original tracks.  Nope they're not here.  
* Megaball 1MB 11/10/19 - This is the same afaik.  Probably plays title screen music and preloads more songs or something.  
* Megaball AGA 11/10/19 - Lets see how different this one looks.  Well there is more flashiness on the title screen.  More color backgrounds for teh powerups.  The title screen music almost sounds like they remixed the original mods.  If so I dont care for them.  Ok well all of the gradients are slightly clearer the paddle has clearer gradients anyway and there is more flashiness in the blocks and more of a jewel look as well as more colors overall.   I dont really care and it doesn't hearken back to what I remember so I'll stick with the non-aga. 
* Lemmings 2 The Tribes 512K 11/10/19 - I remember playing and totally loving a demo of this game.  "Tell me again storykeeper tell me of the prophecy?"  The story sets up a cool background to make you want to complete all the levels to beat the game.  "The guide who saved us before" (looks at screen).  Wow the backgrounds and graphics are amazing in this!  Theres so much variety and cool parts.  theres fast forward int his one!  The music is great too.  I'm playing the space levels at the moment.  I got an A!  Whoa there are loads of cool powers in this game.  
* Lemmings 2 The Tribes 1MB 11/10/19 - Lets see what the difference is with the 512K version.  	You know the other one mentioned that it had seen a memory expansion. I wonder if it was running the 1mb version?  nope it had another upgraded ram marker even.  Now I'm playing the beach levels (which are probably more basic than the space levels afaik).  I dont know what the difference is frankly.  I thought they were the same.  Still this is a good game with cool graphics and sound and gameplay.  I got 1st place!!!  Lets see if save/load works ... Yup it worked fantastic.  
* Lemmings Holiday 1994 - 11/10/19 - This is fun.  Its obviously the exact lemmings 1 engine but its pretty cool that they released these free packs at holidays times.  I beat the first level even though it didnt give me many extra resources.  The music is awesome and original to these packs.  IJRLDNCCCP
* Lemmings Holiday 1993 - 11/10/19 - I love teh 'oh no' sound and the pixel particles that go flying.  That was probably my first experience with particles and even though I never thought about it much I loved them.  
* Nebulus 1987 - 11/10/19 - I remember playing this or a pirated copy or maybe on the C64 or probably a shareware clone and i loved it so much probably just because of the graphics, but Ive watched a full playthrough by zeusdaz and the difficulty and fairness on this is shit.  Lets give it a shot though.  The graphics are actually really good. Ok I walked to the right and the third block I stepped on fell out with no warning and that was my last life and my game is over.  What a piece of shit (in those regards).  I dont even know what the controls.  The garphics are fantastic though especially teh water blitter effect.  So crisp and clear and the rotating technology is so damn cool.  
* Nebulus 2 - 11/10/19 - This is interesting because this is exactly teh same engine.  I thought it would be different, and it is because it looks like there are powers and keys and things in this one, but the graphics are identical (not a problem just an observation).
* Nightbreed The interactive movie - 11/10/19 - I had this (or the action game I dont know which) but basically never played it.  "Your life is about to change"  the animations are awesome.  Ok it was this one based on the cover.  I cant figure out how to do anything at all.
* Nightbreed - 11/10/19 The action game. Graphics are cool with the prologue on a scroll.  The background is pretty awesome.  Oh wow I think it is meant to have you play the other game before this one because it seems like it gives spoilers to the other one in the prologue of this one.  The background is deep with lots of text.  Damn the mouse cursor is epic!  The action is pretty terrible.  Plus its one of these games which attempted to do 3d in 2d by making you go up and down through doors.  This is not something I think almost anyone can get into their heads, or at least it doesn't come naturally and certainly isnt a common enough paradigm for people to get good at it.  I wonder if there were any really good games that used this paradigm?  Now onto the next letters OPQ
* PGATourGolf - 11/10/19 - I figured something out.  It is going to be unlikely that I am going to enjoy or want to keep playing any deep games from back then.  Amiga RPGs are probably not going to be something I sink my teeth into.  I definitely still want to play them, it doesnt change that.  Whoa!  Rob Hubbard music??  Nice!  I'm in the well illustrated pro shop.  One cute thing is they hadn't entirely figured out user interfaces like we have today so even opening menus in this is counterintuitive.   Its 3d with low frame rate and billboard trees.  The shooting interface, map, and physics are good.   One thing I really like is the 3d terrain map of the green.  It looks great and lets you move around to see what its like in detail (albeit at about 1fps).  I think this is the easiest golf game I've played to just start playing and have fun.  YAY I got it in the hole!!! 9 on a par 4.  Mark O'Meara gave me tips as the 2 frames per second 3d expanded to full screen.  I hit this one pixel perfect!  WOW Then near the green I hit it off of the pin and it went bonk!  I GOT PAR!!! Now Fuzzy Zoeler is giving me tips.  
* Plan 9 from Outer Space -  Well its a point and click first person.  The window is small but totally workable.  Wow the animation is pretty incredible when for just one scene they have animated a woman walking across the restaurant to the phone.  "She is actually a He but he seems friendly" Nice for 1990 or so!  Interesting mostly dialogue based adventure.  The graphics were great and the story was weird. I bet this could have been pretty good.  I didnt see a save game though.   
* PLayer Manager 1990 11/10/19 - Written by Dino Dini?  wow!  This has the GOAL! Pointer!  It generates the environment randomly.  Which actually takes a really long time.  Then when you play a match it goes through and simulates whats happening in the match.  You select tactics (and I have no idea what that means) and assign players to positions.   Wow its really cool seeing the pixels playing a match really fast.  I really like this!  I really didnt think I would omg!! its so cool!  the sound fx are great too.  Wow this is really cool!  like 3 minutes ago I was pretty sure I would think this game sucked because I was thinking it would be too complicated, and I'm sure it will be too complicated to do a really good job managing, but its so easy to get into and so fun to see what happens!  Lets see if saves work.  Yes they do!  This is a real winner. 
* Player Manager 2 1995 ANCO 11/10/19.  Now if I remember correctly Dino Dini left anco around 1990and sure enough hes not on the credits on the first screen of this game.  This absolutely has none of his charm or stamp on it and I have my doubts about the quality here.  Lets see what happens.  I'm impressed with the depth and realism.  The graphics are digitzied or rendered and look great.  The rooms are well represented and it makes sense generally what they are for, although it also represents some things I dont understand and dont really want to get into.  You know theres a baseball management sim called out of the park for modern systems that I've been tempted to get (in fact I think I bought one verison in a bundle or something) but I have little to no interest in getting into a deep complex game like that at this point.  Wow you can watch this from 4 perspectives which means they programmed in the graphics from all of those perspectives.  I bet that took them a while but I don't know how much value it has for the quality of the game.  Lets see if its as fun to watch thi smatch.  To be fair I didnt put this on fast forward mode.  Ok the graphics from perspective mode are ok but dont have any of the charm of player manager one or kick off or goal.  wait whats this??? You play a player in the game??? WTF?  
* POlice Quest 1987 Sierra 11/10/19.  The music is a bit like dragnet.  Oh this is one of those that looks no better than a C64 game?  wow.  At least you can speed it up a lot because at normal speed its painful.  
* Police Quest 2 1990 Sierra 11/10/19 - Well I LOVE the 80s themed graphics on the title screen!  Graphics much better but still like a port from low color dos or Apple.  
* Police Quest 3 11/10/19 - Graphics more realistic than the second one.  Really cool credits sequence with awesome silohuettes and digitized animations.  composer jan hammer?  WOW thats cool!  Its up to you to follow correct police procedure to make the right decisions.  Its designed by a police officer.  He made the game based on some of his real experiences.    It does seem that you can save at any point which is a blessing.  The whole presentation makes it like a movie.  The graphics are completely washed out (probably because its a rough port) the guy is animated well though and turns in many different subtle directions.  
* Pool of Radiance 1990.  A forgotten realms epic.  SSI and Ubi Soft.   11/10/19 - This was always in the back of my mind as one of the coolest games ever made.  I actually never knew anything about it and know next to nothing now, except that I wanted to experience the fantasy it had on offer for myself.  Whoa UBISoft?  nice.  Iconic graphics on the first screen.  I dont like the text font because its not too readable, otoh its a great fantasy font.  Ok so its like bards tale in some ways.  I didnt get into any battles, but it was responsive even on my 2x amiga.  Lets see about my slower amiga.  Ok its pretty responsive still.  You just have to finish moving before pressing another movement key.  Ahh I got int a battle and the battle is this strategy overhead isometric thing.  I have no idea how to do this.  This doesn't look at all fun to me because I don't believe I can stay in the fantasy with all of these confusing long battle interruptions (not unique to this game of course).  
* Quest for Glory - 11/10/19  The graphics here are so clumsy, but still pretty cute actually.    This is like the other sierra games but with RP.
* Quest for Glory 2 - 11/10/19 - Weird this looks like its exactly the same engine with zero improvements.  Actually it looks a bit slower d'oh!  One disconcerting thing is whenever you try to select from the menu the music stops.  well ok its apparently going to stop anyway so not that big of a deal. 
* Premier Manager 1992 Gremlin - 11/10/19  I love the text font.  Whoa you can sell advertising on the boards on your grounds?  amazing!    Nice subtle touch is the mouse buttons visibly click on the mouse pointer in the game.   This one is different.  the simulation is just some animations and while it shows shots its not at all like seeing the game simulated.  its choppy frames.  Nothing wrong with it just totally different than player manager.   
* Premier Manager 2 1993 Gremlin - 11/10/19 - The fonts are clearer this time around.  This looks like they made everything slicker and even more interesting.  
* Premier Manager 3 1994 Gremlin - 11/10/19 - I think all three of these use the exact same engine.
* Phantasie 3 The wrath of Nikademus - 1987 - OMG it tells you what parts of theri bodies are gone or broken.  thats incredible.  I like the sprites and colors which are clear and crisp.  They did a good job.  And this was 1987.  I didnt play this but I played the first 2 on C64 and loved parts of them.  Wait maybe not.  I think I WANTED to play those two but they didnt load or something.  :(  I think they removed my fighters left arm!  Holy shit!  Oh no his other arm is off too!  hes dead!   Torsos and heads can be removed.  Survivors get the gold and experience.  
* Pirates! 1990 - the graphics are great.  Clearly drawn for the Amiga.  its cool how much background they give you.  Its cool you can do fencing and go to different ports, and have cannon battles!  I think I played a more recent game like this in like 2013?  
* Pirates! Gold CD32 - I did it I won a fencing match!  The enemy pirate captain surrendered!!!  
* Phantasie 1987 SSI - Ok this city scape I remember from C64.  You have to assemble a group in the guild.  Whoa teh overworld graphics!  So funny looking. Looks like old MSPaint.  But really you dont need more than this.  Ok its just my one person party against a spider demon thing.  Uh oh I dont think I have a weapon.  omg the controls are impossibly painful.  Mouse to go to a menu and then to fight. Then you have to click on fight in the middle of the screen every time you want to attack.  ugh.  The mouse moves far too fast
* Paladin 1988 - Did I have this game? Why do I know about this?  It wasnt in amiga addict.  I dont remember playing it.  The graphics are funny and super simple.  You had to do soem tricks to even start the game.  I guess it reminds me of the simplicity of Breach.  Yup same dev.  Cant even finish one turn.
* Paladin 2 - 11/10/19 - Ok I like the movement much better in this one.  Oh no they killed one of my guys and its playing sad music!  This is a much better game imho.  
* Pacific Islands 1992 Empire - 11/10/19 - Cool intro music and graphics that draw you in.  Damn this is complicated where I need to go.  I dont know how to go all of those places or do all of those things.  Whoa this is so cool!  All four viewpoints are four different tanks and you can aim each independently in 3d.  Thats pretty bad ass and high tech imho.  
* The Pawn 1986 Magnetic Scrolls - 11/10/19 Great intro screen art digitized.  I had guild of thieves on C64 but not this one.  oh wow I love the interface.  You can save anytime.  You can even select hints from the menu at any time.  I like that very much and feel like I might be able to get further in this more organically than any other text adventure on the Amiga.  The text is clear and readable and the whole thing is high resolution.  
* Questron 2 1988 - 11/10/19 I like the intro very much.  The graphics are awesome imho.  cute and clear and even slightly isometric.  What i remember best about this game and its predecessor on C64 is that I could actually make progress in these where most other RPGs I couldn't get anywhere.  I remember gambling to make lots of money, and I remember something about thieving stores but then getting in trouble with the guards.  The graphics are functional and clear.  Hey I gambled and won 10 gold!  In this game its such a simple portrayal of all of the parts of a city but it totally works.  I like that there are lots of cities.  It makes the overworld feel more alive than lots of other RPGs.  The combat is so simple and takes place on the overworld and I think thats a huge part of why I liked this game. Even if its turn based it doesnt take my attention away from where I am on the overworld map and what I was doing there.  Virtually every other game takes that attention away by sending me into a battle in a zoomed in situation of some sort.  My brain doesnt work so clearly on getting back into what I was doing but in this game it does.  I love this for that reason alone and wish I had spent more time with it as a kid.  It seems to have locked up but thats a winner for sure.  
* Populous World Editor - Its really cool to see how each of the tiles is represented in their raw graphics format.  I love to see this.  You can actually change the sprites.  Its a sprite editor.
* Populous - 1989 Bullfrog 11/10/19 Wow the tiles falling from the sky is an amazing intro.  and with them bouncing its so cool!  I remember really loving this game.  I got pretty far too.  I remember my cousin coming over and bursting my bubble because I showed it to him thinking it was the coolest game and then he (who i thought highly of his opinion) said that it wasnt that interesting and he didnt know really what the goal was so there wasnt much of a reason to keep playign so it got boring quick.  for my 15 year old brain that was a tragic blow and as much as it shouldn't have it changed my impression of the game and I hardly came back to it after that.  I recently played a modern clone called Reprisal Universe and it was pretty cool and played great but it got so hard after 6h that I couldn't get anywhere anymore.  
* Populous II - 1991 Bullfrog 11/10/19 Actually I think it was this game that I really spent the time with.  I might have had the first one but I'm quite sure I had this one.  Oh theres a password system wiht this one also a save and load system?  I played this on my A600 and I can't imagine how slow it must have been but I didn't know any better and it was fine to me.  Its cool how you can scroll with the numpad too but it occurs to me that the A600 didnt have that so I must have been scrolling with the minimap or with the arrows.  
* Omega 1989 Origin - 11/10/19 - I owned this and it had a big manual and I remember always thinking I would get deep into this and figure it all out, and then later thinking I should get good at it to make myself a better programmer.  I always had a feeling of regret or shame at not figuring this game out.  There was always so much baggage with it though.  The retina scan was cool, but that was part of the baggage since it was such a big deal to get into the game just to play even if only for a few minutes.  And it takes a long time tooo.  Ok you can save your simulation design and then hopefully you can program your tanks.  There was a BBS with Omega tanks on it but I never got to login to it before it was gone.  I thought it would be there forever and took it for granted, when really it might have never been there for one day after I bought it since I didnt buy the game until several years after it came out.  Alright I didnt program a new tank or anything but I did kick off a simulation and the tank is moving around and scanning its environment and then moving accordingly.  Oh damn its about to encounter another tank and its shooting at it!  sweet!  Ok hopefully I can load some of these other peoples tanks that are online, and even though I cant see the source code (without the clever disassembler that someone has out there) I can see some really cool tank battles.  The intro to the game is amazing.  I'm really getting into this right now.  Now it makes me want to make a binary or source compatible game like this.  Yes! It was trivial to load new tanks into the game.  This is so cool.
* Ports of Call 1989 - 11/10/19 - I always wanted to have this game and play it a lot and get good at it.  I always wanted to play it with other people because its kind of a board game.  Wow Full color digitized art of the authors.    The intro is awesome.  well it is nice that it lets you pick the desired playing duration.  You can play 4 players too! Hey I got my boat to go from san francisco to japan with a load of stuff.  I almost crashed when landing my boat (which I could have had the tug do it) but I fear-quit early.  
* Pac-Mania - 11/11/19 I always loved this game so much, but I never played it on Amiga 1988.  WhDLoad has help for unlimited lives.  Alright !I beat level 1 without losing any lives and with 4 lives left.   The graphics are excellent.  The ghosts dont look too 3d but thats ok because man does and all of the levels are awesome.  oh I forgot you could jump! 
* Putty - 11/11/19 1992 System 3 - Unlimited lives in WHDLoad.  I remember having a demo of this and i loved it.  I think it was the graphics that completely won me over.  The sprites and backgrounds are all so crystal clear nd beautiful.  I like the first level because it shows you exactly what to do.  oh no.  The collision with platforms isn't perfect. :( I don't htink its clumsy just not quite what it should be.  So on the first level you get a feel for what they have done to you in this game.  Theres a jump which requires you to be within 2 pixels of the edge perfectly timed.  Thats just in the tutorial mode.  I already dont like the difficulty curve, but I wonder what the continue structure is like.  The controls are weird.  Push left and it takes a half a second to start moving left.  Jump is pretty much instant though.  I just dont know about this.  Ic oudlnt figure out how to jab.  
* Out Run USGOld 11/11/19 (says Sega on the title screen but has digitized voice "US GOld Present from Sega" and some really annoying mod omg.  Nothing like the great out run music.  ok now the out run music is back! The frame rate of everything in the game is absolutely terrible.
* Out Run Sega 11/11/19 This is exactly the same but with a slightly different digitized voice at the beginning amongs the horrible intro music.  We really didnt need any more music that then the classic tracks.  The frame rate is so bad that you can't know whats coming up.  The sprites are ok.  
* Out of this world 11/11/19 - The whdload is actually called another world.  of course this is the same game effectively.  Oh yeah theres a password system in this game.  Damn the animation is smooth.  I keep forgetting that.  Couldnt figure out how to skip the intro.
* Oh No MOre lEmmings 11/11/19.  Password system?  Alright I beat level 1!  You know I think I prefer the classic lemmings gameplay to the lemmings 2 yes there is a password!
* Prince of Persia 11/11/19 1990 I always wanted to beat this, but never really got to play it.  I loved the later games in the series so much and got way into them.  I beat the sands of time and the 2007 one Prince of Persia and loved them both.  I remember the sands of time having the coolest cinematic storybook ending.  Wow this is super cinematic and the animation is amazing.  If I had bought this it woudl have blown my mind.  The colors and graphics are great.  damn you only have one hour?  Ok lets see how this plays.  Wait do you get unlimited retries?  It would be cool to map this out.   It looks like its got a decent continue structure.  I like this way more than I ever thought I would.  bitd I lumped this in with dark castle and I feel like I played both on Dusts mac.  but this is much better.  
* Pinball Dreams 11/11/19.  I remember reading in the magazines that this was great, but it definitely didnt grab my attention with the screenshots, however Pinball Fantasies in the pink box on the wall at ComputerWise sure did grab my attention.  Fantasies is better and much more polished with more mature and better designed tables (and by the same team) but this is good.   I actually had this for a while for iOS but I dont know where it went unfortuntely.  For a while I remember this beign avaiable but fantasies wasnt and taht was sad.  Well it plays fantastic!  doesn't have anything to offer over fantasies, and in fact feels like it is designed around older less sophisticated machines
* Pinball Illusions AGA 11/11/19 - I wouldn't have gotten this bitd because its AGA.  Dreams and Fantasies were both 1992.  This was 1995 apparently.  Same team I believe.  Wow this actually feels much higher tech.  Its got more tilt buttons for more subtle tilting and the physics are way tighter.  WHOA You can zoom in and out too!  I really like this one.  
* Pinball mania - 11/11/19 same publisher different dev team.  lets see if its any good.  I immediately dont like the style of the covers for each of the tables.  they look childish comparatively.  The marquee is almost unreadable.  ugh the ball movement is terrible imho.  the polish just isnt there
* pinball prelude aga - this has zero polish its completely different. it looks all futuristic sort of but unrealistic too and with rendered graphics that are cool but make it cluttered and busy.  I havent played it but already dont like it.  Well its better than mania.
* Pinball Illusions CD32 I couldn't figure out how to control the damn thing.  Enter to launch the ball but how did cd32 players do it?  Maybe the enter key was mapped to one of the buttons?  I dont know.  
* Ork - Psygnosis - I like the psygnosis logo on this game better than most of their other logos.  Whoa thats a cool intro.  Whoa I love these graphics especially the main character.  These sprites RULE!  This must have been the SOTB team.  The parallax is awesome too. The sounds are great. The controls aren't broken but the platforming is certainly frustrating.  interesting.  If you lose your power (which is easy since sometimes you'll wind up on top of an enemy and neither of you can move fast enough for them to not constantly drain you to death.  note to self always use post hit invincibility) you get asked to continue (unlimited???) and you start right where you left off.  Ok I got a key but then got to something that says 'pay toll' and I dont know what that means.  I think I really really like this game.  
* Qix - Taito 1989 (also 1981?  Wow thats early!)  Alright! I beat level 1.  I got 67% out of required 65%.  The graphics are good and the controls are good.  Its pretty cheap since it gets so much faster on level 2.  
* Paradroid 90 - Andrew Braybrook Graftgold 1990.  I've heard of this game many times but never played it.  Apparently this was a C64 game of great renown.  Whoa that logo is AWESOME!!!  Great blitter graphics!  I like that it calls loading the level 'retrieving first ship blueprints'  The static when you die is awesome. The presentation here is incredible!  whoa one life and youre back to the title screen?  I hardly even got hit!?!  great subtle details like going up to the terminal in the corner on the first screen and the monitors light up and illuminate the desk by your droid.  Hmm.  I see great potential here. The presentation is incredible.  I dont know what to do or how to survive though and it seems brutally and unfairly difficult.  I like the exploration aspect though.  I love the graphics all around, but I can see why I wouldn't have thought much of it in screenshots becuase its hard to tell what is what when its not moving since the style is so persistent.  
* Outrun Europa 11/11/19 - USGold.  zeusdaz says usgold suck and thats pretty much been my experience too.  This game is stupid.  Its a motorcycle game with like police chase and a porsche that wont let you pass.  wtf???  Well at least the frame rate is fine and the control is workable.  
* Pool 1987 Mastertronic 11/11/19- The company card is a cool 3d effect.  it sucks compared to archer macleans.  
* Predator 1987 - Well I dont know its not terrible.  The shooting is ok but I run out of bullets so easy.  The predator hunting sequence where the symbol appears is pretty cool and creepy.  The birds should definitely not do any damage.  
* Predator 2 1988 - 11/11/2019 whoa Konami?  Oh!  This is like a shooter game with the mouse.  I might actually like this!  Especially with some extra lives. Music or sfx not both. The continue structure is absurd. Theres no way to not take damage but it gives you one continue.  I got a few minutes in and it was fun for that time.  The sprites were great and the shooting was pretty fun.   
* Pong 1992 Claudio Buraglio Public Domain well its pong.  There are four modes and it plays great.  several two player modes included I think made for 2 mice.  
* Popeye 2 - 1992 11/11/2019 - gosh I dont know about this.  Traps everywhere, unclear what you can collect and stand on, clunky controls.  No goal.  Dirty tricks when thinks hit you from out of nowhere.  This is no fun.
* Psycho Santa - Bullfrog Shareware for $5.50?  wow!  so weird. The sprites were cool and the snow was cool. The big reaper was cool and I destroyed him with snowballs, but I dont know what to do and I died.
* Primal Rage AGA 1995 - Ok the graphics are pretty good.  They're obviously digitized and scaled down so they are a bit grainy and washed out, but its not a problem.  Just like MK.  I have no idea how to control it, it says it was 2 button but I didnt see it do anything when I pressed the 2nd button.  At least it lets you set a super low difficulty.  10 is normal. 1 is easiest.  10 continues.  I feel kind of sad for fighting games on the Amiga.  I have found virtually no good ones.  Many people say IK+ and Barbarian and I can see that.  Others say Body Blows, but someone is going to have to show me why that one is even ok.  I had it on PC and enjoyed it for what it was worth.  Capital punishment horrible, SF2, ok, I watched a video that suggested that one of the SF2 games was pretty amazing, alpha maybe?  MK ok, MK2 ok, but without multiple buttons I dont know how to control any of them and its honestly sad for me.  I think multiple buttons is one of two things that held the amiga back from being modern past 1991 (when SNES made 6 (or at least many more than 2) buttons somewhat standard).  It doesnt seem at first like that big of a deal but when theres so much functionally that a dev wants to do with a game but the user has no discrete clear simple and reliable (works instantly every time) way of executing those commands ... #gametheory.
* Puffys Saga UBISoft 1989.  11/11/19 Theres a level select of some sort which sounds great.  The intro screen is a bit crappy but thats ok.  its also pretty old.  One cool thing you can be male or female.  Ok so its like gauntlet.  Its got a silly aesthetic but its got most of the features of gauntlet.  Problem: Shooting doesnt seem to damage enemies!?!  Problem: I got to level 2 and died.  Why tf did I restart at level 1?
* Pacland 1989 11/11/2019 - WHDLoad has infinite lives.  Well I remember looking into this a year or two ago and found that it has some real groundbreaking redeeming qualities.  I have no idea what they are right now.  It looks like MS Paint and plays like a brick.  He moves fast but theres no control and I have no idea what is going on.  Worst I died on round 3 and instantly started back on round 1.  
* Paperboy 1989 Elite - 11/11/19 - Well I never liked this in the arcade maybe because it wasn't discrete enough for me.  But I dont like it here, although the graphics are good for what they are and the controls were fine for paperboy.  
* Paperboy 2 tengen mindscape 1992 - 11/11/19 - maybe this is a bit better. I got a paper in the box.  A dog attacked me though.  I dont get this game. 
* Operation Wolf - 11/11/19 WHDLoad has light gun support?  Wow thats freaking amazing.  It says it has with or without the white flashing.  OH shit I LOVE the font in this game.  its beautiful and 80s and so crisp.   I'm on my slowest amiga 4000 and it ran way too fast.   On my slowest a1200 it was ok speed, but it was a big mess of getting hit with no chance of not getting hit. Like predator 2 above I think but that was better.  Not bad just messy. It comes with notes about making a light gun adapter for the sega master system phaser.  
* Parasol Stars 1992 Ocean - 11/11/19 The story of rainbow islands 2.  Well it plays well for what it is but I feel like its stupid and not fun.  
* pit fighter - 1991 Tengen I always wanted this game so bad just due to the graphics alone.  I got a record KO in 36 sec!  The combat is shitty, the sprite scaling is cool, and it does seem pretty gritty environment and fighting, but its really hard to tell what you're doing or to do it right and the enemy attacks too quick.  
* Pipe Dream - Lucasfilm 1989 - I always wanted this after I first played it on Davids PC (I think it was his) which I remember being an AT&T PC which I thought was weird but hey.  Oh cool theres a password system!  It works ok but its a bit clunky and not that fun atm.  
* Platoon - 1988 11/11/19 There are some cool WHDLoad level selects.  Its so shit.  Whether you do nothing or not you get shot from behind the instant the game starts.  Theres probably something you can do to avoid that but if it starts out in moment 1 being cheap as hell then its just going to get worse.  
* Power Drift - 11/11/19 I actually dont remember this and don't know why I picked it.  There are a lot of characters and thats interesting.  The logo is awesome. 1988/89 activision oH ITS THIS game!  this is a pretty colorful heavily sprite scaled racing game that I never liked.  I think I have this on my 3ds on a sega collection.  on here its a mess and I couldn't figure out teh controls.  
* Project X - 1992 Team 17.  WHDLoad Level Select.  11/11/19  The minute I saw this in the magazines I had to have it.  I wanted it so bad and I wanted to love it and be good at it so bad.  However ... they said it was hard but I didnt know what that meant back then.  What hard means back then is in part shitty cheapness and unfairness.  I would have bought it and gotten no where at all.  I'm glad I didnt, but its sad that this wasnt more fair because I would have loved it so much if it had been.  lEts try it now.  I might try rookie mode but I am aware that sometime sin Team 17 games (assassin) that means you can only get a half way through the game.  At least you can save and load high scores.  Its even got a start level in the main menu.  Its so cool.  The sprites are amazing.  the shooting is pretty good.  I cant survive more than 30 seconds which makes this shit.
* Project X Special Edition 93 - Team 17 11/11/19.  I heard that somehow this was harder than the original. :( You know I'm not sure this is actually the SE.  This seems identical except you start with a vertical gun too.  
* Project X V2 - 1992 Team 17 11/11/19 Well this seemed 100% the same but I selected the heavier ship and got a bit further. I got to the first boss but I couldn't bea thim.  
* Pushover 1992 Ocean - 11/11/19 - some nice WHDLoad cheats available.  This is about an ant? The animation is pretty silly.   I dont know what to do and this isnt fun.  is it apuzzle game?  
* Putty Squad AGA - System 3 11/11/19 - Hey theres a password system here.  oh wow the putty moves vastly smoootehr in this game.  quick and responsive.  one hit death. Well I love the punching the enemies.  its satisfying.  Ok this isn't bad at all.  I think if I ahd this as a kid I would have liked it and played it quite a bit.  I admit that I never really got good with up to jump but I would have made some progress and figured out how to select the items you absorb and probably would have beat a few levels and spent several fun hours with it.  
* Risky Woods - EA 11/11/19 I loved the look of this game and absolutely would have loved to own it and would have played the hell out of it (or so I think) I played the genesis version a few years back and enjoyed it but it was super hard and I think I used rewind a lot.  I think this was also known as wolfchild which is how I knew it.  Great graphics sprites and backgrounds.  I love it so far!  Except a super cheap huge bolder from out of nowhere that you have to know is coming.  Ok so its good.  real good. However ... its cheap too, but not in the typical ways.  Theres enough time to beat the level, unless you get an apple which you would think is a bonus but its poisoned and you sleep and lose time and life.  or unless you get the arrows which look like a powerup until they take you back in the level.  or unless you stand in the wrong place and get pummelled with fireballs.  I didnt beat the first level but I think I could.  I unlocked an eye gate with an eye key by pressing space, but I died after that and the eye gate 100% should have been a checkpoint.  regardless I like it, its fun, and I should have bought it as a kid.  I would have had fun.  
* Red Zone - 1992 Psygnosis - whoa the intro is so bad ass.  11/11/19 - I remember thinking I would like this very much, I got No Second Prize somehow but never got this but always thought I would like it.  The mouse is a bit sensitive, but the racing is good.  You lean over way further in this than in no second prize.  Psygnosis weren't a racing publisher generally .. well until I realized just like 3 years later with wipeout where they became one of the biggest in the world :)  Ok now this was pretty good.  I liked the graphics very much and the racing was fun.  It was fun leaning over that much.  It was fun having so much braking control.  I might say I liked the controls 10% better than NSP in some ways, however big problem with collision.  NSP you only bump bikes if you really bump bikes.  You can thread the needle between two others sometimes really close and sometimes on corners and you dont hit them.  This one you can be well behind and off to the side and you still hit them and take damage.  Fortunately it gives them damage too probably more than you and you can blow up other bikes taking out your competitors that way.  This is a good game. I think the graphics are probably a bit better than NSP, but I prefer NSP.  Afterwards like in NSP you can watch a view from the helicopter of part of the race.  I think this is an excellent competitor to nsp and a good and worthy game.  
* Rick Dangerous 1990 COre Design - 11/11/2019 - hmm the title screen looks stupid.  At least you can select level. Oh this is a cheap environment platform game where everythign will kill you and there are traps on every platform and pixel collision kills you.  Its not fun in 2019.  
* Rick Dangerous 2 1990 Core Design. 11/11/2019 - Same problem as the first one - same year too.  I dont care for it.  
* Rainbow Islands - (11/15/19) Lukozers playthrough of this is hilarious.  The great Andrew Braybrook did the programming.  The mechanics of this were never crisp or discrete enough for me to really get it.  The jumping is stiff.  I kind of hate this.  I would have hated it a bit less before I watched Lukozer but I still would have hated it.  I dont begrudge anyone who loves it I just dont.
* Rampart - I think dust really liked this.  I liked very much the mechanics of it.  I thought it was really cool in the arcade.  I never even thoguht of playing it on Amiga. Only 2 players on Amiga  The graphics are crisp and I like them.  I dont like the control mechanics or I couldnt figure them out.  I would like more time and think it would be more fun with a little more time but of course thats part of the game.  
* revenge of the mutant camels 1991 - (11/15/19) I remember having a hard time finding this demo shareware version and when I did I was underwhelmed because I didnt know what to expect. I actually kind of recognized it but didnt realize until later it was because I had empire strikes back on atari.  Apparently there are restart points in this.  Update: Thats all in my memory but this game plays totally different to what I remember so I dont think I ever played this.  Maybe I played an original version or something like attack of the mutant camels?  Wow its 2 player co op.  This would have been so much fun to invest time into with a 2nd player.  The sprites are so funny and the ducking camel is awesome.  I got past the first level to 'raindrops keep falling on my head' or something.  I got to the level Manic Minter and then Whacky Whackers.  The backgrounds are so silly and funny.   Oh I just figured out if you hold the button you cana ttack in any direction to defend yourself.  I kept getting stuck floating near the top of the screen where the enemies come out.  This is a fantastic game and I wish I had this as a kid.  
* Road Blasters - (11/15/19) This could be a great game.  Its US Gold though so I dont have high hopes.  Ok its not bad at all.  The sense of speed is good, the first level isnt too hard (expecting that to be broken in a few levels) and the steering and shooting are pretty fun.  Ok I beat the third level and I can see some flaws, the draw distance is so low that its really difficult to get the gree orbs (fuel I guess) and similarly its nearly impsosible to avoid the mines.  
* revenge of the mutant camels 2 1988 - (11/15/19) wtf is thiss?  before jeff minters first version?  This is mastertronic.  hmm.  its got talk of beasties.  Its the same basic game, the graphics are not as fun and maybe a little more primitive and older if a bit more pro maybe.  I like the wave select.  Its so confusing.  Its not bad but a lot of the charm of the minter one is well its charm and this doesnt have any of that even if its not bad.  
* Railroad Tycoon (11/15/19) - 1990 Microprose.  Sid Meier. I played this for PC in 1997.  Ok you can save and load the game.  The graphics are super grainy but thats ok.  I dont know how to play this atm.  Its deep and I remember really liking it for the hours I played it in college but its not fun for me right now.
* Rocket Ranger (11/15/19) - I owned this and always wanted to like it so much but I could never figure out how to take off.  I remember not giving it enough time to really figure it out back then but really wishing I liked it more and wanting to like it.  I still cant figure it out.  An interesting thought I just had is what if this were the one game I got for Christmas that year?  what if it was just this for many months and thats all I had to play.  Would I have gotten pretty far?  Well lots of people I'm sure would say yes, but for me and the way my mind and motivations work I dont know and I kind of dont think so.  If I had made a map or kept track of everything and practiced it and played it over and over well maybe then.   Also if you spent $40-50 on it and then spent 15 minutes backing it up and loading the game you are more invested than if I just double click real quick like I'm doing.  
* Rambo 3 (11/15/19) Taito - Cool intro and exciting music.  Cool in game graphics crisp overhead sprites and cool music.  The gamplay is cute since if you walk up to the patrolling guards from the side you can easily stab and kill them but if you walk right in front of any of them they all start to attack you.  Well I dont love this right now but I can see that it wasnt too bad because I actually made some real progress (which is more than I can say for lots of Amiga games) so I like it ok.  its kind of fun making my way through the mazes.  Well damn I had half of my life but eventually touched an electrified door and died instantly :() when you die you start over.  This isnt bad at all.  I kind of like it and didnt expect to!
* RBI Baseball 2 (11/15/19) 1991 Domark or Tengen - Well the graphics and interface are prettty great.  Playing on the JIT amiga the gameplay is too fast to bat. Well even on the slower version its way too fast.  The graphics are pretty stunning in thsi though.  lets try it on my slowest amiga. The scrolling is a bit choppy but yeah on my slowest A1200 cycle exact it runs at a slower speed and is playable and fun.  The graphics really are great on this and I would have had a blast playign this bitd.  
* The Real Ghostbusters 1988 - or 1987 Data East - omg its a only slightly upgraded version of a C64 game I'm sure of it.  For a C64 game ok I would have played it for a few minutes but for an Amiga game geez no.  
* renegade 3 (11/15/19) thats the dumbest shit I've ever seen. Is this a serious release from teh people who made renegade 1 and 2?  Dinosaurs and BC cavemen and eggs flying at you with terrible moves and no control plus no music or sound??? Omg.  
* return of the Jedi (11/15/19) slightly silly upbeat version of teh death march.  Cool digitzed Speech! OK so its not entirely too hard.  I had like 5 lives and am on a speeder and it was fun bashing the other speeders to get to teh ewok village.  I like that part.  Now the graphics arent great, they are primitive probably ported from PC.  I dont understand the continue structure.  I then was in the falcon destroying a reactor (wiht exactly the same gameplay) and i did it and then was racing back but crashed, so then I stared at the beginning of the speeder bike section again??? weird.  I think it might actually be a game modelled after the Aztec Challenge?  however on the speeder section when I died I picked up right where I left off.  Weird.  
* Robocop 1989 Ocean (11/15/19) Intro screen is cool.  Really cool.  The gameplay is no good.  The graphics are ok but cartoony but also clear.  It doesnt make sense when youc an shoot and when you cant.  The punching was too close to not get damaged, and there were several set pieces which you coudln't avoid damage.  Its mind boggling that to jump you have to pushj down first then up.  
* Revenge of Defender (11/15/19) the title screen just says defender, but then revenge of defender.  Its got really hip late 80s music!  1988 Logotron ltd.  Wow I love this game!  Now I have a sneaking suspicion that its about to get way too hard, this has some of the coolest parallax and 3d effects Ive seen on the amiga.  The graphics are real blocky and unclear but also colorful and fast moving and the scrolling is incredible.  its not one hit death either which is a wonderful treat.  Hey I beat wave 02!  my life is nearly out though.  Well it doens't seem to have the rescue the humans mechanism and doesnt have the staying power it could for that and other reasons but its really cool.  
* Rogue Epyx 1986 (11/15/19) I dont know but I think this is actually pretty bad ass.  Its not as deep as nethack which in my case is a good thing.  I made it to level 2 after completely exploring level 1.  Thats a really cool game!  
* Robocop 2 1990 SpecialFX and Ocean.  Digitized title screen cool music.  Well its better than the first.  its just the enemies are so dumb and poorly placed that theres no way to progress without getting hit many times.  You get a decent amount of life so I survived for a while but then I was on a flying platform and i coudlnt get anywyere because they would always shoot my platform off.  It was cool to have the upgraded weapons though.  
* Robin Hood Legend Quest 1992 (11/15/19) - wow the graphics are clean and crisp and while not quite as much they remind me of Gods!  Its a side scroller and I'm afraid because before I touch the controls it looks like it could be a lot of fun, but ... ok 10 seconds in and the controls are good. T heyre fluid and the shooting is good too.  lets see if the combat works and if I can climb ladders well and stuff.  Yeah it works great!  its too hard for several reasons but I made some progress and its really cool.  The graphics are great and the highs core song is cool.  I got a high score 1990 and I like this a lot
* Robocop3 (11/15/19) - Uh oh its ays it is a 3d game?  oh interesting: F1 for the 'movie adventure' f2 for 'arcade action'.  Both included.  Lets see what they are.  F2 first. Ok you can select the scenario you want which is cool. 5 levels available.  Wow this is cool its a 3d shooter with shaded floors.  I've got it on my fastest amiga nd its running blazing fast and smooth.  You control the crosshairs like operation wolf or something but its all in 3d.  lets see what else you can do.  Oh this is great!  Right click to float forward, left click to shoot.  Cool creepy music.  this feels like a movie.  I would have loved this as a kid as long as it wasnt too terribly difficult coming up.  Ok I finally encountered ane nemy and the shooting was impossible. I was expecting to shoot at him with the crosshairs and hit but it didnt work like that and I got shot down.  I'm going to try it with a slower machine.  Ok scrolling is the slightest bit choppier but not a porblem.   Good news now I can see a bullet mark when I shoot.  Oh hot damn now the shooting is amazing!  its so precise and cool.  You can shoot guys over hostages shoulders with the precision crosshair.  I love this and they did a fantastic job.  So what if the walls or floors arent texture mapped. This is a great 3d game that went completely under the radar.  I'm impressed.  Oh yeah!  what about te movie mode?  Ok we have some screenshots and then the same news that I had in the other mode.  More text pages.  Whoa!  There are rendered backgrounds with 3d cars and characters.  Wow the driving is pretty cool.  its cool in the same way the shooting is cool. I have no idea what I would do when I catch the bad truck though it just shot me dead real quick.  I dont exactly know why its a movie because I was playing and died just like in an action game, but mabye its because o fthe pace of the action or the scenes of the action or soemthing?  this is a really cool and totally unexpectedly cool game.  
* resolution 101 11/15/19 - I totally wanted to own this and play it bitd because it said it was by the people who made thunderstrike and had a really cool smashtv style story.  OK there is a save and load here.  thats good news.  Oh its the running man not smash tv.  It says you ar a runner.  It has cool graphics and shooting and good controls kind of like robocop 3 actually but more colorful and fun natured and with cute rock music.
* Rise of the Robots 11/15/19 - has a cool fmv style intro.  bitd I couldn't really tell the difference between fmv and the lemmings intro and it didnt really matter to me.  Ok the fighting is clumsy as hell, frankly though the AI isnt as stupid cheap as the other games so I was able to win my first fight.  Thats a blessing but not enough to make this any good.  
* RuffNTumble 11/15/19 - this is a cool platform gun game with cutesy but really good beautifullyl drawn graphics.  It reminds me in some ways of the quality of levels as DKC and I thihnk I could have liked this and I dont have any complaints about it.  I dont know what the continue structure is but it didnt grab me in any way.  
* RType 11/15/19 - I always wanted to beat this as a kid, although I never played it on Amiga.  1987 Title screen is a big cheesy.  Developed by Factor 5 chris huelsbeck music!  the title music is excellent.  The music is good and the shooting is pretty good.  theres nothing wrong with this but its too hard.  I couldnt get anywhere and it takes you back to the beginning of the level when you die.  Graphics were pretty good but not too colorful (due to limitations)
* RType 2 (11/15/19) Weird I feel like this is the game I'm familiar with.  I wonder if there were some renamings or something.  Its pretty good but just brutally hard so its not so fun.  
* Rampage 11/15/19 1989 Activision - I coudln't get the controls to work.  The graphics are pretty good.  
* Race Drivin 1991 Tengen 11/15/19 Its got a really cool animated intro.  really really cool.  looks and sounds exactly like a cartoon.  Good smooth scrolling, cool backdrops.  Easy if floaty controls.  Its cool that its got replays.  The framerate is ok on my slowest A4000 but the controls are way way too sensitive.  The draw distance isnt far enough for me to know what is coming up.  
* Renegade Taito - 11/15/19 - the graphics here are grainy and cheesy.  The music is terrible and the combat sucks.  The enemies surround you too much and I cant figure out how to kick anyway.  
* Renegades 1991 - Interesting. Its like space invaders or galaga but with crisper cooler more high tech shaded graphics.  it doesnt have enough bullets which is a fatal flaw, but it lets you select what level to start on and there are two players (hot seat I dont know).  
* Risk 1989 Virgin - It seems like it works well being like the board game.  You can play comp vs comp if you want or up to 4 human players.  Thats pretty cool.  The scrolling works great around the map.  Its got keyboard shortcuts for most of the moves thats nice.  
* Red Baron - 11/15/19 - I played a Red Baron game in 2002 on PC taht was really fun for me.  I like all of the history in this game.  Thats pretty cool.  Thats a real accessible flight dogfight sim and it was fun.  The controls worked well too.  
* Road Rash 11/15/19 - I never wanted to like this but I should have played it back then because even back then I remember Jeremy from Computerwise liked this game and I judged it too harshly as being violent when actually it was probably one of the coolest and best racing games on teh saystem.  All other things being equal (like if all of the other racing games had a certain decent baseline level of quality) I would have liked other games more but things were not equal.  Ok well it doesnt move too fast but I think thats one of its strengths. The control is fantastic, and its got accurate rear view mirrors which is amazing.  oh damn I finished second but was close to first.  This is fun! 00200 001I0 011IC 1OJ0J  They shouldnt have 0 and O in the password.  
* Sensible Soccer 512K 11/24/19 - I loved this so much the second I got a demo for it, I loved the logo, I loved the gameplay, I loved everything about it.  I just remember feeling loyalty to Goal! for some reason, and to be fair I did think the big sprites looked better.  It plays great.  I suck for sure, and am losing 0-3 but its pretty fun. similar to kick off I don't know even how to dribble and barely know how to shoot or pass.  I lost 0-4.  Its great though.  Also you can watch the computer play against itself which is really cool and fun.  You know I feel kind of bad that I'm not better at these soccer games.  I was never good at GOAL! I never spent that much time with it except with Tom and he was better than me.  I never practiced, I never spent hours upon hours playing it and getting good and having fun.  I just sucked and did my best and fumbled and barely understood how to play and now I understand much less but some part of me feels guilty and unworthy because of it, its real weird.  I think if I want to I could get good at these now.  Several of the goals against me have been because there was a shot on my goal and it didnt make it in and I thought my keeper had it but he didnt and I was waiting for everyone to clear out so I could give it a good kick but my guy had it and the other team just kicked it from right in front of him into the goal.
* Sensible Soccer 1MB 11/24/19 - Music on the menu screen.  Way more cool SFX during the game including instruments.  Otherwise no noticeable differences.  
* Robosport Maxis 1991 11/24/19 - RBN Robot Broadcasting Network - Cool Speech intro.   This is pretty complicated.  One cool thing is you can print the map from inside the game.  It is a workbench intuition game and it brings up the default print dialog.  I think thats awesome.  This isn't too difficult to figure out, its got good hints and things and you end the turn and then can watch the turn play out as many times as you want and drag the window around with a hand icon or scroll with the scroll bars.  You can even sweep the scroll back and forth to see the action take place.  That technology is pretty great
* SDI Cinemaware 1987 11/24/19 - Its a global thermonuclear war game. You can look at satellites and see what they can see, you can protect the united states state by state.  It crashed when I lowered myself.  Its really a pity its not mouse controlled.  You can see the russians on the scanner.  The graphics are awesome like the board table when you die.  You go in your fighter to kill enemies and its a 3d space shooter for a few seconds.  pretty awesome for 1987.
* The Settlers 1993 11/24/19 - Its got amazing intro animation although its certainly glitchy for using my slowest A4000.  WHDLoad lets you skip the intro if you want.   Ok its not glitchy on my slowest A1200.  Wow the landscape graphics are awesome.  The map lets you zip to any spot you want.  So its like sim city but I got the impression it might actually be easier to get into believe it or not.  
* Saint Dragon 1990 11/24/19 - The graphics are actually really cool I love the animation of the ship and its dragon body.  The shooting is good the action is at a slow pace which I like, the enemies are animated and drawn well.  The background doesnt blow my mind but it looks good.  I dont know why I died the first time, it was pretty clear over there and I was watching pretty carefully.  when I died it didnt take me all the way back which was nice.  The sound is good with cool creepy music and fun explosion sounds, theres auto fire.  The powerups get really fun and powerful.  I like that you can sometimes shoot down the projectiles and I wish that were true more often in games.  I dont like that you can hit the ground and blow up, and I think I was wrong when I said it didn't take me all the way back . It took me pretty far back.  Well atleast it doesnt take all of your powerups away from you.  Its hard to tell how much it does take away, but you are still pretty powerful after you die even three times.   I got to the first boss but his attack pattern did something I didnt expect (it went all the way over ot the left side of the screena nd up and down) so I was supposed to go around it and it was hard for me to believe as it was coming near the bottom of the screen.  This is pretty good and I'm pretty sure I could beat the first boss.  4 continue credits is decently nice (not enough but more than most) I got top score 46400!  I did it!  Beat the first boss after just one continue!  326,400 points and 3 lives left.  This second level is pretty awesome actually 420,700 with 3 continues left.  this is a great game.  Now the second level has a few cheap things: 1. some missiles go way off screen and you have to remember that because they come back a few seconds later from taht side of the screen out of nowhere.  Wow this was on C64 and other 8bit machines?  Ok also there are some asteroids that come in from teh top or bottom and you ahve to know theyre coming because theres no defending against them.  
* 7 Cities of Gold 1985 11/24/19 - I dont have a good feeling about this.  Hmm it crashed so I cant play it but before it did it said it was possible to make new history or a new entire world?  Thats pretty cool actually.  
* Secret of Monkey Island - 12/7/2019 - Tim Schafer. I remember playing a demo of this and getting so into it and loving it so much even though I got absolutely nowhere, maybe solved one super simple puzzle or something.  It was so cool and immersive and beautiful.  There weren't many games that felt like a movie like this did.  I remember when you first take control being on this bridge and being so immersed in this beautiful world and wanting to explore everything in it.  Then in the bar there was so much cool stuff going on!  When I look at the solutions it kind of makes me mad how obtuse the puzzles in all of the games like this were and in the text adventures.  I could never figure this shit out, I would give up too early and frankly I don't want to.  I'm impressed by people who can though.  I love the idea of experiencing the story and art and experience of the game but not while trying to solve the absurd puzzles.  Maybe because of ADHD I can't keep the game overarching plot and quests in my mind as well as all of the various bits and bobs necessary to put the pieces together to solve the puzzles.  Maybe if I used a ton of pen and paper (big sheets)
* Sensible World of Soccer - 12/7/2019 - Its cool that there are lots of options here like season and career and you can start the career as player coach or just coach.  When you play as coach you can watch the match get determined with the computer playing itself.  Its also cool that they have teams from all over the world. 	I wonder if you can speed up the action?  its really cool.  This is good but I have to admit that I have no idea how to play these games anymore and at the moment with my current skills I stink.   
* Sensible Golf - 12/7/2019 - This would have been fun for some people, I honestly thought I would like this more, and its fine but I don't love it and didn't even get the ball in the hole before giving up.
* SillyPutty - 1992 System 3 - 12/7/2019 - This is probably exactly the same as the putty game above.  Lets find out.  Hmm I dont know if its exactly the same but this one is interesting and not terrible.  I always wanted to own this and I had a demo and the demo was great fun for me.  The graphics are fucking fantastic and I absolutely love the style and care that went into every pixel the sahding is amazing.  the controls are slow but they totally work.  There is a hint of platform collision edge detection problem but it wasnt a big deal.  The second level started me out by being hit which is cheap.  It was hard to figure out how to spit out the enemies I had absorbed but I figured it out and that woudl have been in the manual.  This isnt bad but I didnt lose a life yet and I dont really know why.  I got hit a lot.  I feel like maybe a cheat is on on accident or something.  Touch spikes and you die wow the high score screen is fucked with this emulator setting.  The continue structure is terrible (3 lives no continues) but overall its not bad and with some WHDLoad cheats I think this would be pretty fun for a while.
* Sleepwalker Comic Relief - 1993 Ocean 12/7/2019 - I dont like this but the graphics animation is good and cartoony, the premise is interesting and the scrolling and movement of the dog is grand.  
* Sleepwalker Comic Relief AGA- Ocean 12/7/2019 - Tehres a cool animated and narrated intro sequence.  I think the AGA graphics were slightly better but I didnt notice until I started looking and am not even sure that I saw anything.  
* Sleepwalker - 1993 Ocean 12/7/2019 - Graphics here were good especially copper effects.  I think the only difference between this and sleepwalker comic relief is the animated intro.
* Sleepwalker AGA - 1993 Ocean 12/7/2019 - Well this is the same.  
* Shanghai - 1986 Activision - 12/7/2019 - AKA Mahjongg on windows.  This is a game I wanted so bad because I thought the graphics were so cool, even if they were simple I love that style.  Lets see if I still admire it or not.  yeah it looks awesome.  Another reason I liked it is it was a game I could actually make progress on.  The most basic elements of the interface are funny in todays world.  click on one, click on the second tile tha tmatches, it doesnt test automatically but waits until you go to the top left and click remove.  haha :) no music.  I always wanted to own this bitd. 
* Skyfox - 1985/86 Electronic Arts.  Is this 3d?  It looks really cool and has pretty exciting music.   Press M for mouse.  Thats a great way to do it!  You dont have to get to any options menu or anything.  perfect.  Pretty impressive partial 3d effects.  Mostly its sprite scaling on a green plane but there was some stuff on screen in 3d.  Its nearly uncontrollable for me and I couldnt figure out how to go up or down but it was pretty cool to see especailly such an early attempt.  Oh!  Maybe I should have been using the joystick?
* Skyfox 2 - 1986/87 EA - are the intro credits really unskippable?  didn't I try the joystick button?  Well the 3d sprite scaling in space is a pretty effective technique even though the up and down is not clear but I didnt know what to do and gave up.  It could have been good.  
* Shadow Dancer 1989 1991 Sega US Gold - Its like shinobi and hard in the same way that you start the level over with one hit.  Thats lame.  however its pretty cool otherwise, although the genesis version is way better.  I might have liked this for a while if i had it as a kid but I wouldn't have gotten anywhere significant.  
* Side Arms - 1989 Probe - 12/7/2019 Lots of cool WHDLOad Cheats.  Cool intro with 1985 looking graphics.  They arennot great.  But the game is good and I can actually make progress!  I got to stage 2 with no cheats and there are lots of cool powerups, lots of lives, and you start right where you died.  This is relatively fair!  
* Sidewinder - 12/7/2019 - The intro graphics looked like HAM mode.    The graphics are ok, but uninspired imho but some of the shading on the metal is fantastic.  the palette is limited (probably due to screen modes) but it generally looks good and you can generally tell what is what.  One thing I really really like is with the slow moving projectiles you can plot out a path to move between them which I think is really cool and I wish more games did that.  
* Sidewinder 2 1989 - 12/7/2019 - wtf is this.  This is a completely different game with none of the appeal of the first, and with only a few passing similarities.  ugh. 
* Sinbad and the throne of the falcon 1987 Cinemaware - 12/7/2019 -  Wow theres a cool animated intro with some strange palette choices.  Wow the magnifying glass on the world is amazing!  that would have blown my mind back then.  Its one of those games that was using the new GUI technology to control the game (with menus and shit) and that can work, but it can also get confusing because then your options arent all obviously avaiable with buttons  you have to figure out what you can do.  Thats ok but I'm not interested.
* Skeleton Krew AGA 1995 Core -12/7/2019  Wow the graphics resolution is really high on that digital title screen text.  2 button Joypad support in the options!  The sprite rotation animation is wonderful even on the character select screen.  Well its a great attempt but confusing controls ruin it.  its begging for a 4 button stick and for better response to the enemies getting shot (you cant tell so the shooting isnt that fun).  
* Solomons Key 2 - 1992 Tecmo - 12/7/2019  This is a fangame based on the original NES game from 1992.  This was made in 2015.  wow it looks like gameboy graphics or NES or something.  The music is fantastic.  Well gosh this is pretty damn cool.  An NES game running on Amiga?  and it looks perfect and plays great. I'm really impressed.  
* Silkworm - 1977 Tecmo - 12/7/2019 YAY!  With the heli I beat the first level on my first try!  Thats an amazing achievementh imho.  YOu only get a few lives but you continue right where you left off.  The powerups are good.  This is the predecessor to swiv so you would expect they would be.  Its so good!  The explosion sounds are really great.  
* SimAnt HiRes - Oh wow that is high resolution.  The music is wierd AF I think its trying to be funky I think its sloppy.  I remember liking this so much at the Kechles house but at this point its a bit too complciated for my tastes, but this is a good version. it uses the amiga intuition windows and the resolution is great.  I'm impressed they got this many colors with this resolution. 
* SimAnt LowRes - 12/8/2019 - This version could perhaps technically be more colorful but I dont think it is the lower resolution means you cant see as much or get as many windows on screen.
* Silent Service - 12/8/2019 - Didnt I already play this?  No I dont think so.  Hey I sunk an enemy ship!!! I raised periscope and snuck up on an enemy ship.  I'm proud that I could figure it out!
* Silent Service 2 - 12/8/2019 - Wow loading really takes a while.  Its cool that you can pick so many options, like the date in the 40s or 'flawless torpedoes' vs 'historical torpedoes' which I'm sure exploded wrong or didnt explode at all sometimes.  This is a much more realistic sim which means I have to do shit like loading my weapons and figure out how to fire them so I'm not interested in all that.  The graphics and sounds are better than the previous and the interface is cooler, but it was more accessible before for me anyway.   
* Simon the Sorceror 1993 Adventuresoft - 12/8/2019 - Teh graphics are so clear and the intro is really well animated and cute.  I was able to make some level of progress like Monkey Island, but I dont know how much more obtuse this game is than that.  It had a lot of character and cute 4th wall breaking and stuff so I like it.  
* Simon the Sorceror AGA - 12/8/2019 - Some of the graphics are more colorful thats all.  
* Sim Earth LowRes - 12/9/2019 - Same Low Res/High Res thing as Sim Ant above.  Wow I feel drawn to this game. I always knew I loved Sim Ant but I only got to play Sim Earth for a few minutes at Caroline Streets house.  
* Sim Earth High Res - 12/9/2019 - WOW It uses the whole damn scree thats incredible Amiga Resolution.  The high res version is much better because of the user interface is so much clearer.  Ok a really cool thing about this game is all of the different game modes.  You can play experimental, easy,average, and hard but you can also do many different modes for each difficulty: Random planet, aquarium (where you build the continents), Stagnation (help civilization out of the stone age), earth (cambrian era), earth (modern), mars, venus, daisyworld (exploring the gaia hypothesis).  Theres so damn much gameplay in this game.  holy shit.  It explains what each mode is when youg et into it via a help window.  You can change the effect of many aspects of the atmosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, etc.  I really dont know what I'm doing but its so cool that there is so much in this game.  just before I quit I saw that there is an in game tutorial.  Thats awesome.
* Sim Life - 12/9/2019 - First impression based on title screen: omg these graphics are terrible.  The in game graphics aren't vastly better but this kind of game really doesnt need anything better.   Mostly by one guy: Ken Karakotosios.   There is an in game tutorial in this too.  This is cool you can create your own animals or try to establish a stable food chain.  There are lots of cool scenarios here too like: Desert to Forest, Feast & Famine, Carnivoria, Terrible Lizards, Mutants, etc I plopped down a bunch of tyrannosaurs.  It keeps saying OhLaLa (which I presume means they are mating?  The windowing interface is really good.  You can resize the window or even just drag to the rigth as you are dropping t-rexes down and it will auto scroll which is pretty impressive for the time.  I had fun just droping down tons of every kind of animal and seeing what happens.  I presume the enormous quantity of predators will eat all of the prey soon ...  Now even with all of the amigas great graphics I can barely tell what animals are what.  It doesnt matter all that much but its confusing and less interesting this way.  simpler less detailed and more cartoony sprites might have been better imho, but maybe not.  You know it looks like the t-rexes died out for the most part.  There are still a few here but I put down like dozens.  
* Sim Life AGA - 12/9/2019 - I'm hoping this one looks way better.  Lets find out.  Well the intro screen is no better.  The guis are no better.  It simulates so much about the world its awesome.   Ok yeah the graphics are slightly better.  Noticabley if you are looking like I did back to back, but they're not necessarily 'good'.  Still theyre workable.  This is a really cool game.  
* Smash TV - 12/9/2019 - The intro music is frantic and ok.  Ocean presents. Uh oh.  So it says you can play 2 players with 4 joysticks by using a parallel port adapter for the 2 extra joysticks.  thats pretty cool honestly.  Ok it looks good and plays good.  Its got a super shitty arcade feature where it kills you if you dont select which way you want to go pretty quickly but that is an arcade thing so that can be foregiven.  the collision detection is fair so you aren't dying too easily by just nearly bumping the baddies, and the shooting is fun and the explosions are good.  the sprites are all good and have a consistent nice shiny look to them (although the arcade looked quite a bit better in its own way).   I'm trying to get the dual joystick working.  Got it.  It wasnt hard but winUAE autoreselected the mouse so I just have to not use it when I've selected the window.  the collision detection on the treasure pickups isnt so good because its too tight and you can walk right over lots of treasure and not pick it up because you didnt walk over the center of it which makes it impossible to get some of them because you cant afford to go over and over areas in this game back and forth.  The really nice screen transitions through the hallway with the awesome catchy music that is in the NES game doesnt exist here unfortunately.  it just blinks you to the next screen.  that was honestly a big part of the immersion of that version of the game though it doesnt seem like it would matter that much it made it constatnly evdient that you were in a persistent world maze of deadly connected rooms.  This just indicates that.  This is good with the dual controllers.  The continue structure is a piece of shit. This is a quarter sucking arcade game by definition and was not intended to have players get so good at it they could beat it on one quarter, but you get 1 fucking continue in the game.  That is absolutely absurd.  There are some WHDLoad Cheats which might make this fair again - theres like a skip level cheat at least.  
* Ski or Die - 12/9/2019 - Rocking EA intro.  Holy shit its Rodney Dangerfield!!!  Its the worst pointer ever in a game haha.   Wow theres a pretty fun Operation Wolf style snowball fight game in here which is better than OW!  I cleared the level too by hitting all of the kids with a snowball.  thats pretty darn fun!  Esc lets you quit that event.  The downhill skiing is no fun imho.  The snowboard halfpipe is ok.  This is ok and clearly an answer to winter or california games.  but this doesnt have two players I dont think which boggles the mind since thats the only fun to really be had from event games like this.  Oh well.  
* Shaq-Fu - 12/9/2019 - Ocean - Delphine.  This is so silly.  I never thought this would be even decent on any platform.  Its story is supernatural.  It doesnt even look like shaq in the cutscenes.  Its cool that its got an overworld.  I won one match.  The graphics in game look a bit like another world.  I wonder if it was similar tech?  
* Shaq-Fu AGA - 12/9/2019 - The title screens look better.  I do like that you go to the different fights on the overworld.  The in game graphics are only slightly more colorful, not better per se.  
* Soccer Kid - 12/9/2019 - I always thought this might be some fun, but then I saw Nick Jenkin play it online and I dont know I liked it but also didnt.  Matt Furniss was involved here.  Oh I've got him listed 2 other times in this very document haha.  Although I think the character sprite is high quality I don't personally like the specific character style of the cartoon. Its really cool that theres a tutorial in the options menu.  I like the non-aga graphics even if they are a bit washed out colorwise.  The dithering is good and it looks great.  Hmm theres something wrong here.  Its playign super super slow.  
* Soccer Kid AGA - 12/9/2019 - Its got a cool animated space pirate intro.  These graphics are significiantly better.  The music is excellent.  Reminds me a lot of Pinball Fantasties imho.  The graphcis in game on the AGA version here are much better and really this is how I suspect it was intended to look.  I actually wonder if they started with this look and then downgraded to the lower end computers.   I think I could have had some fun with this but in some ways its so limited like Chuck Rock was.  Its not like mario just because its a platformer.  Its not like mario at all.  Yeah you can jump some and land on platforms but geez mario lets you do all sorts of things that are clear (at least after having a lot of experience with it) and this doesnt have clarity imho.  The level designs hold it back and make it kind of boring but the controls are confusing.  Maybe I need to do the tutorial.  
* Skidmarks - 12/9/2019 - I always loved the look of this game so fucking much.  I wanted Blitz Basic just because It hought if I had it I could make this game.  Il iked a lot about this game.  It looks liek the cars are rendered because the animation is so damn smooth.  Some of the cool things about this game were the slope of the tracks even if the dithering is quite heavy it looks fantastic, and damn those awesome skidmarks are cool.  I had hardly if ever seen marks from the car left on the track and persistently too.  thats just a really bad ass feature.  The billboard scrolling by the cars when you win or lose is really cool too.  I lost my first race 3rd place lets try a few more times.  its very fun.  Yay!  My second time on that track and I got first place!  The continue structure of this game and the overall win condition isnt clear but this is a fundamentally great game.  
* Skidmarks AGA - 12/9/2019 - I see almost 0 difference between regular and AGA which is fine.  This is a great game.
* Shadow Of The Beast - 12/9/2019 - 1989 Psygnosis.  This was really amazing when I first saw it but I never got to actually play it back then.  I played it some earlier this year after watching part of a walkthrough and I got pretty far (for me anyway).  I like the music and the whole aesthetic is fucking fantastic.  The graphics still look fantastic.  So clear and crisp and interesting.  with so much parallax,  It looks so immesrive and 3d compared to anything else at teh time. or for many years later.  I like how it tries to integrate the story via text.  I would have gotten absolutely nowhere without a walkthrough bitd, the advantage of this being so popular I might have been able to find one somewhere in a mag or from a user group or something.   The gameplay while not absolutely terrible is lacking in many ways and a bit more polish and this would have actually stood the test of time and would have been an unmissable game.  why can you not see the enemies until instants before they enter the screen?  why do you just have to punch them?  They are moving so fast you have to know they were coming and are there.  Why do I have to look out for a bear trap in the ground that is a total of 6 pixels 1-2pixels above the ground.  I really like the main character, even though I find it kind of gross that he has exposed flesh on his head.
* Shadow of the beast 2.  1992 - 12/9/2019 - really cool animated intro.  beautiful.  Eerie. Atmospheric.  Ok the graphics are great, the parallax isnt as deep (disappointing) the character sprite isnt as interesting, but the attack is way way better.  but no the enemies are way way worse.  They shoot little undodgeable balls.  This game would have pissed me off so much back then, especially if I had spent a lot of time with the first one and wanted more of the same. 
* Shadow of the Beast 3 - 1992 - 12/9/2019 - This WHDLoad has joypad controls.   wow its sort of modern intro with airplane engines.  beautiful graphics (of course).   Ok one cool thing about teh continue structure it lets you pick the level you want out of 4 from the start.  That means if you can get good enough to beat one of the levels (which is probably not easy at all) you can get to the next one every time after.  Thats nice.  The music is nice.  The main character sprite is only slightly more interesting than in 2.  The attack is better in this one than either of the other two.  The barrel rolling is amazing animation! it loosk so good.  The life bar is more forgiving than in the others.  The background copper effect is great.  Oh and wow if you stand there for a while it gives you fucking hints?  Holy shit.  You get three lives.  This one is pretty cool actually.  not the greatest game ever but I like this one.  The gameplay feels decidedly early to mid 80s but the graphics sure dont.  This is good.  
* SimCity12 v1.0 - 12/13/19 - 1989 Maxis - I loved this game so much.  The GUI was great and the buttons were so clear and colorful.   The scrolling is super responsive.  Theres something I love about the more grid based nature of this original version of the game where everything fits together so discretely.  There are a lot of things to like about games like cities skylines but things arent on a strict grid there and I like that about his game in a quaint way.  The interface was pretty advanced for back then.  mouse to edge of screen scrolls that way.  hold b to bulldoze.  this is a fantastic game.  Update: This one wont save to HD either.  
* SimCity 512k - 12/15/19 - Well this is a great game and it plays great and I dont see much diff between this and the other version, however (and I dont know if this applies to the other version) saving your city doesnt work.  Thats a major problem with this WHDLoad but probably I could save to a data disk?  Well not easily anyway I just tried and it doesnt recognize it even if its in UAE when the game is launched.  Maybe it has to be added to the WHDLoad slave or something?  I added something to tooltypes but it didnt fix it.  So I dont know how to save atm.  Still this is a fantastic game.  
* Slam Tilt Pinball AGA - 12/15/19 - The WHDLoad says it uses the CD32 controller!  I bought this full price for my A1200 bitd (a bit after it was released I guess bu t it was the full boxed version for sure.  I wonder where I got it from?  It was one of the only things I did on the A1200 since the internal hard drive was fucked.  I dont remember this intro music.  This game was amazing and the only thing that could beat pinball fantasies at all.
* Slam Tilt AGA 2MB - 12/15/19 - Well I wonder if this will save my high scores?  The WHDLoad implies that it will so I am probably safe believing it.  I will admit this doesnt have quite as much character as pinball fantasies does.  It does have more polish however.   the Pirate table has boobies with nips.  There is no center bumper between the flippers.  The pirate table has a lot of character honestly.  This is a great game.   I can't tell the difference between this and the other version at all.  
* Shufflepuck Cafe 1989 Broderbund - 12/15/19 - This was a game I always believed was only on the mac and I played this bitd (Probaby at Nick Wooleys house) and was jealous of my mac owning friends.  In fact I think I played this on a powerbook that he brought to school one day.  It was so cool to see that amazing laptop technology back then.  Geez some of these opponents are brutally hard (like crazy hard) like the woman in the cape?  Its a really cool 3d use of the mouse to great effect.  Its a good game with a stupid difficulty curve.  I couldnt make a single point against that woman even though I did share a decent volley.  the glasses kid I can score easily upon.  
* Shuttle 1991 - The Space Flight Simulator - I really wanted this bitd but never played it at all.  I thought I did but that was the Halley project I think or something else space shuttle related from 1987 or so on C64.  Thunder Mountain I believe.  Whoa cool its g hen you pick a launch location you watch a cool 3d zoom in cut scene.  Wow this is really really cool in some ways.  Like its got an enormous scrollable GUI for each control panel front center left right overhead aft left aft right aft and all have different switches and gauges.  Thats freaking amazing.  It telsl you what to do on a teleprinter 'enterprise, turn on both heads up displays, over'.  Lets see if I can do it.   Also keyboard combinations for every panel.   I did it! It gave me further instructions on the teleprinter (although they just said to do what you want) Its even got ways to zoom right to the panels with the functions you want.  The gui in this game is actually incredible and way ahead of its time.  
* Shinobi 1989 Sega - 12/15/19 - The WHDLoad has a level skipper built in.  One hit kills.  The graphics are pretty shit because of all of the dithering so nothing is clear colors.  The animations are shit.  It attacks you from the moment you start playing (which it should let you progress a bit before you get attacked) but its still an ok game with loads of history and important for its time and what it was and is.
* Space Quest 4 - 12/15/19 - Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers - Fortunately you can skip the intro.  Well the graphics look like they suck.  Yup they sure do.  This (like the other sierra games) is a graphically dirty port from PC to Amiga so it doesnt use the Amigas capabilities much.  With that said, It really doesnt detract from the games so if you like this kind of game well maybe its ok.  I remember being really confused (not knowing that this was a tongue in cheek game) when it said I was in Space Quest XII - Vohauls Revenge II.  Now I think thats hilarious that it starts you off there!  I remember getting into a sewer and dying over and over.  I also remember loving exploring around all of the possibilities in this town.  I remember getting to a spaceship and requiring a password from the manual which I didnt have since I got the game from Scott Crook on (as I remember) 14 floppy disks.  That was a really nice thing for him to do.  I played it at dads office on the secreteries 486 PC.   Wow on my single speed A1200 emulation loading each new screen is dirt slow.  Theres an energizer bunny who joins us if I take too long!  
* Super Off Road - Ivan Ironman Stewarts - 1989 Graftgold? 12/16/19 - I owned this and played it a lot on NES bitd.  Plays great and looks great.  Better than NES.  I dont know if its better than genesis or snes (was it on those?) but its good and would have been just as much fun as the NES game if I had it back in the day.  It performed well too.  Three players somehow (it seemed like maybe a second joystick and then the keyboard).  I got 2nd place.  The music was good and fun but probably was cuter on the NES.
* Spot - 12/16/19 - I remember liking this game on NES and remember liking it a lot because I could actually make progress (or it seemed like I could).  Wow its got a board editor.  Thats cool!  I forgot the rules and just lost quick.  :)  
* Spy vs Spy 12/16/19 - 1989 - I remember someone like Aaron suggesting this game on NES and remember playing it but not really liking it because I coudlnt figure it out, but I like the idea.   This is ok, it doesnt look any better than the NES game at all.  I dont know but Im not sure its even higher resolution!?!  The music is nice if simple.  I dont know what to do at all now either.   
* Spellbound Dizzy - 12/16/19 - I was always interested in these games because they were so popular in the magazines.  Lets see if this one is any good.  No not to me it isnt but I like the idea that they are simple platformers that have simple puzzles and are easy to make progress on.  For that reason I might have actually liked them bitd, at this point though I dont have a good impression and dont like them. 
* Spindizzy worlds - 12/16/19 - I thought this was a dizzy game.  Wow the 3d effect here is awesome! Oh so its marble madness!  But this one has zero tolerance for errror I coudlnt even beat the first 20 second level.  damn!  Its pretty cool though but it would have made me very mad and should have been more forgiving. 
* Super Monaco GP - US Gold 12/16/19 - Crashed
* Street Sports Basketball - EPYX 1988 - 12/16/19 I always thought these games would be so cool to buy and play.  I always wanted them on C64 and Amiga.  Part of the epyx style is havign cool level select screens.  this one has a bunch of people you can play against.  Well its pretty cute.  I'm in the suburbs and theres a hose in the way of the court because we are playing between two garages on a driveway The animation is a bit choppy but it works and the players move slow. easy is actually easy and the opponents arent too cheap so its pretty fun if basic and real cute.  I probably would have liked it as a kid.  
* Stryx - 1989 Psygnosis - 12/16/19 I remember  wanting to play this game but I don't know what its like.  The intro with the awesome car flying down the chamber is really cool.  It actually outlines how the data is setup on the disk with this much code and this much music.  It says it will give you a fully animated win sequence.  Its like a 1000k intro sequence!  I really love it so far.  I suspect its going to have a terrible continue structure, but if it doesn't this might have been one I really really liked.  I love this intro.   They say they went to a lot of trouble to give quality and value for money.  ok Interesting.  The graphics are really colorful and clear with great pixelated computer look to them.  Ok its a platformer probably shooting is involved but I didnt have a gun.  Its one life no continues but you can take a lot of hits and fall from a long way up and not die.  I believe them that they put a lot of care into this game.  I feel like the title didnt do it any favors.  if you stand there too long enemies materialize from out of nowhere and shoot you.  OK even if you can take a lot of hits, the enemies (even the first ones) are cheap and shoot y ou again the instant you stand up.  I dont know how to get a gun and shoot back and I dont know what I'm supposed to do but you know what?  I think theres a lot of promise in this game.  
* Steel Empire - 12/16/19 - I was always curious about this game.  It looks like a shooter with cool player ships and weapons, but I cant seem to skip the intro.  Maybe because I'm in my turbo emulator.  yes I slowed the emulator and a click moved on.  I'm going to do battel practice although there is a complete campiaign too.  Hmm its some kind of overhead battle against one enemy where you pick a bunch of mechs based on how much money you have and you control them one by one to try to take out your enemy.  You can apparently cycle through your different mechs.  I couldn't figure out the controls but it was pretty neat.  
* Stratego 1991 Accolade - 12/16/19 - This is one of those I was always curious about.  Its based on a board game by Milton Bradley which I have never played either.  The intro screen is interesting.  It looks like they digitized a photo and put some simple black pixels in to make it look clearer maybe its from teh box of the game?  Its got built in templates for defense setups.  Ok its like a simpler chess with more pieces.  I like it!  I wonder if I had bought this if I would have played it?  I think I would have some.  Probably with dad.  Probably I would have figured out all of the rules and I would have wanted the board game too.  
* Star Wars - 1983 1987 Lucasfilm and Tengen.  12/16/19 Its got a decent intro soundtrack.  Its the song and its a trumpet-ish sound and a bass.  It could be so much damn better.  its not looped quite right and the bass is funky.  The scrolling text doesnt extend into the horizon.  I'm being picky though.  Lets see if it plays well.  ok its not half bad.  I made it to the port at the end of the pit the graphics are good and the shooting is good its mouse based.  Its not bad at all actually.  I feel like if I knew how to launch the missile at the end of the row I could beat that part in 10 or 15 minutes.  This was all on the easy mode.  This is obviously based on the early 80s star wars arcade game vector graphics arcade game.  You can take 9 hits.  WOW I did it!  I destroyed the death star!  I'm so proud!!! It took me maybe 5 tries and a cool thing is if you miss the port at the end you can try again as long as you haven't taken too many hits. this is a good game and you know what else?  Its got samples of voices from teh movie.  "Great shot kid that was one in a million!" (or something).  I think I woudl have liked this if I had bought it bitd.  
* Switchblade 1989 Core Gremlin - 12/16/19 - Ben Daglish on music!  Rest in Peace Ben Daglish.    Whoa the graphics suck compared to what I was expecting.  Theyre cartoony and small and 8bit looking (though more colorful).  Interesting control scheme where the power of your attack depends on holding the button.  Awesome classy music.  Music is way classier than the graphics and gameplay atm.  I can't pick up this vial.  Its got this fatal flaw where the enemy hits you and then you are knocked back and paralyzed and then since they are still walking toward you they hit you again. Theres no recovery time.  Unfortunately that even happens if you accidentally dont hold the button down long enough because then you will kick over their heads and then they hit you several times until their programming tells them to turn around.   Its actually pretty cool in other ways though like the map seems pretty intricate.  there are ladders and pits (that dont kill you) and enemies and the attack is ok if you can plan ahead enough.  you have to know the enemies are going to be there because its screen based so many times you walk to the next screen (or fall down to the next one) theres an enemy there waiting for you somewhere who will hit you if you dont know to attack immediate.  I like that I got to a dead end and I had learned earlier that I could occasionally destroy blocks so I tried that here and it worked!  Hot damn its fun figuring out secrets like that.  The jumping is super clumsy.  I wonder if this is a metroidvania?  If so unless I find a continue spot its pretty unforgiving.  It seems like a cheat is on because everytime I die it seems to recharge.  Maybe I've been getting potions or something that do that.  This is a cool game actually.  Ok I got a sword but dont know how to swing it.  .   And the music is getting a bit repetitive now.   Escape just quits wihtout asking.  unfair.   This is a cool game.  I got a high score! 15010 score #1!  I think if I can figure out how to shoot weapons this is a really cool game along the lines of castlevania or maybe metroid.  
* Switchblade 2 Gremlin - 12/16/19 - The graphics have a ninja gaiden perspective.  However I cant figure out how to get over the second set of boxes in the beginning 10s of the game.   Ok a video showed that a quick squat then you can super jump.  The combat in this is pretty cool and nothing like the previous game.  This one the controls are much more fluid.  I remember hearing about this game and wanting it bitd.  The enemy graphics are awesome actually.  They are animated really cool too and are cool enemies.  YOu get 3 lives in this one and I died pretty quick.  ok in this game the walls that are destructible look slightly different.  This is a good game.  
* Speedball 1988 Bitmap Bros - 12/16/19 - wow its SO GOOD!  I dont know if I've ever played this one but I know I've played the second one.  I got decent at it and was playing a knockout game and scored lots of points!  I'm proud of myself.  Thats totally fun.  Theres a league and some way to save your league to disk (but I don't know if it works in the WHDLoad version)
* Space Quest 1986 - 12/16/19 - Space Quest CHapter I the Sarien Encounter.  Wait didnt I just play this a few weeks ago??? Well I guess not.  The graphics here are terrible though.  ugh.  Its slow and theres no way to speed it up.  
* Space Quest II 1988 - 12/16/19 - Vohauls Revenge (Reference in SQ4).  ITs cool that its got a pretty cool space station.  The sound is decidedly pc speaker level.  The graphics are decidedly ega and the colors didnt change.  Its cute that when you release your grip on the space broom it floats away.  I'm ok with having to type commands like look at watch.  It works just fine even if its not entirely graphical.  Thats a fine compromise.  PgDn which is the help key gives you a whole help menu.  Thats really nice.  
* Space Quest I Enhanced - 12/16/19 - graphics are instantly better.  Way more colorful colors.  Similar music but I guess its more orchestral now.  Wow graphics are way better.  I could swear I just played this a few weeks ago.  Maybe I watched a video of someone playing it???  maybe it was late so I was delirious and thought it was me playing?   hmm ... yes I absolutely remember all of this.  
* Space Quest III The pirates of Pestulon - 12/16/19 - I vividly remember this full page ad in the magazines and I really wanted to play it.  From just the ad it seemed like the kind of thing I would love.  I wonder if I had actually bought that specific game if I would have been invested enough to spend some time with it and get used to some of the tropes and puzzles and maybe eventually would have liked this style?  The music is better.  Whoa theres a transformers head on the 4th screen!  The graphics are ok with lots of dithering and typical EGA colors.  you can just walk off the side of a ledge and die.  
* Super Putty CD32 - 12/16/19 - 1992 System 3 - lots of WHDLoad cheats for this one.  theres no difference between this and the amiga one.  I dont even think I can use the other buttons certainly cant to jump.
* Supercars 1990 Gremlin 1 disk version - 12/16/19 - This was the predecessor to Lotus in some respects.  By the same team at least.  This was a hit and I always wanted to own this based just on reviews and screenshots.  Hey its really fun!  I got first place 1 in 5 laps.  I'm proud!  This is a great fun game.  There are 9 tracks and it looks like you can play them in any order and it keeps track of which tracks youve beat.  I just beat tracks 1 and 3 easily.  Well I was in first place but I see you have to do it without wrecking y our car!  I skidded once too often and my tyres exploded :)  Great game!  The sound isnt that great and the scrolling is just slightly choppy but the graphics are clear and I like that very much and I like that there are different levels to the driving.  
* Supercars 1990 Gremlin 2 disk version - 12/16/19 - This one has a cool news desk intro.  Several times while I played this I lapped the last place racer.  This is a great game! 
* Summer Games & Summer Games 2 - 12/16/19 - They're lighting the olympic flame and setting doves free.  Thats nice.  Oh damn there are like 15 events!  I guess the sequel just added events.  OHHH I played 'the games summer edition' in September and this is just an expansion on that one.  Well also it doesnt load the kayaking unfortunately.  ugh I hate the kayaking. This like the others would be a fun set of mini games for multiple people.  
* Super Skidmarks 2 CD32 - 12/16/19 its super cute that theres a 3d rendered acid software sprite rotating as a ball in a built in pong game on the title screen.  Classy fun touch there.  Well maybe because I just played supercars, or maybe because i'm better or maybe because this is a better game I just kicked ass and got 1st place without much trouble.  Its harder to take a large lead in this game than supercars, but I just love the 3d effects in this game and how they affect the racing.  I love half pipes liek that for some reason.  I love how the tracks are left on the ground (skidmarks) how the cars animate, THis is just great.  
* Space Ace 2 - 12/16/19 - I always wanted to play and beat and master all of these games.  Theres a lot of dithering but thats ok.  Theres some broken audio.  I always wanted to buy these for the Amiga because the screenshots looked so arcade authentic.  Well I think they are however the load times probably would have pissed me right off.  Still I probably would have kept playign these a lot.  I feel like I should have bought dragons lair and this even if I didnt know much about them. With that said having just 3 lives is fucking absurd even insulting.  Thats not an arcade conversion.  I think that really woudl have pissed me off now that I think about it.  Perhaps theres a code though and maybe I would have stumbled upon it???  No one in the arcade plays this game with just 3 continues to figure it out and then starts over.  that actually makes me mad even today.  Bigger problem: The animation is choppy which means you can't see whats happening until the game has decided it was too late for you to respond.  Going to my faster amiga to see if that helps (but it shouldnt matter - this is nigh unplayable).  Ok well at least it says you can save your position by pressing the s key during a scene and then if you successfully complete the scene you will be promptedfor the save disk.  Press l and you will be prompted for your disk to load from.  
* Space Ace - 12/16/19 - Well at least I was able to make 2 successful actions before dying in this one.  3 lives is absolutey absurd and insulting.  I kind of cant believe this.  I had just added these games to my list of games I regret buying back then because a part of me wanted so much to experience their fantasy and be part of the game, however, with stupid 3 lives its just absurd to imagine that this is a workable continue structure and it would have made me feel so ripped off.  
* Star Trek 25th anniversary AGA 12/16/19 - Wow the intro music sounds great!  I feel like I played this a bit bitd maybe I rented it for SNES?  I know I didnt get far, but I also know I felt real immersed and enjoyed the little progress I made.  Wow the graphics are really great.  Its exciting and beautiful although I really dont know what to do.  
* Scrabble 1989 US Gold - 12/16/19 I dont really know why I put this in my list to play.  I dont remember wanting to play this back then and Words with Friends is way better now.  Its just what you would expect.
* Savage 1989 Probe/Firebird Software 12/16/19 - Cool 3d Hacktro.  You can load Intro/Game1 or Game2/3 and I dont really know what that means.  Oh cool it looks like it will let you start from thoseplaces.  Cool animated intro (if a bit MS Paint ish.  Witha  cool voice saying SAVAGE!  Funny graphics on title screen.  It says ORgy of Violence on the title screen :)  I dont know how to start the game so I guess I'll restart and go back to the menu.  Well its not great.  The graphics arent bad, but I saw Nick play this on the Spectrum and wow it was amazing on that for what that computer could do.  For the Amiga this isn't special or fun.  I died after a few minutes at least I got that far into it.  
* Scooby-Doo & Scrappy-Doo - 1991 - 12/16/19 - Music is ok.  Platforming is just ok.  Collision is ok.  Parallax through the windows is cool.  enemies are stupid.  Dont know what the point is or anything so its not fun.  Died pretty quick.  
* Satan - 1990 Dinamic - 12/16/19 - Wow this looks cool.  I'm a warrior but you can choose a wizard too.  Sprites are awesome.  Scrolling is ok.  controls are ok if a bit stiff.  Its cool.  You continue from the last ledge you were on, you can get knife powerups to shoot in spread.  You can apparently get a beam weapon too.  I beat the first screen!  I like how you can climb on shit.  I dont know about this game.  I think it was fucking amazing for 1990, but I'm not too drawn to it even though I think I could actually make some decent progress. 
* Sherman-M4 - 1989 - 12/16/19 - Cool 3d graphics!   Oh cool built into the game is realism so you can have unlimited ammo and fuel.  Well I could move around without much trouble.  I like this one ok.  
* Spy vs Spy 2 the island caper 12/16/19 - This is kind of dumb.  Its cuter graphics than the other one, but I have no idea whats going on.  
* Super Space Invaders 1991 Taito - Graphics are better, theres no shields, there are multiple levels, its pretty cool and would have been ok at the time, but not fun for me atm and I got nowhere.  
* Spy vs Spy 3 - Arctice Antics - 12/16/19 - wtf.  I dont have anything against these games I just dont get them at all and they are not appealing to me.  
* Super C - Konami 1990 - 12/16/19 - I bet this is no good but it could be ok.  Cool konami logo.  Crap animation on title screen.    What?  Saved games in Contra??? Thats cool!  well this would have pissed me off so bad if I had bought it thinking it was like the NES game.  THe colors are garish and the sprites are big but that makes the hitboxes too big for the size of the screen and for the height of the enemies and their shot lines.  Its not fair or fun.  THe sprites keep flickering too which is not something you saw much on Amiga and some of the sprites were incomplete like the dead player has no torso!?!  
* Stack up - 12/16/19 - ugh its like dr mario but because the pieces are animating you can't tell whats what and its hard to look at.
* Super Street Fighter II ECS - The New Challengers 1995 US Gold - 12/16/19 - Well the intro looks fantastic at least (though not as good as SNES). No sound in the intro or title screen?    There are a thousand intro screens to make ti dramatic.  Ok level select is ... ok.  Well it plays pretty good actually.  The backgrounds are interesting but with strange colors they look unrealistic though still recognizable.  The sprites are tiny and not clear.  They are nothing like the arcade although they look ok for what they aren.  None of them are drawn poorly they just arent anything like the arcade. only a bare resembleance.  I beat cammy with fei long!  It wasnt hard.  I think I was on 3 stars difficulty too.  Most of the sound effects are missing.  theres just swing and hit noises.  THeres a fuzzy not dark shadow under each character that probably shouldnt even be there.  So itsa really not bad playability.  APparently you can use two button. I beat ken too.  Big no-no escape instantly takes you to the main menu losing all progress. Instant.  Thats shit.  Kens music sounds pretty good but not rich like the arcade and like I know the Amiga is capable.  this is interesting.  Its kind of the best fighting game on the amiga!?!   The two button gives you kicks and punches and although you really can't pull off the same moveset that you can when you have access to all strengths you can do a lot of damage that way and its pretty fun.  I shot a sonic boom without much trouble but a flash kick wasnt working.   I wonder if you use the keyboard if you get six keys for buttons?  Yup you sure do!  I think its JKL for Kick and UIO for punch.  It works pretty good and its real easy to do a hadoken this way.  so ultimately .. I like it!  
* Super Methane Bros CD32 - 12/16/19 - whoa theres a really long animated intro.  Ok so this is a new bubble bobble game for two players with no catchy music but with great shiny early 90s graphics (the kind that I love).  I dont love bubble bobble so I dont love this but it is definitely good and has enough twists on bubble bobble to keep it interesting so your bubble bobble skills dont immediately transfer.  Probably a great fun 2p game.  One thing I loved about it?  Unlimited continues.  Every game should have that.  
* Super Street Figher 2 Turbo AGA - 12/16/19 - Well the char select screen looks great.  The colors are good.  The options are sparse which should be ok.  Theres cool speech in the select.  The backgrounds look good if washed out and are totally unanimated.  lets see how it plays.  I can't figure out the buttons it was tricky because even for the joystick I had to hit a key to select my character!?!  I have pressed every key and legit cant figure out how to kick.  the punches are for some reason QAZSE!?!  thats for p1.  There are no kicks.  also the game is slow to animate and its ... well ... no good.  You know what ... there wasnt music!?!  
* Super Street Fighter 2 DX AGA - 12/16/19 - OK this is probably the AGA version of the ECS one above.  Character select is fine.  Ugh the sprites are small but beautiful for what they are if a bit grainy.  the Guile theme is great!  no complaints about the music.  Oh wow this one you can use the CD32 pad!  Will it work well???  It doesnt work until you go into WINUAE and set it to be a CD32 pad.  That actually might be a source of some problems in lots of the other CD32 games that I have played that didnt have good controls.  yeah it works!  Sound effects like death are in there.  This one is actually pretty damn good.  
* Second Samurai - 12/16/19 - ECS Version.  Psychnosis.  I didnt realize it was them.  That makes me all excited.  I have a feeling I'm going to love this.  Ok i got past one big dragon boss and then died on the second boss. I didnt love this game but it was pretty cool.  
* Second Samurai AGA - 12/16/19 - its really cool that its 2psimultaneous.  This would have probably been tons of fun for some people bitd.  The graphics dont look much different there arent more options.  Maybe the boss sprites look way better?
* Stun Runner - 12/17/19 - Whoa this is cool.  Its a 3d polygon based racing game with no opponents on interesting tracks that even go in halfpipes.  This second level has boost pads and opponents or at least obstacles. but you can shoot those obstacles.  You can even go upside down.  I got through the first two tracks and am proud of myself.  This is a cool game.  THe frame rate is a bit low on my slower amiga. 
* Syndicate - 12/17/19 - I remember reading about this when it came out and it soundedkind of cool and sinceit was from Populous team I thought I might like it but apparently its not like populous.  Theres a movie level animation intro which was really cool sci fi background.  It is really cool!  I completed the first assassination mission and am proud.  I might have liked this game as a kid especially since it looks like you can save.  YES It saves on the HD.  Awesome.  
* Space Harrier 2 - 12/17/19 - Well only a few lives, you can select any stage (thats fantastic!) the collision isnt as good as the first imho.  The cotnrols are good.  Theres no sound fx though no shots or explosions.  ok apparently you can switch music or fx.    THe music is good but not as good as the first and not tracked all that well.  Its not punchy or exciting enough.   I think its cool that its in Fantasy Land which I think is the same land that OpaOpa is in in umm ... That shooter ... Fantasyzone?  Well I got to the boss of level 1 but there werent enough lives I think I'm ok with this actually.  I think this continue structure is ok: A few lives per level with level select.  Thats an ok continue structure.  You can even make it so level select is greyed out until you beat the previous (unlocking).   After playign the first one I think the shots are too invisible and come at you too quickly.  they move too fast to avoid compared to the first.  I'm sure I could get used to where most will go but also I think they are bigger.  Its certainly harder for me to avoid them and doesnt quite feel fair.  
* Space Harrier - 12/17/19 - This was a purchase that I dont regret at all back in the day I loved this game and played it a lot.  I loved the graphics and the controls and especially teh music.  I even got high scores.  Its so good. Plus theres a WHDLoad for Unlimited Lives!  Yay!  This one gave you 9-10 lives but I don't honestly think thats enough to beat the game ... although I'm sure there are examples of people doing that on youtube.  I remember being able to get to the 3rd or 4th level and back then I was so proud of that.  Really that means I got 5-10 minutes of play time progress and that was rare for my Amiga gaming back then.  I just beat the first boss with 5 mans left!  Its so great having this classic pumping music with the FX as well and the Get Ready.  I also love the look of the mushroom enemies on level 3.  OOOH and the high score music is really nice and I love it.  1049460.  On second thought I think if I really spent the time with it I could get really far even if I had to play it over and over.  
* Space Harrier - Return to Fantasy Zone - 12/17/19 - Is this an expansion with new levels??? It is exactly the same engine.  The get ready sound is different, and the levels are different and the enemies are mixed up.  I wonder if its like a rom hack but official or something.  Well its cool too, although I don't really need more space harrier. 
* Street Fighter II - 12/17/19 - Well this is one of the biggest gaming related disappointments of my childhood.  I bought this the month it came out for the Amiga because I absolutely loved playing it in the arcade and then at toms house on the SNES and I had rented it for the Genesis and spent quite a bit of time with it even though the controls were wonky.  I remember talking to Tom and other friends about how awesome it was going to be and looking at screenshots in magazines (which were small and I dont think they were representative) and thinking the following (obviously flawed) thoughts: "Wow the SNES only has 256 colors but the Amiga can display 4096 colors at once.  Can you imagine how good this game is going to look with thousands more colors!  its going to be exactly like the arcade".  I think in the back of my mind I wondered how they were going to make it work with only one  button (huge disadvantage that held it back from successfully hosting sophisticated ports imho) but I ignored that because at the time I didnt think we would get a SNES anytime soon.  We did probably 1 year later however I for some reason never bought my own copy of Street Fighter 2 even though I thought it was the pretty much the coolest game ever.  I was so fucking excited to buy that and bring it home from the store.  The box art was not as cool as I thought it would be though not problematic just not bad ass imho.  I paid full price I remember it being $50.  My first glimpse of disappointment was when I laid eyes on the character select map.  What a cartoony joke.  Then I saw the character profiles and thought "Thats not 4096 colors" and although they are all recognizable the profiles were small and not so clear and kind of sloppy looking.  Looking at it now with my current expectations its not so jarring honestly.  The in game graphics are not terrible honestly.  They did a good job with the limited color palette.  The backgrounds are washed out somewhat.  the characters are pretty big.  Its kind of choppy, not too slow.  I feel like the resolution is low, but I wonder what it is compared to the SNES?  It looks lower.  Certainly there are many fewer colors on screen and the shading on the characters on the SNES was so much more convincing.  I suspect the biggest problems were the shading and detail on the characters and backgrounds combined with the choppy animation.  Maybe its not choppy animation but maybe it is just slow?  I dont feel like they did a terrible job with it its just a lot for a relatively old computer.  That plus the control scheme was inherently lacking.  At least a 2 button mode is built in!   The load times were long too which was really boring for Tom and me when we played it.  He was supportive and excited but it was ultimately (well quickly) disappointing. 
* Street Fighter - 12/17/19 - I bought this game boxed for PC in like 1992 and I remember thinking how shitty it was.  Now I had never played this in the arcades (and still havent honestly) and Tom said it was pretty cool in the arcades and I'm sure it was but on DOS it was really shitty.  The sprite was tiny and round and cartoony and the responsiveness sucked and it was really hard.  Believe it or not I still enjoyed it somewhat and played it a decent amount because it was fun trying to figure out how to survive with the limited movement and moves and the slow responsiveness.  I remember pulling off a fireball like 1 time ever maybe 2 or 3 but not much.  I remember you could fight any of the players and I beat them all at least once except I'm not sure I ever beat birdy.  Here's the [Dos Version] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ach7ekDFVSo).  Back to the Amiga I watched Zeusdaz shit all over this game in a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBae5K5URIY&list=PLwNreNhW7CggPRyQKQLfklqwZi6s2J0eh) and I'm excited to see what he means about how bad it is.  The sprites in this are vastly superior to the sprites on dos.  This isn't as bad as I expected.  Hey I beat Japan!  Hey I beat Joe!  Whoa Mike is Mike Tyson I think and he destroyed me with 3 punches.  I beat the first on the Chinese level.  About half of the time that I try to punch it doesnt respond.  Also if you punch and the enemy is actually at the end of the range of your punch it doesnt connect, but if its just beyond the range then it does connect.  If the enemy is slightly closer than the end of your fist then it does not connect but it leaves you open to a punch from them which does connect.    The collision is terrible.  I lost to mike because he punched past the end of my foot during a kick and it took 1/3 of my life.  Hey I beat China too!  I beat Japan again but I dont think I used anything except strong punch with a few kicks.  I dont know if you can do strong medium or light or how to do that with 1button.  Well I'm actually having fun with this.  I almost beat mike just now.  Hes really cheap.  I bet Birdie is really hard.  we will see.  he was def hard on the DOS version.  Ok I knocked down mike.  lets see if I can clutch a win.  Nope.  3 hits killed.  It seems like going back and away and kicking seems to catch him.  some down some away.  YES!  Got him!  Ok Birdie: Zeus was right.  If you take your hand off the stick and just hit punch over and over you will win.  I won two rounds that way.  Final Character to beat every character in the game: Eagle.  So for the whole game. Lots of punches (button with no direction) and lots of back and down and attack.  Eagle didnt even hit me with my sweep.  I wonder if all the inputs are getting lost because its not polling fast enough?  I wonder if I run my faster Amiga if it will be more reliable?  Ok I made it to Thailand.  I beat the first but Sagat is huge and his kick is so long and he shoots fireballs.  2 hits and I was dead.  In the third round I jumped and before I could land or throw any attack I only had 1/3 of my life!  its bs.  
* Stunt Car Racer - 12/17/19 - Even though I love 3d graphics like this I never thought this would be good or fun and when I tried it I remember not liking it because I couldn't control it.  I never practiced at all though.  Now this says its by Geoff Crammond of Grand Prix game fame which is a good sign since that is a big hit game.  Hey I won a race!  Thats really fucking good!  Its fun and simple I love it.  I wish I had bought this bitd.  Now I dont know what the continue structure is but it seems like you dont have to beat every race without losing and it seems you can race in different like divisions or something.  
* Supercars 2 - 12/17/19 - WHDLoad lets you select starting track number or something and theres a cheat mode too.  Coming soon (in the opening credits) Lotus Turbo Challenge 2!  Harrison ford is your TV host haha! Hey this is really good!  Plus there are missiles!  Its simpler than the other one but very good too.  Wow there are jumps and you can upgrade your car.  Its more straightforward.  It makes more sense to a new player.  The damage isnt separated out.  I love this.  Well its not so easy on the 4th race.  I got 5th place. Plus I screwed up some trivia and lost 4 point sin the tournament :( I think though if I had this as a kid I would have eaten it up and played it over and over.  Also theres is auto acceleration which makes it kind of easier.  
* SWIV - 12/17/19 - I loved this game as a kid and bought it boxed without knowing much about it but I'm so glad.  It was a great game. I didn't realize that part of the reason it is great is because of its great explosion sounds but Zeus pointed that out.  As a kid I eventually got to a huge laser boss and I got just past that today too.  What a great game.  
* Superstar Ice Hockey - 12/17/19 - This was in the Confessions of an Amiga Addict article and I remember buying it and enjoying it a bit but maybe it crashed or there was copy protection or it wouldnt save or something but also I wasnt good at it at first so I never spent a ton of time with it.  I like the SportTime Garden intro screen.  Well its hard but actually I like it. I think its pretty damn good.  The animation and feel is actually fantastic and not like I remember it at all.  I remember it being clunky but its not at all.  Maybe it was load times that took forever?  I dont know but this is really good.  Now its good but i don't want to have to learn a bunch of skills to beat a match.  Did I pick a poor team or something?  So I reset the league and I hope that will make it easier.  The other team was way faster than me.  Hmm Its also cool how the puck bounces off of the goal.  I like it but I can't play it.  I might be doing something wrong but even in my first practice match of the league I'm like half the speed of the other team.  all of my players are.  so the other team is passing it back and forth and accelerating and turning quickly and i'm still trying to stop going one direction and turn the other.  Thats not so much fun.  Maybe theres a way to fix that though?  
* Superfrog CD32 - 12/17/19 - Whoa cool theres a level code!  That means the continue structure on this game is excellent!  I love how he hangs from the top of the screen for an instant when its the next life because his head is the life marker at the top of the screen.  So classy.  You know something to do with the CD32 pad makes the game pause sometimes when I'm jumping?  At least the jump button works.  The gambling is pretty cheap.  YOu dont win often enough for it to be fun.  Theres an infinite life cheat!  
* Superfrog 12/17/19 - You can bounce on the spring higher than the cd32 version!?!   World 1-2 complete!  I am 90% sure that the CD32 version had a shooting direction problem.   This game has a problem where its got this green ball shot but most of the enemies are lower than it.  Its stupid.  It can shoot up and diagonal but why wouldnt it hit the things that are right next to you when you shoot straight?  I beat world 1-3!  I haven't even died I dont think.  I beat world 1-4.  This is a cool game and I would have loved the hell out of this.  I regret not buying this bitd.  I would have actually been able to make progress with this game and would have eventually beat a real Amiga game and would have been so proud.  Wait ... how do you get a level code??? are they in the game?  If not then the continue structure isnt as golden as I thought.  I didnt see any level codes offered to me and I was looking.  My score was 303050.   There is an infinite lives code in WHDLoad 
* Super Hang On - 12/17/19 -  1986 sega - Well this is ok. I like that it has mouse control and thast not bad at all.  No Second Prize is just way better though.  This could have been great but the time between checkpoints is too tight for it to be fun.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong, is there a brake key?  yes!  Its the space bar.  Let me try again that could make a big difference on certain corners.  Its real abrupt when you dont get to the checkpoint.  Lets see about the music.  Its not so good.  It probably barely resembles the arcade music.  Its not bad just simple and not powerful or pumping.    This really isnt bad at all.   I just dont know.  After several rounds of practice I could only get through the 2nd or third checkpoint.  Its just not satisfying.  one or two bumps and you lose all progress.  This is on the easiest maps too.
* Strider - 12/17/19 - I loved this so much in the arcade that I wanted it really bad for Amiga.  I felt for sure that the Amiga would be the best arcade port.  I would have been so excited to own this honestly.  Lets find out.  Its got some speech "You dare fight me?"  Ok good graphics but ... the sprites are tiny compared to the arcade.  The play area is just the top 2/3 of the screen unfortunately but they can make that work.  Everything moves so slow, especially his falling to the ground, its floaty.  its really hard to make progress without getting hit because the enemies are so sloppy and the jumping is so weird.  3 lives.  No continues.  Piece of shit.  I wanted this but I'm really glad I never bought it. 
* Strider 2 - 12/17/19 - Did I own this?  I feel like maybe I did, but I don't remember playing it even once.  I must not have but some part of me says I did.  weird.  This is by Tiertex who famously made the terrible Street Fighter that Zeusdaz hates so much.  This is crazy bad.  Theres a timer that goes really fast and you cant tell what you can jump on and you cant avoid enemy fire.  The sprite looks smaller than the previous game and more cartoony with a black outline.  
* Speedball 2 - 12/17/19 - This was a famously amazing game.  Lets see if I like it as much as Speedball 1.   Well its cool you can do replays, and the pitch is much larger than the first game.   Yeah I lost but I did score a goal and am proud and thats a fantastic game. 
* Stardust - 12/17/19 - 1993 Bloodhouse.  I always wanted to buy this and thought it would be so cool just from the screenshots.  Lets see if its great and if then I regret not buying it.  WHOA!  Its got yellow distance copper scrolling text ala Star Wars.  Thats a fucking great effect!  That couldn't have been done without some copper wizardry.  Nice work guys!  its got an epic intro and cool background.  what?  Theres a password system?  thats intriguing?  Does this mean the continue structure here isn't broken???  Well damn.  I'm not able to skip the intro or start the game.  It doesnt seem to accept any of my input.  well its workign this time for some reason (although I still couldnt skip the intro) and its a good game!  I dont know where the passwords come in but I'll try to beat a segment of the galaxy and see if that gives me a password.  I dont like that each asteroid takes multiple hits to kill because it makes them somewhat unsatisfying.  Well I dont love this.  I liked it but dont love it.  I tried twice and got some good gameplay out of the game each time, but I couldnt beat the first sector.  I think a third time might be the charm but I'm not in the mood. I got to the boss though and am proud of that.  Ok I'm going to try again.  You twisted my arm.  Hey I'm able to skip the intro now!  No.  I couldn't do it.  I really wanted to like this game but I'm glad I didnt buy it back then.  
* Super Stardust AGA - 1994 - 12/17/19 - This game has a similar intro, but also has a bunch of WHDLOad cheats which is nice.  It also has a different background since its the sequel.  You can only go up to 5 lives not 7 like the previous game Somewhat better graphics but exactly the same problems.  Not satisfying shooting making it no fun, also makes it too hard since you cant clear the field even when you are aiming correctly, and the continue structure is too far between passwords.  This could have been so great and the screenshots betrayed the players.  The PS3 game was fucking awesome in 3d though!
* Sword of Sodan - 12/17/19 - 1988/1989 man I wanted this game so bad just from the screenshots.  I loved big beautiful graphics and I feel like I woudl have liked this.  Lets find out if it was fair at all and if it was fun.  I played this a few years ago and remember thinking how clumsy the combat is and maybe thats true but lets see if its still fun after all.  I like this and I think I would have liked it back then (though not for $50!).  I would have gotten frustrated but with some practice would have gotten bettter. Zeus loves this game and I can see why.  I like how its kind of like Golden Axe in the way it presents the story.  I don't like how clumsy the combat is and I'm not looking forward to finding out what the continue structure is.  I got to the big guy at the end of level 2.  I like this and I think I could get better at it and enjoy it.  
* Starglider 2 - 1988 - 12/18/19 - Wow this is great intro screen music!  I dont remember that!  Curtis at Computerwise was always amazed by this game and when I told him I owned it he thought it was cool and said it was a really cool game.  I remember that.  I remember not knowing what to do at all bitd, but watching a video recently apparently theres a story to unfold by finding things in a large universe and in a maze of areas that look all alike.  haha in the turbo mode it kills you instantly.  Its too complicated for me to figure out right now but its really cool that a game like this with this kind of 3d world with planets and space travel and everything can be on a slow Amiga like this.  It says you can save your game too I dont know if you can save at any point but if so thats pretty amazing.  Lets see if I can find out.  Yikes ESC kills the game instantly without warning.  OH damn you can actually 'restart an interrupted game'  wow!  Yeah damn the save works!  Its a bit too clumsy for 2019 but huge respect to this game being made back then.  
* Team Suzuki - 12/18/19 - The interface here is really pro and well done.  Really slick and smooth.  The 3d is amazing.  Its really good in a lot of ways.  Apparently theres acceleration and braking but to try to do it and keep up with all of the opponents is virtually impossible.  you have to go way too fast for anyone to do it casually on the first race.  
* TinyTroops - 12/18/19 - Vulcan game so I owned this on the CD Rom collection that I had bought.  Really cool animated intro with lots of text.  I heard this was cool and it looked cool.  Apparently you can save your game.  its some kind of real time strategy with nice colors and graphics and a pretty good early 90s interface.  
* Technocop - 12/18/19 - oh cool!  Its a Lamborghini Countach!  This is an interesting game.  You race the clock to make it to the location and then play a slow paced bloody platformer where you can actually kill kids and probably prostitutes and when you kill enemies they explode in a wash of blood.  The shooting is ok and you can take a decent number of hits before you die.  It looks like you get 5 lives.  
* Toyota Celica GT Rally - Gremlin 12/18/19 - Since this is from Gremlin it might be pretty good.  Apparently there are saved games in this game.  Its 3d but I played it with the mouse and although its cool you can use the mouse its not great like I expected.  
* T2 the arcade game - 12/18/19 - I like the presentation and that there is mouse support.  Its pretty good!  Its too hard in the sense that theres no way you can hit everyone and avoid damage, but maybe if you practice you could get good enough that you could pass the levels.  I didnt beat the first level but it was fun while it lasted and the mouse controls were actually really good.  I thought it was bunk that the terminators that showed up real close took so damn many hits it made it so you couldn't hit anyone else.   
* Terminator 2 Judgement Day - 12/18/19 - Has the intro music but its a bit of a mess.  No I dont think it is the same music.  Its similar sound though and intense with some cool movie screen caps.  Its an LJN game so James would be pissed.  The timing of the music is real weird.  Lets see what the game is like.  Well its kind of dumb.  The first part is a fist fight and if you beat htat then theres a crappy overhead motorcycle chase scene with cheap obstacles everywhere.  
* tass times in tonetown - 12/18/19 - 1986 I played this on C64.  or maybe I didnt this is nothing like what I had in my head.  This is sort of a text adventure with graphcis and commands ... I dont get it.  One cool thing is I think it has a bunch of text shortcuts assigned tot he F-keys.   
* Treasure Island Dizzy - 12/18/19 - I don't anticipate enjoying this but lets give it a shot. no I dont know wtf to do and its not fun jumping around.   
* Tower Toppler - ugh its not a nice reminder of 9-11 when the opening screen of a commercial airliner given the title of the game.  Its just wierd in hindsight it doesnt mean anything.  This is just nebulus and I didnt like it.  I died so quick.  
* UFO Enemy Unknown CD32 - 12/18/19 - Microprose - I dont know what this game is about but I'm intrigued by the title alone.  Cool colorful cityscape and intro animation looks like a marvel movie.  I like hte intro withits kick ass music and theme and animations.  You can load saved games which is nice.  Whoa the 3d earth is awesome!  Problem is I have no idea what is going on.  It talks about xcom is this related to xcom?  Oh yeah it sure is.  This is the first XCOM game.  That means I probably wont like it and it will probably be pretty hard to get into.  
* UFO Enemy Unknown AGA - 12/18/19 - Lets see how different this is.  No intro movie.  And it had copy protection.  well it lets you save easily but it loosk like thats not working in this build.  
* Tetris Mirrorsoft - 12/19/19 - 1987 Goofy silly intro music.  This is back when a game as currently ubiquitous as this would be a full priced game.  Hmm it says current level 5.  Well if you're expecting traditional russian style music you will be disappointed even though theres a slightly russian picture on the title screen art, but the music is actually pretty good, and its got a real weird random pattern background to the playefield, but it plays well and has a cool 3d effect and keeps stats about which blocks are in your playfield.  Its pretty good.  Allows joystick or keyboard and the only problem with joystick is its so easy to accidentaly tag the down button and drop the piece when you didnt want to.  
* Tetris Infogrames - 12/19/19 - this one wont run in turbo mode.  well or apparently in any mode
* Theme Park - 1994 Bullfrog - 12/19/19 - I like that you can select whether its your first game or not and I presume it will then walk you through it.  Its cool that you have to spread over the whole world with a series of theme parks.  Well I locked up the tutorial by accidentallyd eleteing my bounce house but I couldn't figure out how to continue.   Let me try again with the AGA version.
* Theme Park AGA - 1994 Bullfrog - 12/19/19 - this has an animated intro with a cool tv show.  Ok the graphics are quite a bit more detailed and better.   The tutorial is real fussy.  I've messed it up several times now but its not totally clear what to click (although I think the lack of clarity is a bug) Its cool that you can trade shares in your park and adjust ticket prices and ride and treat costs and hire fun characters to hang out and hire people to repair things.  I think I would have actually loved this as a kid.  Its fun and deep but also accessible.  I remember being aware of this but dont remember thinking that I would love it but I think I would have.
* Top Gear 2 - 1994 Gremlin - 12/19/19 - Well the controls are nice and the graphics are pretty good and it lets you race for quite a while but I didnt make many mistakes and I was in 6th place on the first race and 9th on the second.  Its ok but not great.  I loved Top Gear for the SNES (first played it at Toms place and loved it) and the music in that game is amazing.  This game the music is ok but there arent sfx and its just not as good.  I beat that game at some point.  
* Top Gear 2 AGA - 1994 Gremlin - 12/19/19 - Cool that there is a password system and then a country select.  THat means the continue system is pretty good.  This looks pretty good maybe a bit better than the others.  I dont know it looks about the same. 
* Top Gear 2 CD32 - 1994 Gremlin - 12/19/19 - Ok with some clever use of nitros I was able to get first place and I had a fun time in this first face.  I think this is a good game and with that good continue structure I might have had fun with it.  Now the CD32 version fortunately did use all of the buttons and the acceleration, brake, and nitro were separate buttons, but what blows the mind is they put the acceleration and the nitro on opposite sides so you can't easily tap both at once.  so silly.  Still this is good.  
* TV Sports Boxing - 12/19/19 - Its got a wonderful menu which when you push the button it punches the menu item.  So clever and classy!  Well its pretty damn cool. The graphics are good and I have a feeling that the fighting is at least decent and I suspect that with some practice somebody could figure out how to hit and block, but i just got my ass kicked royally! 
* TV Sports Football - 12/19/19 - Wow this game was a big deal bitd, it looked so real and I wanted to play it so much.  I didn't even really like football but I still wanted to play it.  Even the coin toss is classy and with great graphics.  It has great graphics and the players move really fast (maybe even a bit too fast) but I can't figure out how to really control it although I stink at games like this and always have.  
* TV Sports Basketball - 12/19/19 the toss up is really well done from a cool angle.  The graphics are reallly great and I would have liked this just to show off the graphics bitd.  I dont like that the perspective changes as you travel mid court but it seems like a good game and its probably pretty fun once you get used to it.  
* TV Sports Baseball - 12/19/19 - I like the pitching aiming with the baseball moving back and forth.  This is a good game. I feel like I would have had fun with this as a kid and even liked it more than Championship baseball.  For some reason this game felt to me so good and fancy that I didn't deserve it or something.  I remember it being expensive, but I would have actually loved it it would have felt like a luxury and like I was spoiling myself.  
* Total Recall Image - 12/19/19 - Its got a cool intro well it moves pretty well, but the combat is no good and weird.  The graphics are actually crisp and really nice for time like that.  
* Total Carnage AGA - 12/19/19 - its not that fun and the graphics are kind of clunky.  
* Three Stooges - 12/19/19 - The Three Stooges starts out with the Defender of the Crown logo hahaha!  The graphics are really cool for what they are.  great stylized graphics.  hmm its real weird.  I dont really know what to do.  
* Thomas the Tank Engine - 12/19/19 - I'm not quite sure why I'm playing this.  You know what I recognize the music though.  Theres a normal and a hard mode.  There isn't an easy mode.  I hope they've properly balanced this for kids.  haha well the graphics are good and the controls are ok you just move a train and choose which track to go on and try not to bump any other trains.  its not as bad as it could have been and would probably entertain kids for a while.  
* Thomas the Tank Engine Pinball AGA - 12/19/19 - Spidersoft?  Why do I know them?   Wait theres a pinball game in here?  Oh this is all pinball!  and its pretty good pinball actually!  I didnt see the title correctly when I first fired it up.
* Thomas the Tank Engine 2 - 12/19/19 - its a cute idea a racing game on the train tracks.  Not too bad for a kids game. 
* Thundercats - 1988 - 12/19/19 -  well its pretty crappy and only has 5 lives and no continues.  Ugh.  But for a few minutes its fun its one hit kills.  
* Trivial Pursuit - 12/19/19 - Didnt run
* Trolls HD+ (ECS) - 12/19/19 - Wow there are tons of cheats. Well Its a platformer with decent graphics and controls but I dont know what to do and its not fun.  
* Turbo - 12/19/19 - I played this not too long ago.  oh nope actually I didn't this is a super basic game of race and shoot and its not that fun but it is at least two players simultaneous which is cool.  
* Toki - 12/19/19 - I played this on NES and liked it although I didnt ever get terribly far.  whoa there is a nipslip in the opening screen but this is a kids game about a monkey!  Its got a WHDLoad trainer and 2 button control setting.  This is an interesting game.  Its not too bad.  It is one hit death and thats just old fashioned 80s style.  The shooting is ok and the controls are fine.  Its not too difficult to make progress.  The continue structure seems ok.  I dont know if there are limited continues but if not then we have somewhat of a winner here because it starts you off at invisible checkpoints not too far back which is nice until you lose your 5 lives and then you continue at the beginning of the level.  I got prettty far and if I had played more time I think I could beat the level.  Its pretty hard though to get everything right there are alot of things that you couldn't possibly see coming so you have to learn by dying.  
* Toobin - 12/19/19 - I played this only on Evans and Vals PC (although I dont really know how that game got there and nothing else was there haha).  I think I love the music for this style of game its just perfect and fun.   Its actually pretty darn fun.  There are only a few credits unfortunately.  
* Thunderblade 1988/1989 Sega - 12/19/19 - I owned this on C64 and I could actually make some progress on it so I absolutely loved it.  Well this version seems pretty good, and I got to the rear view part but ... then it crashed.  Its not bad.  It ran way too fast on my slowest a4000 but my slowest a1200 was ok.  
* Temple Of Apshai Trilogy - 12/19/19 - 1986 I had this on my C64 and liked it a bit and was able to make a bit of progress at least.  Oh cool you can select any level!  Its a cool dungeon crawl.  Its got cool text data for background and lots of weapons and stuff.  
* Test Drive 2 - 12/19/19 - I dont know if I ever had this one but I always knew it was really cool.  At this point I didnt like it that much.  It didnt have a Countach!  It was actually pretty smooth to drive, but I ran out of gas so fast and was supposed to pull over.  I have like 5 lives.  Its really not too bad.  
* Test Drive - 12/19/19 - I did own this on C64 and I loved it so much even though I never made much progress on it.  I thought it was so cool and felt like I was in one of these actual supercars!  I remember it took forever to load on C64 and I remember it beign really slow and hard to control.  It was always hard to drive around other cars and avoid the edge.  I feel like its not much different now but I also feel like it would take a lot of practice to get anywhere but I saw Zeusdaz do it the other day.  Maybe I could do it.  If you shift down too much then you crash. 
* Tearaway Thomas - 12/19/19 - I remember the first time I saw this demo at the Amiga Users Group I was blown away and wanted it so bad.  Before I actually play it I would say I'm sad that I didn't buy it back then because I feel like I would have liked it so much.  So far I'm on level 3 and havent died and its really fun.  I wonder if theres a cheat on because I keep hitting animals and not losing a heart.  Its simple but it really works. You just have to collect a certain number of gems then the exit opens then you find the exit and you're good.  Theres a timer too!  No you lose a life when you run out of time.  this is a great game so much fun!  I remember seeing it the first time and it was so cool it blew my mind.  So I guess hitting the enemies just dazes you and slows you down a bit making it harder to beat the level.  I suspect when you lose your lives you start over but at least this would have been a game I could have made progress on, repeatedly.  Its so much different when there aren't direct consequences for hitting the animals and making mistakes.   Yeah it gets difficult by the 4th stage to actually collect all of the crystals in time.  I still would have had fun with this though.  its great.  
* Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles COp - 12/19/19 - WHD Load for Unlimited Credits.  I loved the arcade game so much that I think I would have liked this almost no matter what even if it hadn't had many credits.  Lets see if I'm right.  Hey its two player and the character select screen looks great.  THe music is great.  OMG the intro amnimation looks fantastic!  wow the sprite colors of raphael are so weird.  his headband is usually brown, only occasionally red.  The rest of his pads are blue!?!   Its super buggy.  You can jump with button plus up or up right but when you come down you make the kicking motion but it doesnt hit any enemies!?! At least hitting the bad guys they go down pretty easy, but really they dont get slashed anything like in the arcade so that part really isnt that similar.  It looks great though.  There are only 3 credits.  It kind of sucks.  
* Times of Lore - 12/19/19 - 1988 Origin.  I love PacBillys play of this (even though its not done yet).  He was playing the C64 version which given 8bit hardware is a work of art and so impressive. I wanted this game so bad bitd and its one of those games where I wanted it so bad I dont really know why I didnt get it.  I remember that the life candle was just so damn cool.  Made by the Wing Commander guy Chris Roberts.  It says you can return to times of lore (loading an old game) The graphics on the story screen arent too different form the C64 graphics they just have a few more colors.  Well at this point in 2019 theres something here thats such a huge problem I dont want to continue.  Its not the tiny play space or the slow walking or the ancient interface, its the collision detection which makes every corner a pain in the ass and makes all movement clumsy as hell.  you can be 3-4 pixels away from something and hit it and have to back.  You know what ... the C64 version was better in some ways since the audio had reverb when you went indoors and this one doesnt!?!  It hardly looks any diifferent at all to my eyes, probably a bit clearer from one pixel to another.
* Tetrix - I remember having this game but oh ... no I didnt have this.  This is just wonderful.  I just spent 10 minutes in it and time just flew.  Its a puzzle like it gives you little puzzles to solve and you have to clear that pattern.  Its just great!  it plays great and feels great and looks great.  I'm really happy about it. 
* ThunderStrike - 12/19/19 - I dont know what possessed me to buy this bitd but this is one of the games I had the most fun with on the Amiga.  I remember spending hours with it because it was something I could actually make progress with and get further and further.  Perhaps part of the reason is that my Amiga was so slow.  Now with a faster Amiga I wonder if it will be better or worse.  I remember the frame rate being incredibly choppy but that might be part of what made it playable.  it has a cool intro.  I haven't played it in 20 years!  I did so great on level 1.  It was fun!  I remember you have to either shoot down the structures or I seem to remember having to collect certain diamonds and move them to other locations.  I also remember a cool highway around the outer edges.  This was my first experience with any kind of 3d movement at all and I loved it so much and it looks like I still do!  It keeps lots of statistics.  Its really good.  The diamonds on top of the pyramids is what they are trying to do before I destroy their generators.  Destroying the generators and the enemies results in a win.  I'm doing pretty good here and I haven't died yet and its a blast.  I wonder if I will get my power refilled between levels.  Yes it does!  The news screen between levels is pretty great and really immerses you in the game.  I love the graphics so much.  I like how the ship goes up and down the controls are excellent.  I'd say the only thing that could be improved is that the camera follows the floor height and as a result bounces up and down a bit much.  Wow you can get upgrades to your weapons too!  I'm way better now then I was back then.  You can get on the highway as kind of a save zone and just zoom around a bit as long as you aren't too concerned that the enemy pyramids wont get those diamonds installed on top.  Round 4 Cleared.  It is getting hard but its still fun.  I almost lost my last base.  Problem: It has a target hit rate which is increasing.  I don't know if I'll be able to keep that up.  Round 5 cleared.  Uh oh I was wrong.  It doesn't refill your energy.  Thats kind of a big deal.  Still as games go this is a great one!  I beat Round 5 but didn't have much energy by the time I got to 6 I blew up quickly.  
* Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles - 1990 - 12/19/19 - I remember ordering the TMNT the arcade game from Computerwise and they brought me this.  They said well go home and try it out and if you dont like it bring it back.  Well I tried it for a few days but had to return it after a few days because it was no good and just like the NES game.  I was actually a bit stung by it not coming in as the arcade game because then they said they couldn't get the arcade game and I had to kind of give up on it.  I was pretty bummed about that.  If I had found a way to order the arcade game i woudl have been disappointed for different reasons but I would have been more satisfied than this.  THe graphics are good though.  I didnt want the NES game because it just pissed me off so bad bitd when I rented it several times even if it has some good memories for me.  I really wanted to like the NES one and this one.  Wow it says theres a saved level in the game? what does that mean???  well I dont know but its worse than I thought.  Its got much better graphics though but I have a soft spot for those sprites from the NES game.  There are several problems here.  1. unavoidable ninja stars come from off the left or right side of the screen and theres no way to block them and you can jump over them but to jump over them means to take damage from something right above you.  Its shitty. Its shittier than the unavoidable damage when you go into one of the holes.  Big problem though: the pizzas dont come back when you leave the hole.  That means theres no way to recharge so you have to make almost no mistakes.  It takes away one of the few decent things that made the first few levels tolerable.  The music is really weird.   Its the same theme but it sounds like they converted it almost automatically like they converted it in code or something.  The instruments dont go to the correct pitches to make the top note of the melody on the overworld theme for example.  also due to joysticks you have to hit enter to get to the menu to switch turtles so you can't really do it in the heat of battle like you can on the NES game.  
* Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - 12/20/19 - well believe it or not this is worse than hero turtles (this is the actual one I got from computerwise come to think of it since we're getting specific).  with this one you have to hit the button and then up to jump.  and if you hold the button and jump into an orange wall (like in the sewer that crosses the first river) and attack you kind of get stuck on it and if you then push up you just get stuck there with almost no way out with leonardo just swinging his sword overhis head crazily.  None of my button presses will get me down.  A problem that I didnt notice in hero turtles is that the purple guys take a whole segment of life and hit you from far outside their visible hitbox.  
* Titus the Fox - theres a WHDLoad for infinite lives.  I always thought I would love this game just based on the screenshots.  When I thought that about most platform games I imagined that they would have some similarities to Mario and be of a similar level of difficulty and with a similar achievable continue structure which in hindsight wasnt usually true.  Well at lesat in this case theres a password system.  whoa I got a code like 20 seconds in to the game.  Does it work?  2625 well its a beginning of the game code.  Will the other codes be reasonably spaced?  Theres a pretty forgiving life bar, you can't attack the enemies in any way which is kind of weird but theyre not hard to avoid.  Update: thats not true anymore just a little further into the level.  Also I got to the end of the screen but ... it wont let me out.  Theres probably something I need to do but theres no GUI indication of any collectables or anything.  You only get 2 lives.  I think I found the final piece but died.  There are at least checkpoints during the levels looks like every time you pick up a piece.  The homeless guys tossing bottles are unavoidable.  OK I pushed left and the button to exit the level!?!  I dont understand.  Knockback is insane.  I guess I died and game is over.  this stinks. 
* Trog!  12/20/19 - Did I play this on NES? or maybe C64?  WHDLoad unlimited lives/time/health.  Theres an option on screen one for a 2 button joystick it looks like.  3 lives no continues.  Its just like adventure island.   Its just different sprites and levels but almost the same game. I didnt get to a skateboard though. 
* Trolls AGA 12/20/19 - This has a pretty extensive trainer built in.  well just like the other one I couldn't get anywhere.  
* Turbo Outrun - 12/20/19 - Lots of WHDLoad cheats.  The intro screen looks childish. well its no good.  I got through the first city but then moving on to going to DC the cops were chasing me and there were cheap obstacles everywhere and the time limit was very low so I have 4 credits remaining to beat the whole game.  
* Turrican 3 Demo - 12/20/19 - The atmosphere in this level is fantastic due to the graphics and the animated drippings.  Zeus doesnt like this 3rd title.  This is kind of terrible.  Every pit leads to instant death and restarting of the whole level no matter how far you got and this level is mostly pit.  In fact it took me a few minutes to figure out how to get past the second jump.  It should give you some feeling of success before frustrating you!  I took it as a personal challenge to figure it out and I did but thats not fun.  You have to roll into a ball and then scoot off the edge fast and then jump out of ball form at just the right time before you fall into the pit.  the shooting is pretty good and the enemies aren't placed too terribly.  the life meter goes down too quick though.  Most destructive enemy on this level?  The bubble.  oh damn one cool thing is it respects the second button for a super attack which the space bar does otherwise.  ok at least there are some checkpoints.  Wait I got to a point where it drowned me and sent me back to the beginning of the level.  Did I run out of lives?  Theres something really compelling about this demo. Update: that drowning was just the end of the demo.  
* Turrican 3 - 12/20/19 - oh sweet its got two button controls one for jump!  Thats amazing! I was actually thinking "Why wont he jump!?!" when I pressed up because I'm so used to it now :).  I remember the first time I had to do that in like hoi or zool or something it was so unbelievably confusing and felt so wrong.  It kind of made me mad.  I felt like I shouldn't have to deal with this blatant disregard for convention and I definitely played those games less as a result.  If I had accepted that as the way it was for those games I would have spent more time with them and eventually learned to do the jumping.  Our joysticks weren't that good back then though so that was another problem.  The graphics are wonderful and detailed.  Just as good as any SNES or Genesis game.  That roll fast and then jump at teh last second has proved critical even on this first level of this game which is excessive to me.  If I hadn't learned it from the demo I would have been angry and frustrated and felt stupid because I would have thought that they had stuck me in a dead mans trap.  They don't spend any time showing you how to play which means the barrier to entry is exceedingly high compared to mario or even metroid.  The music is great.  I like the pacing of this game.  The level is sprawling and huge and interesting.  Now there was a platform that smashed me against the ceiling killing me which was cheap since the previous one didnt do that and there was a flame after it so you had to wait. Thats cheap learn by dying stuff, but thats the first time they've done that exact thing.  I did beat a huge dragon boss!   Pride!  I beat a second boss and got t o a purple level with a little cute chime and 3 lives left!  Yay!!!  I ran out of time but it started me off right where I died!  Now I'm on a new level I heard another chime and am on a new purple level.  I beat teh flesh blob boss!!!  I got a score tally screen!!  NOw new music and I'm on a yellow level.  Oh!  this is the demo level!  Oh damn!  I got past the demo level adn still had 2 lives but I was on an octoboss but I did the super attack and it crashed!  This was damn fun!  I loved this.  
* Turrican 2 Demo - 12/20/19 - This also has 2 button support not for jump just for the super attack. This is a bit less sophisticated than 3 which may be why some people like it better and I can understand that.  I noticed that some background black cave wall occasionally is a platform and thats kind of deceiving to your eyes and sensibilities.  I'm also getting pretty lost.  This demo has 94 lives built in  Thats smart imho.   It took me several lives but I beat teh first robo-boss and thats such a cool boss!  Then it took me back to the beginning of level 1.
* Turrican 2 - 12/20/19 - Having beat the demo I'm seeing that this is a really cool game.  Whats cool about it?  Well 1. The controls are tight and excellent even for having just one button (even if this two button works which is rare).  The powerups are really cool.  The secrets are cool.  The sprite animation is cool.   you die quick but its actually fair if you give it some real time.  I believe I played a demo of this or the first one bitd and hated it because there were so many things that were new for me like the jumping mechanism and controlling the player and shooting and rolling and holding the button down and everything and the laser and after being hit no knockback or damage to the enemy and no grace period (a pretty big deal honestly) .  I didn't know back then how much to really use the laser or how to really go about playing it and its so different from anything else I played and especially mario or contra.  Its really cool that theres an arrow that points to the exit.  Theres a clumsy part where you are in a cave and the only way out is up and to the right but when you jump you hit your head on a virtually invisible cave ceiling.  if you step out onto the ledge its not hard but you have to know to do that and thats a bit cheap.  The learning curve for the game is definitely too steep.  These hard levels should have been interspersed with easy training levels.  I will want to play this with a trainer of lives to get good at it and see it through to the end.  The cheapest thing in the game is when one of the missile crawlers lands near you and just walks on your legs for like 1s draining your life the whole time.  Ok I didnt beat the first level on just the 5 given lives but I got decently far and I can see most of the map in my head now.  This is really good.  
* Turrican 2 CDTV 12/20/19 - Is this cool CD music?  no its the same.  WHOA This plays very much slower! is it a PAL NTSC thing??? This is more do-able with a bit slower pace.  Come to think of it that might be part of the problem with lots of european games in america, they didn't reprogram the pace of the game so they played faster here which they thought was a good thing since frame rate increased but it also increased the franticness of everything by a lot (20% is a lot!) which meant that every european game that people loved over there and that were playtested at that speed were much faster here and therefore much less forgiving.  Thats an interesting realization.  From some perspective they didn't really know how bad it was.  Ok I almost beat the first boss and I got top 10 turrican!  This is a really good game.  It has a cool cartoon intro!  Is this in the other version?  Wow theres a ton of text and graphics in this.  Bren Mc Guire is the only one left to save the galaxy.  He hurries to the equipment room and sights the new turrican fighting suits and shouts REVENGE!  
* Turrican Demo 12/20/19 - I love Zeus' story about this game how he took the train to a game shop and bought this based just on the box and had never heard of it and was so happy that he did.  This game also works with dual button! This demo has unlimited lives and I beat the fist boss!!!  I can do so good at this game with unlimited continues :) 
* Turrican NTSC - 12/20/19 - "Welcome to Turrican AHAHAHAA" thats awesome!  It says 3 continues.  Hey I beat the fist boss with 2 lives left!  
* Turrican - 12/20/19 - I got to the second or third level wiht 3 continues left where you fall down a shaft!  Proud!  
* Turrican CDTV - 12/20/19 - T2 version had a cool cutscene intro.  This one doesnt but that ok. 
* Ultima 3 - 1986 - 12/20/19 - The tiles in this game are really cool.  Sure its a simple way to do graphics but it works and makes it much simpler all around.  Oh man this is so tricky.  I wouldn't want 
* Ultima IV - 1988 - 12/20/19 - The tiles are like the same as in the previous game.  I wouldn't want to have bought this back then.  I like the background cutscenes.  Its cool how you create your character with answering questions.  Moving around is cool.  I am fundamentall lost.  
* Ultima V - This seems to be more of the same but more artistically designed
* Ultima VI - This one is way more modern.  It looks totally 80s too with the kid watching TV with a huge stereo and VCR and record player with records adn a heavy metal poster.  The graphics are completely different and somewhat isometric.  This visually makes more sense but i never spent the time to have those simple tiles make sense.  TO be clear this doesn't make much more sense.  I like that you have a lot of life and dont die easily.  If I was going to play a game like this I would play avernum.  There are so many documents that come with this game: solve, mapNW, magic, hints, cheat, addenda, story, spells, etc. 
* Universal Military Simulator - 1992 - 12/20/19 - Whoa its got a cool 3d terrain map!  Now moving around the map is pretty painful and today it would be point and click and drag but for the time its pretty cool how you can do that.  You walk through the simulation and it shows you what happened and how many casualties and exactly where it was on the map.  Its universal because there are many battles in history that this can simulate.  You can have humans controlling both sides.  I wonder if I can have computer controlling both?  This is pretty damn sophisticated.  It shows every direction each set of troops are moving.  
* Uninvited - 12/20/19 - I thought this was the Immortal and got confused.  This sucks its some early point and click game that is confusing and isn't fun. 
* Unreal NTSC - 12/20/19 back when the Unreal game by Epic came out in mid 90s I thought it was this game or was related to it.  This does look beautiful.  Lets see what its about.  the first level was like space harrier with less clarity but more lives and more dinosaurs.  The game said congratulations and it looks like I beat that level.  It loosk like its going side scrolling now.   Its cool when you die you get into training mode.  Its reasonably forgiving about getting hit but its kind of like sword of sodan or like shadow of the beast in terms of how crappy the gameplay is but how good the graphics are.  Whats cute is when you step on spikes its like they are a meat grinder and you slide into them in a spray of blood.  
* UN Squadron - 12/20/19 - OK I remember this being the name of a pretty good shooter in the US but I dont remember what.  I never would have bought this because the name would have turned me off.  Lets see if I would have missed out.  well its by Capcom which is usually good.   OK its cute and well drawn cartoony graphics and it seems to have some nice character to it.  I didnt like the shooting or the response to getting hit or the ability to dodge bullets.  it was on SNES as Area 88 which I think is how I heard about it.  
* Untouchables - 12/20/19 - Didn't I already play this?  Decent title screen.  Its an interesting platformer if only because
* Utopia - 12/20/19 - Gremlin?  Wow!  I wanted to buy this just based on some screenshots.  I always thought this was a really cool game even though I had only seen it on a screenshot.  I felt like it was going to be great like sim city.  At this point its just pretty confusing and I bet it wouldn't take long to figure out but its the littlest bit sluggish.  
* Utopia & New Worlds - 12/20/19 - Gremlin - This is exactly the same - probably some expansion.
* Ultimate Body Blows - 12/20/19 - 1994 You have to beat 22 characters with one with a dark secret.  It gives you instructions when you start playing which is nice if clumsy.  The animations in this game are so stiff.  They're not terrible and the graphics aren't bad.  
* Uridium 2 1MB - 12/20/19 - Its got really good graphical effects.  The text font is freaking amazing. I remember seeing an amazing making of article in one of the magazines and I wanted this game so bad.  I had played the first game on C64 a bit even though I didn't get very far.  Ok the graphics are really great and beautiful and hand drawn.  The gameplay is great, the difficulty however is unplayable.  I recently played and beat a modern spiritual successor to Uridium called Hyper Sentinel for iOS with an MFI Gamepad and it was fantastic.  It patched up all of the difficulty problems with this game and is more fun as a result.  I loved it very much.  This game is memorable and really 'cool' so cool, but almost unplayable. I did at least beat the first level.  
* Uridium 2 2MB - 12/20/19 - Well lets see how different this is and whether its got a good continue structure.  I dont see any difference between this and the 1MB version.  the continue structure stinks.  5 lives no continues.  You can apparently pick up more lives as you play and theres someone who has a longplay on youtube.  
* Vindicators 1988/1989 Tengen - 12/22/19 - I was always curious about this game.  Looks like its 2 players. Ok so its a tank game like combat in some ways.  the rotation is way too fast so fast its uncontrollable.  The graphics are cool if chunky, but as soon as you start even on easy mode you are getting pummelled from two directions so if you dont figure out how ot get them off of you in like 4 seconds you die.  Not to mention that your fuel (life) is constantly going down anyway.  Its kind of like gauntlet in the goals and maze aspect.  It starts out with much simpler mazes than gauntlet ever had though.  
* VideoKid - 12/22/19 - Gremlin - This is so weird.  It looks like a fantasy platform game but its a horizontal and vertical shooter.  The shooting isn't satisfying because you cant feel when you hit them. 
* Warzone 1991 Core Design - 12/22/19 - Lots of cool WHDLoad cheats.  I always wanted this game because it was 2 player simultaneous, but there sure are a lot of bullets on screen at once.  I liked it for a few minutes and with the cheats and a buddy I bet this would have been fun if I had bought it bitd.  
* Warzone Paradox - 12/22/19 - THis has to be an 8bit C64 port its not good.  its an autoscroller and you can easily choose the wrong blind path and die because of that, the shootings not good and it doesnt hit correctly. The music isnt bad though. 
* Vigilante - 12/22/19 - the fighting is terrible here. I could punch but it didnt hit anyone so it was just kick and it took like 6 kicks to kill a nearly unresponsive enemy.
* Venom Wing 1990 Thalamus - 12/22/19 - Cool space intro and music! I was excited until I got into the game which is a shooter that is vastly underpowered and doesnt make sense because its scrolling back and forth and up and down but within limits which then shift and you cant touch anything and huge sprite has no were to go.  then it crashed after 60s. 
* Wacky Races - 12/22/19 - Well its a cutie idea of a platform game with a car instead of a person and its not bad until it gets near the end of hte race and you're in 2nd place and therses an impssible gjump.
* Waxworks - 12/22/19 - Accolade.  I think this is a really gory game.  Its 3d like EOB but this one when you die it shows your head severed and a bloody mess.  
* War in Middle Earth - 12/22/19 - I dont remember anything about this game.  Melbourne House.  Far precedes the movies.  Cool pixelated graphics.  whoa the overworld is pretty cool and has the ring wraiths on it.   Its got the whole world of Middle earth in here.  Theres a scrollable map and an overview map.  Its really cool.  It is all a bit slow UI to respond.  
* Valhalla - Before the War - 12/22/19 - I owned this on the Vulcan CD collection but I couldnt ever get far at all.  I heard a rumor that this was programmed in AMOS. I think its cool that it has so much speech.  I like that.  I like the animations very much.  The speech mouth animatino is pretty awesome in the intro animation.  Oh cool there are level codes!  Thats a good sign somewhat.   Also its got a great save load system with exact positions!  Dang tehres also an automap wiht details and your location.  Its really cool.  I can wander around looking at things but I couldn't figure out anythign real to do.
* Valhalla and the lord of infinity - 12/22/19 - its real slow paced.  I think this is the one I've played before mostly.  The Crypt.  Its pretty cool how they did these games, however I dont care for puzzle games like this and its so slow paced that I cant possibly keep track of whats going on, or I'm not motivated enough to anyway.  
* Vroom - 12/22/19 I wanted this ever since I saw it because I love 3d and because the mags said it was arcadey and fun.  The music sound good.  The graphics are cool but I cant move the car.  Oh boy this is fun its one of the best racers on Amiga!  
* Vroom Multiplayer - 12/22/19 - This would have been so much fun to rig up several amigas in a network.  This one has more options than the other did.  I don't really know why or how to get mulitplayer working and I didnt see any options for it.  
* Walker Crunched - 12/22/19 - I wanted to own this so bad.  Its got lots of WHDLoad options.  I remember loving the demo because I was able to make decent progress.  The graphics are so cool!  I guess they were partially digitized or maybe just had a great artist but they look so real.   Hey I beat the first level!! Yay!  Proud!  It does reload your shield when you beat a level.  I wonder what the continue structure is like?  The cool audio makes you feel like you're in a warzone.  I like that theres mouse and keyboard controls.  more games should be like that its a great combo.  Yay I proudly destroyed the missile before it launched and I hadnt lost any lives on the first two levels.  this is great!  I'm at Los Angeles 2019.  Load times weren't bad.   
* Walker Uncrunched - 12/22/19 - Load times were fine on the crunched, but maybe from floppy they would have been bad. Lets see about this one.  the load times are instant here.  Delete skips ahead a level so I can start at LA 2019.  
* Virus - 12/22/19 - I owned this back int eh day this is by the guy who made Elite and the 3d is really really cool.  There was nothing else like this bitd and I liked that there were large worlds with smooth scrolling and the overhead map was pretty cool too.  The controls are just incredibly difficult though in 2019.  I think with different controls and a bigger 3d playfield this could be really cool even now.
* Wayne Gretzky Hockey - 12/23/19 - Whoa! Bethesda!  He looks so cute in the intro picture 1988.  You can coach only.  This is good.  Its easy to pick up and play and its pretty fun. I like that there not a lot of player switching it makes it way more laid back for me.  I like it a lot.  
* Wayne Gretzky Hockey 2 - 12/23/19 - This menu looks very similar.  The game is very similar with just a few different options.  If I was a player of the first I would have been disappointed with the second.
* Who Framed Roger Rabbit - 12/23/19 - The graphics are great!  I don't know this driving part is shitty but the graphics are great for this time.  I suspect this is like the NES game which the fucking nerd liked very much so this should be really good.
* Wizkid - 12/23/19 - This is weird but it at least gives you a tutorial. Hey its interesting.  Its kind of like a breakout but you are the ball.  I like it a little bit right away.  You can grab tiles with a teeth, You can bounce them on your head.  I like that if you finish the blocks on the level you're done even if you didn't get all of the enemies.   Its cool that theres an overworld although I suspect that the continue structure isnt great.  
* WWF European Rampage - 12/23/19 - FEaturing Legion Of Doom and with a bunch of sampled speech including what a rush.  hogan, savage, hart, ultimate warrior, Damn thats a great cast!!!  Its hard to figure out what to do but its decent fun and really cool.  
* WWF Wrestlemania - 12/23/19 - Hogan, Ultimate, Bulldog, I have a feeling this is kind of like the arcade game and its pretty good.  
* Wings - 12/23/19 - Wings by Cinemaware - Great presentation.  The 3d is cool and I love their idea of making the 3d playfield smaller by using the wings of the plane.
* Winter Games 12/23/19 - Is it making me pick 8 players?  The hot dog event isnt that fun.  
* World Games 1986 12/23/19 - Weight lifting didnt make any sense.  
* World Tour Golf 1988 - 12/23/19 - Wow the awesome course hole creation is really coool!  I felt like a pro after just a few minutes.  I felt like I had designed an amazing course.  
* World Class Leaderboard - 12/23/19 - I always wondered about this game maybe because I didn't understand the word leaderboard.  I always thought it was a weird name for a game and didnt understand why it was a golf game.  THe menu works fine but I cant seem to get it playing.  
* Wrath of the Demon - 12/23/19 - Cool intro with an escape and lots of cool scenes. 
* WizNLiz - 12/23/19 - Psygnosis - Crashes using both of my emulators. 
* Wing Commander - 12/23/19 - Lots of WHDLoad cheats including level select.  I always wanted to play this even though it felt like a game which was out of my league so to speak.  I never even considered the Amiga version and always thought of this as a PC game.  I died instantly.  
* Wing Commander CD32 - 12/23/19 -  Well this is the same except the text entry is painful compared to the Amiga version, but this one you have to point with the joystick.  With the other one also there was some kind of campaign editor or something?  I died instantly again. 
* Welltris - 12/23/19 - This is a cool 3d tetris where the blocks fall down the outside of the well they dont fill the well in 3d like in other similar 3d tetris games.  Its pretty cool!  
* Winter Challenge - 12/23/19 - Thunder Mountain - its interesting that this slolom mode when you push right the player goes right even though the player is angled down and to the left.  It makes sense from a 1986/88 perspective but from a 2019 perspective or even 1992 perspective it makes way more sense to drive the player from the players perspective.  Imho.  This has better graphics than winter games imho. 
* Wonderdog - 12/23/19 - Core Design.  Hey theres a password!  Damn this scrolling and control is cool!  I dont know what I'm supposed to do and I'm not intrigued personally but its probably a decent game and hopefully it lets you use a password.
* Wonderboy in Monsterland - 12/23/19 - WTF the title screen has Wonderboy with a sword and a shield looking all cool but naked in a fucking diaper!?!  I never knew this was on this system but I loved the 3rd game on SMS and it was the first game I actually beat on my own.  I was so proud.  I had to use space bar to open the first door.  The graphics are crap they are no more than 8 bit pc level graphics.  probably not as good as SMS.  Alright I beat death and the first round.  The music on level 2 hints of WonderBoy 3.  I beat several more bosses or mini-bosses and am on level 3 or something.  I just beat a mushroom boss.  You know its not bad at all.  I got pretty far, then again I'm decent at wonderboy 3.  It was fun!
* Wizball - 12/23/19 - This looks like Wizkid doesn't it?  No but I played this before.    Its like a bouncy shooter platformer.  
* World Circuit - 12/23/19 - AkA Formula 1 Grand Prix by Microprose and Geoff Crammond.  This is one of the best racing games said all of the magazines.   Its pretty awesome.  Theres something intangible about how great this is.  Its hard to put a finger on what is so special about this game. 
* Wizardry 6 Bane of the Cosmic Forge - 12/23/19 - This sits squarely in the same camp as the Ultima games which means I couldn't possibly have gotten anywhere in these games even though I desperately wanted to live some of the fantasy that I believed they could provide.  I cant even figure out the character creation in this game.  
* Where in Europe is Carmen Sandiego - 12/23/19 - This is really cool graphics.  I was proud to have beat the world game on Sega Master System but that game was completely different.  The login is awesome.  Its a little login robot on a desk in front of a sleeping security guard.  Its got cool art, its got cool history.  You gather clues and figure out who to accuse or something.  I like this!  Its got a really great interface and an Amiga Computer too.  I found a vile henchman!  The Hague, Delft Figurines, its so cool because you have to figure out where they are from.  So cool.  
* Where in USA is Carmen Sandiego - 12/23/19 - The interface isn't as good on this game.  I dont care for this setting as much as the other two.
* Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego - 12/23/19 - I like that its a Commodore or Amiga printer.  Its cool that when you are on the right track you find a henchman.  In the Sega Master System version you had to dodge the bullets with your intense platforming and ducking skills.  Its fun following these clues around.  It looks like I got the guy but I didn't have a warrant.  I seem to remember that I need to put data and clues into a computer to get the warrant.  
* Worms 1MB Chip - 12/23/19 - There's no speech in this version prob because of only 1MB.  This is the Directors Cut too.  Wow its so cool seeing the map get generated.  And the parallax in this game makes it all feel so fluid and alive.  Its fun!  
* Worms 2MB Chip - 12/23/19 - jump, move left right, aim up down, fire (hold to shoot).  Theres really cute sound samples.  "Die!" "First Blood!" 
* Worms The Directors Cut AGA - 12/23/19 - Wow there are tons of cool options.  I like how when you shoot some land theres some background land sprite behind it which looks great.  
* Worms The Directors Cut CD32 2MB - 12/23/19 - I don't know that I can see any differences between this and AGA, well actually though I don't know about that I don't see the background sprite in this version which is a bit strange, and it almost seems like this one is based on the 2MB chip ECS version than the AGA version which would be strange but ... 
* Woody's World - 12/23/19 - I should have bought this shareware bitd because it was advertised in Cybernetix and I loved that game so much.  It said it was a big platformer and I would have thought that meant that I would be able to beat it and I would have bought it assuming so, but lets find out.  I played this once upon a time like 20 years ago and then again like a year ago.  I loved the music in Cybernetix so much but the music here doesnt seem nearly as good or inspired.  There was much more to make to be fair. The platforming controls are great.  Its pretty fun!  I would have liked this as a kid even if I would have had to learn to jump with up and that would have been tricky but I wonder if with this game, if I had really invested in the full shareware release, if I would have gotten better at it.  
* Wolfchild - 12/23/19 - I wanted to own this bitd.  I wish I had bought it.  I played this and I think I beat it on Genesis sometime in the last year.  Its so cool looking but there is a little something missing.  I beat level 1 with several lives left and got down off the ship to a forest area.  It puts you in a bunch of situations where you can't not get hit and its too tricky and hard from the start.  
* Zool CD32 - 12/24/19 - Loading times are fine in this version.  Lets see about the CD32 pad and how the buttons map.  Well they dont map at all.  There are two buttons that shoot and two that do nothing.  up jumps.  They should have fixed that (every CD32 game should have mapped a jump button).  Its always confusing that theres not music and fx at same time.  It runs a little bit fast imho.
* Zeewolf - 12/24/19 - It says you can start mission 1 or choose a password.  I remember this being about a helicopter.  Wow the graphics and controls are great!  I love them. The world is amazing.  I dont really know what to do.  
* Zeewolf 2 - 12/24/19 - Music by Alister Brimble - This looks almost exactly the same with a slightly different UI.  The ammo limits are annoying.  The graphics on the water are a bit better I think.  Its pretty cool.  Its like Desert Strike but its better.  The controls are better and the graphics are way more my style.   this runs a little bit slow imho.  
* Zoom! 1988 Discovery - Dang its the Super Freak bassline sampled at the beginning of the game.
* Xenophobe 12/24/19 - I always wanted to play or try this game even at the video store I remember seeing it on NES.  Ugh it sucks.  Theres platforming and shooting and way too many enemies and terrible controls.  I expected so much more and would have been seriously disappointed if I had rented this back then. 
* X-Out 1 disk - 1990 - 12/24/19 - This looks cool and has loads of WHDLoad info. Wow you design your ship.  thats pretty cool!  You design your ship after every life because theres only one life.  The first boss took forever.  
* X-Out 2 disk - 1990 - 12/24/19 - I didn't see any difference between this and the one disk.
* Xybots - 12/24/19 - This is a cool game in the arcade.  Cutting edge for its time in 3d corridors.  Its impressive that they could mostly reproduce this from the arcade on the Amiga.  Its pretty good and if I had enjoyed the arcade I probably would have somewhat enjoyed this, I beat level 1.  The controls are good, even the rotation.  I like the minimap, and whats cool is that it has 8 credits even after the 4th level. Its easier to make progress than Gauntlet!  
* Z-Out - 12/24/19 - It graphically resembles R-Type but its not good and you cant make progress and its not fun.  
* Yogi's Big Clean Up - 12/24/19 - Loads of WHDLoad Options.  Its terrible.  The controls aren't bad nor good.  They're average but at least not broken.  I dis like the scenarios that it puts you in where you have to execute many perfect jumps in a row and if you don't you have to go way back and then do them all again its not fun.  
* Yogi's Great Escape - 12/24/19 - Some WHDLoad Options.  These controls suck way worse than the big clean up.  The button jumps but its completely wooden. 
* Yogi Bear & Friends in the Greed Monster - 12/24/19 - This is so poor.  Its overhead a bit like Zelda but biggers sprites, the gameplay is totally 8bit even if the graphics are more colorful than typical 8bit.  You run around shoot things can't not get hit by tons of enemies, find a key and enter a door and blah.  I would have been so disappointed if I had bought those for a kid bitd.  
* Yolanda Files - This is absurd and no fun at all. You die instantly and repeatedly and the obstacles aren't entertaining.
* Yolanda Image - exactly the same as the previous one.  
* Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders - Ahh lucasfilm.  I always wanted to beat this.  its one of the games they were playing in the Commodore Users Group so I wanted to play it with them, but I didn't have it.  I dont know if they were playing as a group or if it was just an informal mention by one of them.  The graphics aren't good.  There are lots of commands to use that I think would make me confused.  
* Zool 2 - I beat this earlier this year with save states.  I always wanted this bitd but it was an empty desire because I already had the first game and couldn't get anywhere.  I think I imagined that in this game I might be able to make more real progress, maybe it would be easier or somehow more accessible.  It is better designed tbh, but its still throwing a dozen mechanics at you in the first 30 seconds.  I ended up liking this game when I played it earlier this year, but not because it was a decent difficulty or learning curve or really well designed.  I do like the copper backgrounds in this ECS version.  
* Zool 2 AGA - 12/24/19 I dont see much of a diff.  I think tis more colorful but I can't tell but I think the backgrounds are more colorful.  There is something cool about how the paths through the levels are different based on which character you pick.  
* Zoom - 12/24/19 - It doesn't seem to work.  
* Zyconix - 12/24/19 - Accolade - I like the clear scrolling background.  its a puzzle game in some senses like tetris, but it doesn't make sense.  
* Zool AGA - 12/24/19 - This is just like CD32 version I dont think they changed a thing.
* Zool - 12/24/19 - Theres one good reason that I prefer this to the AGA because of the busy backgrounds in the AGA.  
* Xenon - 12/27/19 - I always wanted to buy this because I heard so much about it.  Not everyone believes it is so great.  I dont like it.  The ships dont take damage right I dont know which to hit and there are too many poorly presented projectiles.  One thing that is cool is it uses spacebar or even the 2nd button on the controller to land and then becomes a different game with a ground tank or something.  Its all very confusing but the graphics are really cool for mid to late 80s.  
* Xenon 2 demo - 12/27/19 - I think I played this demo bitd.  I remember not getting far at all.   Its ok.  I get stuck on plants and stuff. 
* Xenon 2 1 disk - 12/27/19 - I always heard this had amazing music and its good but I didn't know the music but I heard it was a hit song on the radio to some degree.  The graphics and music are good.  I think that bitd I would have hated it and I dont think its really very good.  After reading the reviews I thought it was the best and if I would have bought it I would have been really disappointed because its so unclear an dsomewhat unfair.  Its not that fun either but I woudl have thought that my impressions were off not the magazines.  
* Xenon 2 2 disk - 12/27/19 - Lets see what the difference int he 2 disk version is.  More samples in the intro song maybe???   
* Zany Golf - 12/27/19 - 1988 EA Zany Golf.  I remember loving the look of this and wanting to own this so bad.  I played it a bit at Aarons house I believe but only just a bit, maybe nto even a whole round.  Even before that I thought it was awesome just from the magazines.  Its not running.   
* Xenon 2 CDTV - 12/27/19 - I couldn't get it working.  
* Zaxxon 1MB - 12/27/19 - This is one of those ports by Bigonia who made a bunch of C64 ports.  I had this on C64 and it was decent fun and I made a bit of progress eventually getting past the first and maybe 2nd level.  I couldn't get this working but the 512k worked.
* Zaxxon 512MB - 12/27/19 - This is a good game!  I beat the first level and the space section.  And its pretty goood.  Now then on the second level its got a shitty moment.  its got a tiny passage that you have to judge exactly where it is by shooting and guessing and thats not fun.  Thats a defect in the original game design imho.  Maybe on a way later level but not on level 2.  thats silly.  Its still pretty cool adn I always loved the graphcis on this game.  
* ----- DONE WITH ORIGINAL SET!  Since I started this project I found a short list of other games that are reported to be really good and which looked really good when I investigated.  
* Apocalypse - 12/27/19 - This is a bit like choplifter I think with excellent graphics.  wow yeah these graphics are amazing.  The sprites, the backgrounds, the awesome parallax mountains and the tents and landscapes are so cool.  I dont  know what to do but its amazing.  
* Dogs of War - 12/27/19 - This is 2p like ikari warriors and its cool but theres tons of weapons buying and stuff.  I didnt buy any ammo and so I can't shoot at all haha 
* Roadkill CD32 - 12/27/19 - Is this like Rock and Roll Racing?  Its cool that theres a password system here.  Yeah its pretty cool.  the graphics and controls are great.  
* Roadkill AGA - 12/27/19 - Whoa this is by Vision who did Cybernetix!  its pretty cool that the track boundaries deform when you hit the walls.  
* Seek & Destroy ECS - 12/27/19 - Vision did this too!  Its really good shooter where you are overhaed helicopter.  the shooting was good.  
* Seek & Destroy AGA - 12/27/19 - I did it! I beat the first level.  This is really good.  The AGA isn't much different than ECS.

# C64 Games Thoughts #
I bought Gauntlet and was so excited to get it home and play it I remember riding in the back of the station wagon backwards just looking at the box and dreaming about it.  But then I played it a little but I never really took the time to get good at it. Why not?

I remember buying Test Drive for the C64.  

We had borrowed Guild of Thieves from a woman named Dallas in the local Commodore Users Group.  

We had lots of "Thunder Mountain" games.  A Movie Maker game (I looked recently and I think it was by EA).  

And of course a bunch of games that Chris sent us: Questron, Questron II, Phantasie, Phantasie II, Zork, Enchanter, Zork 2, Zork 3, California Games, Uridium, 

We had a commercial Sega games collection.  A Space Shuttle and maybe a Haleys Comet game back in Texas

Eventually I had a boxed copy of Enchanter and the Lost Treasures of Infocom also.

We had Bards Tale 3 the boxed version in the great box with the big circle wheel of dimensions or spells or whatever.

Oh wow the Neverending Story SID is so amazing.  Also I hear the game is an easy text adventure and I would probably like it very much.  

Questron 2: What i remember best about this game and its predecessor on C64 is that I could actually make progress in these where most other RPGs I couldn't get anywhere.  I remember gambling to make lots of money, and I remember something about thieving stores but then getting in trouble with the guards. 

## Background ##
Chaos Engine is an interesting game because its one that I absolutely knew I would love the first time I saw it in a magazine.  I wanted it so badd but for some reason I never bought it.  I don't really know why.  I suspect it had something to do with me not having much money and therefore having to spend it very carefully combined with thinking I could get more gaming value out of cheaper games (although I still didnt buy it a year later when it was probably on sales) combined with an assumption that someday eventually I would be able to buy, play, beat, and love all of the games I ever wanted so I took it for granted.  That was a weird attitude probably related somehow to my parents hoarding tendencies.  It was the same with some other games like: Speedball 2 (even if I wouldn't probably have liked it I always wanted it!) Lotus 2, Kick Off 2 (at least in this case I had bought Goal!  but I didnt realize that Kick Off 2 was quite a bit more accessible), Turrican 2, Chuck Rock, and others.   I suspect if I had it would have been really hard for me but maybe with a password it would have been ok.  regardless I would have loved owning it and playing it.

# Amiga PD Disk Index #
I loved the Fred Fish disks because thats what Computerwise had on CDRom and they let me bring in floppies and burn them from their CDTV which was kind. I found some of the best stuff on there like Megaball and Llamatron. Eventually when I got access to the internet (via dialup shell account from the local university) Computerwise told me about [ftp.funet.fi](http://ftp.funet.fi/pub/amiga/fish/) where I could go get all of the fish disks. That must have been 1995.  Fortunately that archive is still available ~25yrs later! 

Here is some [WHDLoad demos](http://amigas.ru/amiftp/index.php?dir=AmiFTP/whdload/) and what not

Here is an [index of PD Disks](http://www.amiga-stuff.com/pd/index.html) which includes most of the different kind of PD Disks that were available back then and some of them still are now.

Heres an enormous collection of [Amiga Public Domain games](http://ezael.net/Retrogaming/Commodore/Amiga/Games%20-%20Public%20Domain%20-%20%5BADF%5D/A/)

# Mods #
As I look for early MED Modules I see a few names that I remember:
Amegas
CrystalHammer
TNT2

I remember some amazing music called "Face The Music" I think off a fish disk

I remember some of these early med modules from aminet sorted by date
