#  how to cope with unreasonable negative feedback  #

Looking into [this article](https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-ways-not-to-handle-negative-feedback) 

1. Dont get defensive. Feeling defensive is normal but thats not a good way to respond.
2. Dont react on impulse: If I need time to think about it then take that time.
3. Dont dwell on it: Feeling bad is normal and ok.  If you are going to work through those feelings give yourself that time, but also give yourself a time after which you truly let it go.
	1. If it is worth ANY of your time your time is too important to give it more time than its worth.  There is a limit to its worth.
	2. Your emotional vibration is one of the most valuable things you have.
