Myths: mobs, Lynching, and extrajudicial punishment was to protect womens virtue.  

If you have an apocryphal story in your family that an ancestor helped slaves in a restaurant or business, or that an ancestor was hanged alongside slaves for being a sympathizer, some part of the family was likely a slaveowner because these are common stories to make family feel better.


https://www.naacp.org/history-of-lynchings/ Between 1881 and 1968 there were 4743 recorded lynchings in america 3446 (72.7%) black, 1297 (27.3%) white.   I feel shame about this.  To see where the lynchings happened see this [interactive map]( https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/explore) which makes instantly clear where they happened (the south).  

Theres was really no political link between the lynchings in the west and the lynchings in the south.  Some states didnt lynch at all, Some states lynched only whites, some states lynched mostly whites, none of these were the major lynching states in the south.  The lynchings in many of these states were not racially motivated, many in the west for example were wild west spaghetti western style murderers or cattle theives who got lynched.  

Hidden history: England abolished before we did, and therefore Canada, so then refugee slaves escaped to Canada with a great work ethic and worked hard and had great success and did not strain that country's economy (as we are led to believe today)

# Quotes #
## Running against the devil ##
by Rick Wilson

"Trump cannot be shamed, he cannot be embarrassed, he cannot be controlled, and he cannot resist his impulses" 7h41m remaining

"His enablers and ball washers spend their lives in a state of revisionist panic ranging from "He didnt say that" to "he didnt do that" to "How can I enter the witness protection program""

"Democrats dont need to sell the progressive base on opposition to trump, they dont need to sell the rank and file, they dont need to sell african americans, they dont need to sell most hispanics, they do need to make the case that trump is a mentall and morally unwell man and that he sold a pack of lies to the voters in the fifteen or so swing states that matter in 2020"

"Far from the incorruptible swamp draining billionaire his yahoos imagine, trump is a pay to play small ball narcissist who is vulnerable to emotional and financial bribery." 

"The consequence free corruption of the first term will slide into a second where it will become normalized and mainstream.  Its another short slide from there to an American policitcal system in which corruption self dealing and criminality become the central tendency of government.  ... spoiler alert nations where corruption takes hold arent stable, prosperous, or small d democratic for long."

- Right wing policies
  - Brandon DeLong right wing policies remove our freedoms starting with speech and voting, enable a tyrannical government without fiscal responsibility, destroy our economy, kill Americans, glorify sexual assault and abuse, alienate us from the rest of the world. In that order. Get your head out of the sand

  - I think laws shouldn’t try what’s is right and wrong 
  - But only what we consider a critical violation of someone else’s human rights

  - I'm Nolen's mom and you're Nick's dad and the way that they care for each other make me proud of both of them.
  - I'm the person who not just got along with you since we met a few years ago, but really enjoyed talking with you each time since then.
  - I'm the person that was with my daughter at the U-Haul place where you were also with your son when those two decided to embark on their adventure to Colorado. We both tried our best to not cry, as I recall.
  - I'm a person who cares about your son and embraces him as a part of my family.
  - You asked if I'm a "libtard"- a liberal retard. As for the liberal part, my political affiliation has nothing to do with our roles in each other's lives.  As for the "retard" part, as an educator of special needs kids, it would be disrespectful to them to even address this, so I won't.
  - I'm still all of the things I noted at the beginning of this comment. Politics doesn't have to be a part of our relationship. It can be just about celebrating our kids' lives together. That's gone pretty well up until now.

  - Going to the doctor is just something for accidents otherwise having doctors is so unnecessary it is an embarrassment of the past
- Prediction
  - The banks / oil companies can’t afford to let any information about UFOs get out because it will utterly destroy the oil industry
- clever reply
  - eric is referring to the 25% of Americans on Medicare whose experience is similar to this except they would get to the specialists office and (assuming that the office isn’t run by one of the 20–40% of doctors who don’t accept Medicare) be sent home since they didn’t have an appointment, then either they call around and find a specialist in the next county who has a cancellation (hopefully not during their work hours) or they come back two weeks later at the time of their appointment and would have to fill out a ream of new patient paperwork while they waited and then assuming they don’t report a complicated medical history (in which case it would have to be semi-manually transferred from a variety of other doctors offices requiring signatures and permissions and waiting until they open the next day), they could be seen, only to be told that Medicare doesn’t cover the procedure they require, so yeah it pretty much works just like Australia.
- Republican policies create fear.  
  - Fear of not being able to afford paying rent (low minimum wages).  Fear of not being able to buy decent food (low minimum wages).  Fear of not having clean air or water (rolling back environmental protections).  Fear that our beautiful national lands will be gone soon (rolling back environmental protections).  Fear of natural disasters (climate change denial).  Fear of not being able to pay your child’s medical bills when she is injured (health care capitalism).  Fear of getting shot on the street or in church (Lack of respect for guns).  Fear of my children getting shot at school (Lack of respect for guns).   I prefer freedom.

- Dismissing the concerns of millions of Americans because they call your guy into question is a convenient way to ignore an enormous body of factual information that conflicts with your worldview and youre not the only person I’ve seen doing that recently.  Honestly I don’t blame you.

1981 they identified all of the qualities of an authoritarian 
trump ran in 2000 and attacked his opponents for the things he ran on this time totally inconsistent
""
"Id like to punch him in the face"
"Be angry be very angry"
"Have the families of terrorists killed"
"waterboarding did not go far enough"

Problematic that he would promise presidential pardons if they are convicted of breaking the law?  The law and order party supports the law and order president who specifically promised to overrule the law and then specifically did so to many specific law breakers.   
They place great value on human life (abortion) then regardless of the deaths of hundreds of thousands of americans do not (covid19)
integrity
Labels of crooked hillary were accepted although there wasnt anything that would stand up in court whle the cilnton foundation is upstanding and efficient while it was found that donalds charity was used illegally and was dissolved.  there is no doubt about him being 'crooked donald' but they continually cheered
Made a big deal about clintons emails, but when his kids were denied securityy clearances he granted them anyway.  
He fired comey because 1. he did it before the investigation, 2. he did it after the investigation, 3. he did it regardless of the investigation, 4. he did it for different reasons dont ask
Mullers work was 1. a hoax, 2. it was a gold standard for such an investigation, 3. crazy the work of 18 angry democrats out to destroy him
trump says there was no interference, putin says there was no interference, therefore the cia, fbi, 450 page muller report, and bipartisan committee from republican led senate are all wrong and the republicans and trump who say there was no interference and it was a witch hunt are right.
"First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out— because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me."
