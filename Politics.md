Myths: mobs, Lynching, and extrajudicial punishment was to protect womens virtue.  

If you have an apocryphal story in your family that an ancestor helped slaves in a restaurant or business, or that an ancestor was hanged alongside slaves for being a sympathizer, some part of the family was likely a slaveowner because these are common stories to make family feel better.


https://www.naacp.org/history-of-lynchings/ Between 1881 and 1968 there were 4743 recorded lynchings in america 3446 (72.7%) black, 1297 (27.3%) white.   I feel shame about this.  To see where the lynchings happened see this [interactive map]( https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/explore) which makes instantly clear where they happened (the south).  

Theres was really no political link between the lynchings in the west and the lynchings in the south.  Some states didnt lynch at all, Some states lynched only whites, some states lynched mostly whites, none of these were the major lynching states in the south.  The lynchings in many of these states were not racially motivated, many in the west for example were wild west spaghetti western style murderers or cattle theives who got lynched.  

Hidden history: England abolished before we did, and therefore Canada, so then refugee slaves escaped to Canada with a great work ethic and worked hard and had great success and did not strain that country's economy (as we are led to believe today)

# Quotes #
## Running against the devil ##
by Rick Wilson

"Trump cannot be shamed, he cannot be embarrassed, he cannot be controlled, and he cannot resist his impulses" 7h41m remaining

"His enablers and ball washers spend their lives in a state of revisionist panic ranging from "He didnt say that" to "he didnt do that" to "How can I enter the witness protection program""

"Democrats dont need to sell the progressive base on opposition to trump, they dont need to sell the rank and file, they dont need to sell african americans, they dont need to sell most hispanics, they do need to make the case that trump is a mentall and morally unwell man and that he sold a pack of lies to the voters in the fifteen or so swing states that matter in 2020"

"Far from the incorruptible swamp draining billionaire his yahoos imagine, trump is a pay to play small ball narcissist who is vulnerable to emotional and financial bribery." 

"The consequence free corruption of the first term will slide into a second where it will become normalized and mainstream.  Its another short slide from there to an American policitcal system in which corruption self dealing and criminality become the central tendency of government.  ... spoiler alert nations where corruption takes hold arent stable, prosperous, or small d democratic for long."

  - eric is referring to the 25% of Americans on Medicare whose experience is similar to this except they would get to the specialists office and (assuming that the office isn’t run by one of the 20–40% of doctors who don’t accept Medicare) be sent home since they didn’t have an appointment, then either they call around and find a specialist in the next county who has a cancellation (hopefully not during their work hours) or they come back two weeks later at the time of their appointment and would have to fill out a ream of new patient paperwork while they waited and then assuming they don’t report a complicated medical history (in which case it would have to be semi-manually transferred from a variety of other doctors offices requiring signatures and permissions and waiting until they open the next day), they could be seen, only to be told that Medicare doesn’t cover the procedure they require, so yeah it pretty much works just like Australia.

1981 they identified all of the qualities of an authoritarian 
trump ran in 2000 and attacked his opponents for the things he ran on this time totally inconsistent
""
"Id like to punch him in the face"
"Be angry be very angry"
"Have the families of terrorists killed"
"waterboarding did not go far enough"

Problematic that he would promise presidential pardons if they are convicted of breaking the law?  The law and order party supports the law and order president who specifically promised to overrule the law and then specifically did so to many specific law breakers.   
They place great value on human life (abortion) then regardless of the deaths of hundreds of thousands of americans do not (covid19)
integrity
Labels of crooked hillary were accepted although there wasnt anything that would stand up in court whle the cilnton foundation is upstanding and efficient while it was found that donalds charity was used illegally and was dissolved.  there is no doubt about him being 'crooked donald' but they continually cheered
Made a big deal about clintons emails, but when his kids were denied securityy clearances he granted them anyway.  
He fired comey because 1. he did it before the investigation, 2. he did it after the investigation, 3. he did it regardless of the investigation, 4. he did it for different reasons dont ask
Mullers work was 1. a hoax, 2. it was a gold standard for such an investigation, 3. crazy the work of 18 angry democrats out to destroy him
Trump says there was no interference, putin says there was no interference, therefore the cia, fbi, 450 page muller report, and bipartisan committee from republican led senate are all wrong and the republicans and trump who say there was no interference and it was a witch hunt are right.
"First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out— because I was not a trade unionist.

Someone Pardoned Nixon after he resigned :(

Told on day 1 by obama the number one threat biggest issue is paul manafort
told from the beginning that the biggest threat to national security was white nationalism

Senate (mcconnell) chose to not hold a hearing to approve secretary of homeland security who is critical for the safety during the peaceful transition of power.  so while there is mass unrest from the hog horde and they are planning attacks the republican senate is intentionally impeding the peaceful transition of power.  at 12:01 bidens cabinet takes over and security from teh hog horde becomes his responsibility but theyve blocked him from having presidential security
The discgraced defeated impeached white supremacist in chief donald trump is a living breakthing impeacheable offence.  
scared to death that we will go back to the time before donald trump when hundreds of thousands of people were crossign the border - wisconsin rep Glenn Grothman
he used the biggest megaphone in the world to spread outright lies to discredit the fairest election in american history
if insurrection and attack on the capital is not an impeachable offense I dont know what is.  whatwould have to happen?

the hog horde did not emerge out of a vacuum.  
he purposely seeded the false belief  debased our democracy creating american carnage
he is unrepentant
the RNC convention should be held responsible as well for the attack on the capital due to their consistent strongly worded lies about Joe Biden representing the apocalypse and then upholding the lies about the fairest election the country has ever seen.  
If you want truth why did you support trumps lies about the election?
if you want peace and unity why did your party create consistent fear of apocalypse under Joe Biden?
on the sun belached bones of history are written those pathetic words "too late. we moved too late to save our great nation" - Rep David Scott from GA

any president who obstructs the college or attacks judges or the court system where there is no evidence to supports their contentions undermines the publics trust and confidence in teh judicial process.  - butterfield NC
he took an oath to defend the country againsta ll enemies foreign and domestic, but when he saw this happenning he did nto call the national guard. 
great speech abou thard work of the real grievances in america mr canon from california - ro khanna #gobackto
healing requires accoutability
he said "there are good people on both sides" after a tragedy he did not condemn or denounce.  he called them patriots and said they were special and he loves them but he did not denounce them or condemn them except for when he said to be peaceful and then.   1 week later he broke with his message of anger divisiveness and hatred and delivered a single clear message, with no contrition, and no responsibility taken, and no comment on his clearest messgae that the election was stolen which is the real driving force behind the riots.  6 ddays later he said that everything he did was fine.  The message given not too long after the riot he was hours later saying he didnt believe it.
if we pursue this then from this day forward impeachment will always be a political process
where he goes in history you go in history unless today you make a stand
our oaths are worthless without accoutability - rep from hawaii
when there is an attack on our democracy ... we will respond to that threat and do what what is necessary to strengthen our democracy
how can the chairman lie to the american public about having more than ccircumstantial evidence that the prsident colluded with the russians abou tthe 2016 elections?
the republicans are looking at this as if this was a one time speech 
I rise in support of impeachement and in oppoosition to the gaslighting that is happening in this chamber todays
If we were on the eve of a rep pres and his dem pred said thes ame thing and incited his followers his mob to descened upon the capital we would be joining them not making comparisons.   mr veasy from texas
"If you cankeep it. and the way we keep it is by saying no to actions and words that do not promote the keeping of that republic"
peaceful transition? Tthere has not been a peaceful transition, youre not living in the same country i am
more members of the presidents own party voting to impeach him than clinton or andrew johnson
republicans complained of there not being process, no witnesses, but just last year when its complicated they saw no witnesses and said the process should be streamlined.  also when republicans want things streamlined for their own purposes they will do so regardless of all proces including the claims of their own lips mcconnell and graham from 2016 about the supreme court. 
* until theres a full acknowledgement taht the election wasnt stole we shoudl remain concerned about violence from the right
z its not just about violence generally but an attack on american democracy.  
z it was rushed because the people deciding were rushed by a mob. these people were there.    the real division in this country was stoked by the president. 
z we have to get out of the process of making political decisions and follow through on the oaths that we made
z where was the outrage over looting and rioting over racial justice?  that is a false equivalency. there is a big difference between burning a part of a city vs attacking the part of the government that represents the voice of the people while flying the flag of traitors upsetting and taking back a legitimately fair election.  Racial justice due to george floyd and decades and centuries of facts and oppression with desperately ineffective results vs a month of the republican party and president and right wing media spreading a consistent lie with no evidence and rallying the hogs around that lie and then those hogs attacking the capital as a result
z "Theres never been a greater betrayal of his office and oath to constitution" - liz cheney
z america does not negotiate with terrorists (white supremacists) 
z not all republicans are white supremacists ... but all white supremacists are republican.

z hes handing out awards to some country singers while he was being impeached
z rigged pushes the bar, apocalypse pushes the bar, destroying our country pushes the bar, a thousand other words by him push the bar toward anger, fear, desperation, that the election was stolen and is handed to someone who is going to destroy america, stand back and stand by pushes the bar, peaceful pulls the bar back, the words sent out during the impeachement pulls the bar back.  when you as a leader do not show decisiveness no one can know what you mean or believve. . are we meant to follow his latest indications?  Are we meant to hear and take to heart his most passionate and most oft repeated statements and indications?    
he made a statement on jan 13 during his impeachment condemning violence and it was good.  Had he made it in 2015 and maintained that message throughout then we would know where we stand.  
he is calling for listening to each other and rising above the rancor.  he himself tried to censor members of congress from certifying the electoral college votes and then call his removal from twitter as a freedom of speech violation.
he has used twitter as the most powerful bullhorn in the world for his message of hatred division and authoritarianism and tried to create division and undermine the election, Republicans have used their platform to amplify the same message and therefore create the same division and undermine the same election

giuliani told them we are oging to have "trial by combat" at the same rally.   when trump says nothing to counter that message at his own rally then that remains the final word of authority from the rally.
200 people identified who were in the capital.  filed charges on 30.  why did they not round them all up instantly/
donald trump 
republican lawmakers are terrified not only from trump but from trumps base (the hog horde)
caesar sayez sent bombs
this is not the one isolated incident in which he has incited violence.  
if you share factual information and it makes people so made that they riot have you incited a riot?  are you responsible in any way for the riot?  if you lie and it makes people so mad they riot have you incited a riot? are you responisble in any way for the riot? 
he has amplified the violent message.  

Republicans1yr ago: "Naah no witnesses the senate trial.  Regardless of the severity of the issue, and the 450pages of documentation we dont need due process.   streamlined.  Done.  NOT GUILTY!"
1yr ago in the senate: "Due process? naaaah we dont need witnesses.  Aquitted!  Streamlined!  Perfect!"

This looks legitimate so I want to know more: Another article says she was 'vote harvesting', was she changing votes?  Did it get close to affecting the outcome in some county?  How did it affect the outcome? How widespread was it?  how many votes did it affect?  Ken Paxton (currently indicted for fraud) and project veritas being involved puts a stink on the credibility so we need to know more.  Did this go any distance toward correcting other parties election interference?  Did we ever find out how many ballots were illegally collected by the church in Austin?  is this related?  Does it make someone feel better about this election in some way?  Did someone say there was zero election fraud?  I've never heard that.  

Trump will always promise his support, demand his loyalty, and then not pay you with his support or his money (see giuliani)

How to know what party to vote for?  no matter what you think is the right policy or the right party: is the party's policies making the average americans lives better or not?  See the democrats vs republicans in december 2020 stimulus checks



Make weird the new normal -the black friend


Precedent for impeachement?  You mean the precedent you set in the 90s when you impeached Clinton for lying about sexual misconduct (which has no effect on the american people) while ignoring the thousands of lies by president trump which had enormous specific consequences for the american people.  Did you put trump under oath?  He would have lied 
Newt attacked Clinton because of his deeply held religious beliefs while divorcing his two wives when they got into hospitals.

when 4 yrs of inveestigation was complete and they had a rock sollid case against thte KKK for the birmingham bombings  hoover said sttop the investigation, doccuments to be sealed and withheld from prosecutors.  4 children died and This means further violence and terrorism happened because they went free

If evangelicals can ignore lot giving up his daughters to rape in sodom story and his wife is the only one who gets punished and he is considered righteous, 
and if god punishes the wife for looking but not the man for giving up his daughters to rape, 
if they can overlook foreskins and genocide and rape and child sacrifice this then it is dangerous because they are capable in fact trained to overlook those things and trust the bible and their interpretation god 100% without reconciling those things with what they claim god is saying
and then it makes sense that they can overlook all the things trump did just like they overlook what god did

if they are ok with god doing these vengeful rageful petty face saving things then why wouldnt they support trump?
then it makes sense that if you picture

athiests resolve cognitive dissonance with science and logic
non evangelical protestants resolve cogntive dissonance by saying 'yeah some of this is wrong' or 'whoever wrote that got it wrong' or some other explanation
evangelicals when confronted with cognitive dissonance dont resolve it and thats the danger.  they can wholeheartedly move forward without resolving cognitive dissonance.  They can dismiss any cognitive dissonance.  Thats dangerous.  they still believe those things are literal and exact and correct.    "Who am I to doubt god I still believe the bible is the word of God" or "Who am I to judge what Trump has done" same story. 

So lots of religions are fucked up for shame reasons and distortion reasons, but evangelicals are fucked up because of the way they think.
