## X Files ##
* 1x2 Super Young Seth Green!  
* 3x12 "I dont know if you know anything about UFOs but ..." stranger speaking to Mulder haha
* 3x13 this is getting funnier and more lighthearted.  Mulder is flirty in this episode and the previous.  "So what are you doing at my house?"  "I was hoping you could help me solve the mystery of the horny beast"  and later "Someone in here is wearing my favorite perfume" *sniffs scully* "must be detective white"  haha
* 3x15 Scully "Its a north american P51 Mustang" Mulder "I just got very turned on"
* 3x20 Jessie Ventura is in this episode!  Hes a spooky character and looks totally different than he does now.  later "One of them was disguised as a woman." (speaking of Scully)
* 3x24 "Men can never be free because they are weak corrupt worthless and restless"
* 3xlast episode WOW Cliffhanger!
* 4x1 Bees!  So many bees!
* 4x2 This is full of foul and disgusting things
* 4x7 Awesome Background history episode with JFK and MLK,  And at the end theres a life is like a box of chocolates monologue by cancer man which is depressing yet funny.  Also whats funny is this was about the year forrest gump came out.  Its quiet desperation.  The guy was really cute when he got his work published so excited and happy for once.  
* 4x13 Its so 90s.  She is at this guys house and on his thick laptop she dials a modem and it connects (10 times faster than possible) and then its a small window in the middle thats called like cytron net or something its pre-netscape days.  I think this was 1996.  Also a few minutes later he does a redial and I was thinking of *69
* 4x18 "I think you were actually kindred spirits in some deep strange way" " What do you mean?" " Men with spartan lives simple in their creature comforts if only to allow for the complexity of their passions"
* 4xfinal huge cliffhanger for final episode of season.  dirty trick.  That would have made me so mad!
* 5x7 GREAT Twist at the end!  cant wait to see pt 2
* 5x11 "It would need bandwidth.  Itd need a T3 at least.  a hardline 45megs a second".  Thats so funny because I remember wanting a T1 bitd so bad.  I considered paying like $1000/mo plus install.  later "But the government keeps those records secret for fear of sabotage."  "Gee you guys know anyone who works for the government?" haha
* 5x12 luke wilson is hilarious here.  Theres some great tension! ITs relaly funny how in her recollection everything is dramatized more and funnier :) "Shut yo mouth Im talking about shaft"  and then Mulder tells the same story with hilarious funny twists of attitude and tone.  In Mulders story Luke Wilson was really ugly haha!  "Finally you left" (about scully finally leaving)
* 5x20 - This is a great episode.  I loved it. I love the kid who can read minds as a chess player.  And i love the consequences of them making reasonable choices.
* The Movie 1998!  This is good I saw it bitd and I liked it and enjoyed the adventureof it but I had never watched more than 1 episode and that one I didnt understand a bit.  I thought I would understand more but really I cant imagine that any of this would be clear without having watched teh show.  I remember not really gettin git but thinking it was pretty cool.  Now I'm really excited because I've got all of the backgorund.  Funny thing: He gets in a cab and says "arlington.  No better make that Georgetown"  Thats 3 hours away!?!?!?!  Its getting emotional and heartwarming at 1:13 and I remember this part getting emotional and I remember people talking about them kisisng or at least hte ads suggesting that they might. I remember the ice falling at the end and that being a real scary scene.  I mostly understood the whole action rescue sequence here.  Its cute that scully doesnt get to see it flying away so she'll never quite believe it. 
* 6x3 this one is exciting.  hhaahaha she kisses skinner on the mouth when he gets her the information!  haha he kissed scullys doppelganger :)
* 6x4 David St Hubbins!!!  HAHA THe mirror scene is so great!!!!!  Mulders Mirror Dance
* 6x8 ghosts stole christmas "Wait-- is that a hound I hear baying out on the moors? No. Actually that was a left cheek sneak."
* 6x9 "I was boxing, must have gotten tagged"  "at least you didnt get youre ear bit off"  timely joke haha
* 6x15 this is great.  Mulder is suggesting that Scully is into new age stuff.  And it was so funny when at 25:00 he put out a flamingo as a sure fire way of pissing off the neighbors and then pumped his fists and sid bring it on. haha
* 6x17 guys face is blown off and mulder accidentally touches it "Ugh.  Gesundheit" haha!
* 6xlast Once again it ended up on a cliffhanger with one of them in danger or dead.
* 7x2 This happy life that hes in is way too good to be true (thats what I was writing here right when I found out I was right)
* 7x3 Derwood Spinks is young SATAN on Supernatural
* 7x4 This one is right before the turn of the century which is a cool time capsule!  HOLY SHIT ACTUAL TENDER KISS!  At the end!!!  
* 7x5 This guy is goofy in such a good way.  Wasn't he in supernatural or some other show?  Yeah he was writing tv shows about them! Wasnt he a lucky guy in that show too?  I love the possible lesson here that what looks like bad luck might be good luck but we're not in the position to see that yet because we cant see the forest for the trees.  That is one of my favorite episodes ever.  Shes using a cool high tech apple Powerbook!  
* 7x7 This one was so interesting that when I foudn out it was a followup I went back and watched the original 2x7 Great quote: "God is a spectator scully he just reads the box scores"
* 7x8 I feel like I've seen this specific episode before.  He turns his head around as a prank and it falls off.
* 7x9 subtle joke that fell nearly unnoticed: "Snake Handling, didnt learn that in catechism class" "thats funny I knew a couple catholic schoolgirls who were experts at it."  I like the contrast ata bout 15:00 between the crazy fundamentalist message and the more mainstream message on the same scripture passage.
* 7x10 creepy at the end.  The next episode is called closure I wonder if he finally finds out what happened to his sister?
* 7x16 So wait ... did smoking man just literally do all that and then throw away the solution to all human disease into a lake?  did he cure himeself first?  holy shit.
* 7x17 "i didnt say God spoke back I said I had a vision" "coming from you that's like saying you had David Crosby's baby"
* 7x19 Garry Shandling: "Do you dress to the left or to the right" loosk down uncomfortably "look when I play a character I need to find his center his sort of rudder so to say and everything come sfrom that" "I guses mostly to the left?" "mostly?" "most of the time to the left"  "Wardrobe!"  later when all 3 are in bubble baths but theyve lied mulder:"hang on jsut a second sir" presses hold "Hey scully skinman is calling me from a bubblebath" "its still me mulder" hahaha  later: "Yeah like Tea Leoni is ever going to have a crush on me!?!" they were married at the time!  later: "its just that I'm in love with assistant director walter skinner"  "What does he have that I dont have"  " a bigger flashlight "
* 7x20 its funny when Mulder gets sucked down into a sewere hole.  Also  He just got done saying "No shit sherlock" but it staticed out the word shit.
* 7x21 haha the genie suggests non verbally that the brother cure his brothers paralysis, but they cant figure out what shes trying to suggest "I got one, granted its really obvious" ...  haha
* 8x2 This is one of my favorite episodes ever.  They are so close to mulder in the desert!  I really really like robert patrick in this.  I didnt want to like him at all at first and his T2 apperaeance still make sme uncomfortable in a creepy way.  but he is a really cool guy and theres nobody who could take that role at all.  I think hes really compassionate and nice deep down.  it pisses me right off that the deputy director is such a dick about aliens and how hes going to ruin anyone who reports the facts about them.  Its going to be really cool to see how two unbelievers work together on crazy files like this.  Is she goign to run roughshod over all of the evidence.  
* 8x21 Ended without a cliffhanger for once!  Doggett is great throughout this season. Hes an excellent addition to the team.  
* 9x1 Whoa this aired 11/11/2001 just a few months after 9/11
* 10x3 the description of how he changed at like 26:00 in the cemetery is so damn funny! And then how he skips off at the end.  Awesome!  Everything with him is funny.  I think I know his voice from somewhere


## Star Trek Voyager ##
Some of my favorite episodes:
* S6:E6 Riddles.  I liked this one because of how fun the interactions were when Tuvok was childlike and I just liked how childlike he was.  He acted this really well imho.  It tugged at my heartstrings
* 5x07 Infinite Regress.  In this one Seven has many personalities which make her character super fun!
* 5x22 Someone to Watch Over Me.  This tugged at the heartstrings and you got to see the doctor in one of his best roles.
* 6x4 Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy.  You get to see the doctor in all of his dramatic glory
* 6x13 Virtuoso: Not only is there cool singing and the doctors ego makes a starring role, Seven brings a tear to your eye at the end.
* 6x15 an inspirational quote at the end about acceptance of being human:  “You are experiencing difficult emotions?”  “Guilt, Shame, remorse.” “Then you have not lost your humanity, you have reaffirmed it.”
* 7x7 "its been a busy day I guess I'm perspiring a little." The doctor takes over Sevens body so Jeri Ryan has to act like the doctor which is just fantastic!  "the tastes, the textures, feeling it slide down Sevens esophagus, its exquisite!" "They're prison rations, my uniform would taste better." The cheesecake response is epic.   "What other foods can that device create?"  HAHA!  "Ruggedly handson, a sharp wit, a towering intellect."   Also its got cool moral undertones about holograms.  Of course there are many other episodes with cool moral undertones about holograms.  There are also homoerotic undertones which make it even more interesting.
* 7x13 Prophecy This one is about religion and sacred texts and how to interpret them to mean whatever you want to manipulate a people.  And it shows how other people interpret it and make rash decisions. Also Harry gets some hot Klingon attention and Neelix steals his woman.  
* 7x20 Friendship One  The difference they made to these people even though they were so small minded to let them help choked me up a bit.
* 7x22 Homestead    Its hearwarming to see Neelix meet some of his people and to see the crew of Voyager treat him with so much love and respect.  *Cockles!*
* 1x1 Caretaker   So sad.  I would have preferred they take the array home. I feel like the ocampa should have been left alone even if they were somewhat already involved.  Still then we would have missed out on all of this.
* 1x6 Eye of the Needle  First episode which explicitly calls out the prejudices against holograms (doctor).  In the previous episode there was some overtones of this but in this episode they call it out explicitly.  Further it was a really cool episode. I love the time travel idea.  I don't understand why when they found out that the guy eventually died, they didn't contact him again on his ship in the 'present' and ask him to schedule the transmission for 20 years in the future or have some backup plan 'just in case something happens'.  The funny thing is when they handed him the messages they handed him a crystal that was about the size of a USB thumb drive.  I thought this was cool since those weren't on the market for another 4 years at the earliest (and even then they were tiny although that would have been enough to send some text messages).  I also had a thought that if he just kept the thumb drive crystal in a safe place and then 20 years later an alarm went off saying "send the messages that voyager gave you" he would pick up the thumb drive crystal and try to stick it in his computer but technology would have advanced so far that the thumb drive wouldn't even work at all!?!  these days that kind of stuff is possible :)
* 1x7 Neelix: A what?  What did he say?  a mind what??? 13:44 remaining HAHA!
* 1x8 The doctor joins Beowulf!  Lord Schweizer!  The Doctors first kiss! "Fire is not the only heat Lord Schweizer.  You know where I sleep."
* 2x1 It was so cute how they responded to the old car.  espcially when paris turned it on!  Warp 9.9 is 4 billion miles/second.  The empty bay is a touching moment.  
* 2x13 Prototype: I really liked how innocent the robots seemed.  The costumes weren't great tbh.  It has a great morality since its about several things: AI uprising, but more importantly generational violence.
* 2x15 Threshold: I would be pissed if I was Tom Paris too.  I would want to go down in history as the first!
* 2x19 Lifesigns: So cute how the doctor told that girl he was romantically attracted to her at around 15:30.   Also "Mr Paris, I assume youve had a great deal of experience being rejected by women."  HAHA!  Previous episodes have hints of his developing ego and unique arrogant personality but I believe he truly turns to developing a strong personality in this episode in the next episode his hilarious ego comes through near full strength.
* 2x25 Resolutions - so Bittersweet
* 3x8 I loved this 1990s episode!  So much culture and locations or settings that I recognized and Sarah Silverman!  and it was a cool movie length plot too and epic scale.  It was great and there were some funny references too in what they showed and in the references Tom Paris made.
* 3x10 Warlord.  Kess' acting is AMAZING!  Her voice is always great but in this shes fantastic.
* 3x11 The Q and the Gray: She should have negotiated!  She could have prostituted herself in a way to get them all back to the alpha quadrant!!!
* 3x21 The doctor gets a family and its a fun and somewhat realistic dramatization of family dynamics and the problems of raising a teen.
* 3x23  Distant Origin: This is an excellent example of how powerful beliefs stop progress.
* 3x24 with 39:24 remaining when belanna was talking to harry her description of hostility was really funny!
* 4x1 Seven!!!
* 4x3 They're in love!!!
* 4x4 Nemesis: Final Line " I wish it was as easy to stop hating as it is to start"
* 4x5 Harry blows it when Seven tries to get him naked.  She wanted to explore!  Let her!!!
* 4x10 I love the idea of people being responsible for not only their actions but also their thoughts

## Legends of Tomorrow ##
* 3x2 Freakshow - Martin: "The titanic?  No I will never set a foot on that thing!"
* 3x3 Zari - Rory: "Ahh a prison break!" 
* 3x4 Phone Home - Awesome! He talks about the NES controller and zelda and tecmo bowl!  Nate makes out with Rays mom!
* 3x5 Return of the Mack - is really cool because of the song at the beginning and the coreographed resurrection scene, plus Zari is playing Mortal Kombat at the end
* 3x6 Helen Hunt - Firestorm switch! Its so funny seeing the jax (a black kid) acting like the old white professor!  They even reacted perfectly to being told to stay on the ship! I love where they drop Helen off at the end.  What a great reference!
* 3x7 Welcome to the Jungle.  It think its cool that we get to meet Micks dad.  They even spit at the same time.
* 3x11 Here I Go Again.  Time loop!  This is where we first meet Rebecca Silver.  "Did you do the uh" "fun montage?" "yeah!" "Yeah thanks for that you're a good friend", haha!  "Did you have a meaningful message for me?"  "NOT NOW GARY!!!", "It doesn't take a supercomputer to predict that those two would end up dinky tickling once amara returned to the team"  Lots of good plot improvements in this one: Mick, Sarah, Amaya and Nate, etc.  This is one of the best!
* 3x12 First Date!  Careless Whisper karaoke haha!    Lots of exciting scenes in this pirate drama!  Hey you guys!!!! haha!
* 3x14 Elvis in church!
* 3x15 "*defensively* Are you guys from the apartment co-op?  because its perfectly legal to win an apartment in a duel!"
* 3x1  SO FUNNY when Nate and Mick heal each others hearts accidentally because they are on unicorn drugs!
* 3x17 Rory is watching Lord of the Rings!  Its Denethor!!!  "... after we saved Barack Obama!  Oh and I met John Noble!"
* 3x18 "They beat him with the care bear stare!"  "Like Voltron!" "Are we making a baby?"  "You telling us to focus is making it hard to focus."  Their voltron form is so epic!!!

## Dead Zone ##
Up to 6x2 as of 12/18/19
* 6x1 - Damn it!  Thats so sad!  About to have a baby too.  :( 
* 6x3 "I bet being Vice President is as hard as it looks" - Sarah "Well you don't get to pick your battles but you still have to win them." - Vice President Stillson on Dead Zone 6x3 17:00
* 6x8 This ended up being one of the coolest episodes.  Self contained and heartwarming and interesting and clever.  Great writing and heart.
* 6x9 Its kind of funny how his step dad Reverend Purdy just disappeared.  he said he would but they didnt explain it any further than that haha :).  Wait ... why did she make that decision at the end?  thats rash imho
* 6x13 Ahh this might help wrap up Reverend Purdys questions. 
* 5x4 It’s just the idea that a young man like josh Blake could be moved to hate and fear his own nature because of his faith
Preacher on dead zone 5x4 37:00 


## MST3K ##
* 1205  They are on FIRE starting from the third joke! Farts popcorn yahtzee - THis is one of my favorites!
* 1206  Stop tickling me mr websalot.  Come on feel the noize..  "What better for a group of blind laborers than a gaping pit in the middle of the floor"
* Lords of the Deep 50:19 The most realistic sex scene ever.  I could convince you but I’d like to do it tomorrow. 
* Atlantic Rim - And the movie ends as it begins, as a garbage fire

# Wrestling #
* All star wrestling dec 31 1977
- Ken patera bear hugged someone to submission!
- Captain Lou Albano was with ken
- I just watched some 1977 WWWF where after a Bob Backlund match Freddie bassi talked about how rich mr Fuji’s and Professor Tanakas families are back in “the orient” where IBM is a drop in the ocean compared to how rich their families are hahaha 
- There’s only a little piece of canvas outside the ring.  It must hurt out thwre
- Vicky Williams could have gotten back in the ring but attacked instead and got counted out :( moola won :(
- Vince just was talking about possibly disqualifying for what they called “aggressive tactics“
- Now he’s interviewing and actually calling out the use of a foreign object and the manager is having to explain himself so the grand wizard says he hypnotized the whole audience into believing that he handed Lou graham a foreign object haha
- Sep 2 1978
- Wow they counted fast back then at 30:00 there was a series of near falls and the counts were 123 really fast
- Then the wrestler picked up the ref and the ref kicked at the opponent to defend them both from the hot opponent
- Top rope leaps were much sloppier the ropes were much softer and bouncier so there wasn’t really a way to do those mighty leaps
- Peter maivia and bob backlund!
- Jan 28 1978 and it’s a two on one match!

* 1989 wcw bash
- Gordon sully is no mean gene
- Steamboat carried a live dragon out to the ring!
- The tux match made me very happy
- Irwin schyster is so unlikeable (mike rotunda)
- Steamboat v luger
  - Bringing a chair and preparing to hit your opponebt ok
  - Tossing the ref around ok
  - Knocking the ref down ok
  - Hitting opponent on back with chair DQ
- At 1:38 the Freebirds promo has Samoan swat team Eating each other in the front haha
- At 2:23 Flairs piledrivers are weak and seem sloppy and like they could cause injury

* 1992 Royal Rumble 4-22-2020 I've watched this before when Cristi said she liked Kerri von Erich so we looked him up and found this rumble.  I loved the cheesy solo promos before the rumble especially by repo man but all of them were great.  I realized that the Legion of Doom entrance is the same as the chorus to Def Leppards Women song (Proud of that realization).  Heenan says some really funny stuff.  Its cute that Monsoon keeps telling Heenan that "No one in the history of the royal rumble has ever drawn numbers one through five and been there at the end" its cute because this is only the 5th one ever haha.  Theres hardly any history to draw upon :)  Greg the hammer put the Flair Figure 4 on Ric Flair!!!  Its cool because this is a perfect example of people I knew from back in the day.  I knew almost everyone in this show.  I loved the bushwhackers today they are so much fun and I love their arm motion.  Whoa repo actually eliminated someone.  You know whats kind of weird is these guys had a huge influence on me in my childhood and I knew many of their names and faces and looks, but I dont remember watching much of this.  I dont remember watching any on a regular basis for sure.  I just remember occasionlaly stumbling upon it in the morning or the evening of a weekend or something.  I suspect I knew them from commercials during transformers or something.  Maybe ads for the thumb wrestlers or the dolls or something.  OMG Macho jumped over the ropes to keep attacking the snake! Mustafa was one of Hussein's generals?  Haha thats awesome!  After the rumble Mean Gene has to interrupt the interview to tell someone "Put that cigarette out!" haha
* Funny: Somehow I found [this classic sell of a ref getting hit and bouncing down the ropes brilliantly](https://www.barstoolsports.com/blog/1425344/this-referees-sell-of-a-rowdy-roddy-piper-punch-is-my-favorite-thing-ive-ever-seen) lol 

# Quotes from TV & Movies #
* Travelers
	Travelers s2x2 on a pier the doctor from the future uses tapping to try to treat ptsd, later she uses eye movement therapy and uses it with tapping
	Travelers 2x9 said “historians, when you run out call this number to ask for more” and flashed the number on the screen for a fraction of a second and all of them instantly read it and memorized it. Haha so cool
	It’s also cute how these matrix style updates seem to have any meaning since once he blinked and the characters are changing as fast  as a blink so he absolutely misses something in that blink.  Well ok to give them the benefit maybe it’s encoded with some kind of error correction

    * Predator  The Nerd: (sarcastically) Wow, they sure followed the movie pretty closely. You know the plot: A special forces team led by Alan "Dutch" Schaefer dressed in hot pink go on a mission to rescue hostages in Central America. They are hunted by piranha balloons, plants that spit fireballs, Lolos or Shy Guys, chickens with skull masks, giant bacteria, Metroids, and birds that crap blood.
