# TV #

## X Files ##
* 1x2 Super Young Seth Green!  

## Star Trek Voyager ##
Some of my favorite episodes:
* S6:E6 Riddles.  I liked this one because of how fun the interactions were when Tuvok was childlike and I just liked how childlike he was.  He acted this really well imho.  It tugged at my heartstrings
* 5x07 Infinite Regress.  In this one Seven has many personalities which make her character super fun!
* 5x22 Someone to Watch Over Me.  This tugged at the heartstrings and you got to see the doctor in one of his best roles.
* 6x4 Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy.  You get to see the doctor in all of his dramatic glory
* 6x13 Virtuoso: Not only is there cool singing and the doctors ego makes a starring role, Seven brings a tear to your eye at the end.
* 6x15 an inspirational quote at the end about acceptance of being human:  “You are experiencing difficult emotions?”  “Guilt, Shame, remorse.” “Then you have not lost your humanity, you have reaffirmed it.”
* 7x7 "its been a busy day I guess I'm perspiring a little." The doctor takes over Sevens body so Jeri Ryan has to act like the doctor which is just fantastic!  "the tastes, the textures, feeling it slide down Sevens esophagus, its exquisite!" "They're prison rations, my uniform would taste better." The cheesecake response is epic.   "What other foods can that device create?"  HAHA!  "Ruggedly handson, a sharp wit, a towering intellect."   Also its got cool moral undertones about holograms.  Of course there are many other episodes with cool moral undertones about holograms.  There are also homoerotic undertones which make it even more interesting.
* 7x13 Prophecy This one is about religion and sacred texts and how to interpret them to mean whatever you want to manipulate a people.  And it shows how other people interpret it and make rash decisions. Also Harry gets some hot Klingon attention and Neelix steals his woman.  
* 7x20 Friendship One  The difference they made to these people even though they were so small minded to let them help choked me up a bit.
* 7x22 Homestead    Its hearwarming to see Neelix meet some of his people and to see the crew of Voyager treat him with so much love and respect.  *Cockles!*
* 1x1 Caretaker   So sad.  I would have preferred they take the array home. I feel like the ocampa should have been left alone even if they were somewhat already involved.  Still then we would have missed out on all of this.
* 1x6 Eye of the Needle  First episode which explicitly calls out the prejudices against holograms (doctor).  In the previous episode there was some overtones of this but in this episode they call it out explicitly.  Further it was a really cool episode. I love the time travel idea.  I don't understand why when they found out that the guy eventually died, they didn't contact him again on his ship in the 'present' and ask him to schedule the transmission for 20 years in the future or have some backup plan 'just in case something happens'.  The funny thing is when they handed him the messages they handed him a crystal that was about the size of a USB thumb drive.  I thought this was cool since those weren't on the market for another 4 years at the earliest (and even then they were tiny although that would have been enough to send some text messages).  I also had a thought that if he just kept the thumb drive crystal in a safe place and then 20 years later an alarm went off saying "send the messages that voyager gave you" he would pick up the thumb drive crystal and try to stick it in his computer but technology would have advanced so far that the thumb drive wouldn't even work at all!?!  these days that kind of stuff is possible :)
* 1x7 Neelix: A what?  What did he say?  a mind what??? 13:44 remaining HAHA!
* 1x8 The doctor joins Beowulf!  Lord Schweizer!  The Doctors first kiss! "Fire is not the only heat Lord Schweizer.  You know where I sleep."
* 2x1 It was so cute how they responded to the old car.  espcially when paris turned it on!  Warp 9.9 is 4 billion miles/second.  The empty bay is a touching moment.  
* 2x13 Prototype: I really liked how innocent the robots seemed.  The costumes weren't great tbh.  It has a great morality since its about several things: AI uprising, but more importantly generational violence.
* 2x15 Threshold: I would be pissed if I was Tom Paris too.  I would want to go down in history as the first!
* 2x19 Lifesigns: So cute how the doctor told that girl he was romantically attracted to her at around 15:30.   Also "Mr Paris, I assume youve had a great deal of experience being rejected by women."  HAHA!  Previous episodes have hints of his developing ego and unique arrogant personality but I believe he truly turns to developing a strong personality in this episode in the next episode his hilarious ego comes through near full strength.
* 2x25 Resolutions - so Bittersweet
* 3x8 I loved this 1990s episode!  So much culture and locations or settings that I recognized and Sarah Silverman!  and it was a cool movie length plot too and epic scale.  It was great and there were some funny references too in what they showed and in the references Tom Paris made.
* 3x10 Warlord.  Kess' acting is AMAZING!  Her voice is always great but in this shes fantastic.
* 3x11 The Q and the Gray: She should have negotiated!  She could have prostituted herself in a way to get them all back to the alpha quadrant!!!
* 3x21 The doctor gets a family and its a fun and somewhat realistic dramatization of family dynamics and the problems of raising a teen.
* 3x23  Distant Origin: This is an excellent example of how powerful beliefs stop progress.
* 3x24 with 39:24 remaining when belanna was talking to harry her description of hostility was really funny!
* 4x1 Seven!!!
* 4x3 They're in love!!!
* 4x4 Nemesis: Final Line " I wish it was as easy to stop hating as it is to start"
* 4x5 Harry blows it when Seven tries to get him naked.  She wanted to explore!  Let her!!!
* 4x10 I love the idea of people being responsible for not only their actions but also their thoughts

## Legends of Tomorrow ##
* 3x2 Freakshow - Martin: "The titanic?  No I will never set a foot on that thing!"
* 3x3 Zari - Rory: "Ahh a prison break!" 
* 3x4 Phone Home - Awesome! He talks about the NES controller and zelda and tecmo bowl!  Nate makes out with Rays mom!
* 3x5 Return of the Mack - is really cool because of the song at the beginning and the coreographed resurrection scene, plus Zari is playing Mortal Kombat at the end
* 3x6 Helen Hunt - Firestorm switch! Its so funny seeing the jax (a black kid) acting like the old white professor!  They even reacted perfectly to being told to stay on the ship! I love where they drop Helen off at the end.  What a great reference!
* 3x7 Welcome to the Jungle.  It think its cool that we get to meet Micks dad.  They even spit at the same time.
* 3x11 Here I Go Again.  Time loop!  This is where we first meet Rebecca Silver.  "Did you do the uh" "fun montage?" "yeah!" "Yeah thanks for that you're a good friend", haha!  "Did you have a meaningful message for me?"  "NOT NOW GARY!!!", "It doesn't take a supercomputer to predict that those two would end up dinky tickling once amara returned to the team"  Lots of good plot improvements in this one: Mick, Sarah, Amaya and Nate, etc.  This is one of the best!
* 3x12 First Date!  Careless Whisper karaoke haha!    Lots of exciting scenes in this pirate drama!  Hey you guys!!!! haha!
* 3x14 Elvis in church!
* 3x15 "*defensively* Are you guys from the apartment co-op?  because its perfectly legal to win an apartment in a duel!"
* 3x1  SO FUNNY when Nate and Mick heal each others hearts accidentally because they are on unicorn drugs!
* 3x17 Rory is watching Lord of the Rings!  Its Denethor!!!  "... after we saved Barack Obama!  Oh and I met John Noble!"
* 3x18 "They beat him with the care bear stare!"  "Like Voltron!" "Are we making a baby?"  "You telling us to focus is making it hard to focus."  Their voltron form is so epic!!!

* 6x9 Its kind of funny how his step dad Reverend Purdy just disappeared.  he said he would but they didnt explain it any further than that haha :).  Wait ... why did she make that decision at the end?  thats rash imho

# Quotes from TV #
- Funny Quote from AVGN
    - Predator
    The Nerd: (sarcastically) Wow, they sure followed the movie pretty closely. You know the plot: A special forces team led by Alan "Dutch" Schaefer dressed in hot pink go on a mission to rescue hostages in Central America. They are hunted by piranha balloons, plants that spit fireballs, Lolos or Shy Guys, chickens with skull masks, giant bacteria, Metroids, and birds that crap blood. 
- Bong
    - Statistical fact: Cops will never pull over a man with a huge bong in his car. Why? They fear this man. They know he sees further than they and he will bind them with ancient logics.
